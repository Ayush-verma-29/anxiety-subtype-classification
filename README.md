# Anxiety Subtype Classification from Reddit Posts

This project focuses on automatically classifying anxiety-related social media posts into clinically meaningful subtypes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

The anxiety subtypes considered are:
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
- Panic Disorder
- Social Anxiety

The system uses Reddit data, transformer-based text embeddings, sentiment analysis, keyword-based weak supervision, and multiple classifiers. An interactive Streamlit dashboard is provided for visualization and prediction.

## ?? Project Objectives

- Collect anxiety-related posts from Reddit using the Reddit API
- Apply weak supervision for initial subtype labeling
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns
- Generate semantic embeddings using Sentence-BERT
- Train and compare multiple classification models
- Improve minority class performance (especially GAD)
- Build an interactive dashboard for visualization and inference
