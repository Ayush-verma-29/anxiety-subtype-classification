1poydsr,"Looking for Someone Who Has Been Through Something Similar - Grief, Panic, Stress","Hi Everyone! I am hoping to hear some opinions on whether people think I had a panic attack or not. I know that no one here is a doctor, so I guess I just want to tell my story and see if this is has happened to anyone else. I guess I should start with saying I have really good years versus really bad years, so I have never been officially medicated for anxiety because I somehow always “snap” myself out of it. I had a really bad bout with some panic back in 2018 because I had Hashimoto’s Disease and did not know it. Once that got figured out, things normalized though I carried some medical PTSD around from bad doctors and experiences just trying to get that diagnosed and medication dosage correct. I have had a therapist since that time. In September 2024, my mother died after a three year fight with a horrible cancer. Somehow I held it in the road because I’m the only daughter and the show would not go on without me. After making sure my family still acted as normal as possible, I had a bad case of health anxiety in January 2025. I got everything looked at and was normal again by March. In May, my Dad started calling me complaining of something growing on his face (I’m four hours from him). I pushed him to doctors from afar and they all thought it was a tooth problem. Turns out, it was also cancer. He had a major removal surgery in July 2024 and then radiated. His follow up scan is tomorrow. The thought of this cancer not be gone and losing my remaining parent is killing me. On top of that, my husband started traveling for work much more leaving me alone a lot more this past year. For some reason, I am scared to be alone. I’ve expressed this to him and while he does the have the option of not traveling on every trip, he does so anyway because I think the rest of his team are incapable of making presentations. This is actually true because I’ve heard the phone calls/read his work emails and texts. It’s not a lie to get away from me lol. In October, my “boss” basically decided that he was going to beef with the longest tenured employee at our office over some mistakes she had made and something else really petty. It was a long drawn out show that ended up with her being let go. On the day she was let go, it was my birthday and I was in Florida. It made me incredibly anxious because she and I were friends and confidants in the work place. I worried she would retaliate and reveal some not so nice things I’ve said about working there. My boss also called me all day that day to rehash her conversation with her. I’m sort of like second or third in command there. Also, I am in charge of celebrating everyone’s birthday in the office and everyone forgot mine. After Florida, I had a two week sinus infection. All of this pretty much places us at Thanksgiving where I cook for my whole family, decorate my parents’ home (I still call it that even though my mom is gone) for Christmas, and place flowers on her grave. It consumes the whole four days I have off and then my husband and I have to make the four hour drive back. On the following day, I return to work and admittedly I’m a little tense because I worried the laid off coworker would show on her last day and my husband was leaving on the next day for a work trip. After lunch, out of nowhere, I had some palpitations and got really scared. I thought I was going to die in the office. I called for 9-1-1 and an ambulance came and of course, I was tachy with a high BP when they came. We went to the ER - trop levels good, ekg good, ECGs good. Thyroid number was almost 12. They really didn’t say much of anything to me and just told me to follow up with my endo and PCP. Since then, I’ve had more PVCs and such a hard time coping thinking I have a heart condition or something. I wore a monitor last week and am waiting on the results. If you’ve made it this far, thank you so much. I just want to know if you think my life is overly stressful and could cause this hiccup or if you’ve experienced something similar. Also, I don’t want to give away too many details on what I do for a living on here but just now that I had to get a professional degree for three years, work in an office, and I may have to wear a suit pretty frequently to argue about money.

1poy2jl,Muscle fatigue and low energy,"Somewhere around mid-high school, I started noticing that my arms and legs would get sore and tired very quickly. This happened while biking and exercising, and I was constantly exhausted, often falling asleep during classes despite trying to stay awake.

Nowadays, it affects everyday life. Walking up stairs or working with my arms above shoulder height makes my muscles feel like they have no energy, forcing me to rest. Even at work this physically holds me back after screwing above my head, I often need to lower my arms for a few seconds before I can continue. 

When I wake up, my back and chest feel quickly fatigued and sore, often with a mild feeling of breath hunger or oxygen shortage. 

I also have frequent muscle twitches. People notice that I sigh sometimes and think I’m irritated, but I feel like I’m just trying to get enough air.

I struggle heavily with concentration at work, to the point where colleagues notice it. Coffee helps somewhat. I fall asleep suddenly during meetings, lessons, or while using public transport, even in noisy environments. It comes on abruptly. I’ve also had derealisation since primary school.

At some point, I became afraid I had a muscle or neuromuscular disease. After seeing many doctors, I was referred to the hospital. EMGs of my limbs, respiratory tests, and extensive blood work all came back normal.

Recently, I was tested for chronic hyperventilation and scored 100% on all parts; my carbon dioxide levels were clearly too low. This surprised me, as I never noticed myself hyperventilating. I’ve always known I have social anxiety, sometimes severe, but I never expected it to impact my physical health this much.

I’m still unsure whether all of this can be explained by chronic hyperventilation. At the same time, I’m at least somewhat relieved, and even a bit glad that there is finally something that has been diagnosed. 

Hearing from others with similar experiences would really help.",1765982136.0,anxiety

1pox7cu,Work and self-purpose anxiety,"Hi, this will be a longer as I need to write this out. I'm 33 and I haven't got any strong tendency to any career in my life. I have never really examined what I like when I was younger as I was raised in small city in central Europe where wasnt much to do. So I chose college pragmatically, I was good in math and logical thinking so I went to economics college. There I found out I dont like finance, accounting or anything similar. I moved to city close to my family where IT sector was booming so I started as application administrator. I was quite good at it but it wasnt still ""my calling"". Then I wanted to earn more so I changed teams and technology, that wasnt good decision as team wasnt good and new technology too hard to learn. I quit and tried to sell designs online, I decided I wanted to learn graphic design as I was interested about Etsy, Redbubble on youtube. I found out it is not as easy to be successful as youtube videos trying to show you. After half year I went back to IT as I needed money, again wrong team, terrible application with lot of escalations. I quit again and officialy my work anxiety began as I look retrospectively.  I tried to sell on Etsy one more time putting all my energy into it and to learning graphic design for 4 months. Again not successful enough. I tried to find job in graphic design or marketing. As there were only few job opportunities for self taught graphic designer with little experience I found job in marketing where was stressful environment with worcoholic boss and toxic team. My work anxiety fully developed as I was vomiting in the morning before work and went to psychiatrist. Now I am taking meds and tried to work in retail as shop assistant but I hated it so now I am jobless. And I write a book - fantasy scifi new adult genre which I like to do but still I dont earn money doing it. No idea what to do next. I am thinking about going to  psychic lol.

1powrb1,"Anxiety was the smoke, not the fire","
I want to share my story.
As far as professionals are concerned, I have a general anxiety disorder. Diagnosed at 33. Nothing before that. One period of “Stress” when I was 18 but that’s only because I wanted some time off work.


I could never put into words what I was feeling, from that very first “whoosh” at 33 which then caused panic. Like someone took my breath away and tilted everything 90 degrees for a split second and i disassociated. Those first 3 days I was a mess. Crying on the phone to my Doctor about what this was. Was I dying? Full impending doom!

Then years of being told its Anxiety. I guess it was but the Anxiety wasn’t the start of the river. The anxiety was further downstream. Something was causing this… fluctuation, causing me to be wired 24/7 and I tried everything. I studied my degree in Psychology, I had to reaffirm my identity. I wanted to understand myself so I delved into my past, my traumas, my mistakes. If this was anxiety then there was a cause, if I knew the cause then there was a solution. I wrote and I wrote and I wrote.

I jumped feet first into key life changing moments in my life. Finding out I was a donor baby. Losing my Mum. My marriage breaking down. Some childhood trauma events.

I tried every herbal remedy going. I read books on Vitamin D being the cause, Calcium, Magnesium, water intake needing to be more (a whole book on bloody water) Electrolytes. Books on B12, B6. K2. Potassium. Salt. Sunlight. Morning Sun, evening Sun, Circadian Rhythm. Sleep cycles, Lunar cycles

I got into breathing exercises. Pranayama, Nadi Shodhana, Self talking, self-soothing, self-parenting, birdsong, sounds of the forest. The sound of my own voice reassuring me. TRE- Trauma Releasing Excercising. Patting, Prodding, Yoga, High Intense Training. Mammalian Dive Reflex. Cold face packs.

 

Breathing! Breathwork. Facial muscle changes in Humans from processed soft foods. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, talking therapy, touch therapy, Hypnosis.

It became a perpential cycle. It became an obsession, a health anxiety in its own right. The search for the cause became the cause itself. It was a minefield. Just when I thought I’d mastered it, 2 days later I was back on my ass.

All of these things worked, a little. But only if I balanced all these things absolutely perfectly I could have a good day but there was too many variables and I’d never have two good days in a row. Maybe they worked because I wanted them to work, maybe they were placebo.

 

I became an expert in talking about identity. I was adamant it was linked to that with going through my own identity crisis a few years earlier. I talked about Identity like I had it all figured out. I didn’t and still don’t.

Diazepam was lovely but I’ve seen what a Benzo addiction looks like and I don’t want that. I was allowed 28 per year. Generally it was the only relief I got. Having to balance 28 blocks of 4 hour relief. 112 hours per year of relief.

I had the stigma of having Anxiety, the looks you get, the comments of being “weak”.

The huffs from people when you decline to do something. The empathy sometimes but also the disappointment in their eyes.

All the time I was going through this, I held down a job, I climbed my career although I’m known for being firey. I’m a good dad and believe in being a morally good person. I started a successful relationships but no one every described me as patient.
It took everything I had to not sit in the corner and rock. Exhausting is an understatement. The more I masked, the more it took out of me, the worse I was the next day.

it began to shape me. I was no longer care free. I was no longer the funny guy people knew me as. I was becoming bitter and defensive. The fear of it caused fear itself. The anxiety became about the anxiety.

 

It was getting worse, I had a full on panic attack trying to go into a theatre with my daughter, the shame I felt as a grown man that I couldn’t emotionally get through the door because I was crying and my 10 year old Daughter saw that. She didn’t know that I’d had “whooshs” all day and was already suffering even with Diazepam.


I found myself not wanting to go anywhere where I was trapped, either physically like a plane or socially at a theatre.
7 Years of being told I had anxiety. “You’ve got anxiety, some people just get it”
A few times I doubted myself, there was a period where I just accepted that I did have it. But it always sat at the back of my mind. “This is an imbalance of something, you’ve just got to find out what it is”

 

I started to rename it. I didn’t have Anxiety. I had an imbalance to my nervous system. My nervous system was firing constantly when no danger was present. It wasn't me that was broken, it was my nervous system.
Most of this was internal. I struggled internally a lot and wouldn’t tell anyone because to say it out loud would it give it a voice.

I felt like absolute shit and I didn’t know why. I would catatrophise on my own health. I would seem really impatient from an outside point of view and I would overthink things. They didn’t know that by the time we started talking at 10am, I’d already done a whole day of fighting and flighting.

 

Christmas was always a difficult time for me and when I consumed most of my Diazepam. The deadlines, the gifts, the parties, the foods, the alcohol, the responsibilities of being a parent and “is it enough”

 

Alcohol was a gamble. Sometimes it provided relief, sometimes it took a worst turn when I was already drunk. The hangxiety was terrible.

 

I was due a minor operation and in my pre-op I had my blood pressure taken but this time they took it seriously and kept me for an hour to see if it would go down. It didn’t. My highest on that day was 190/125.

I asked the consultant if this would explain anxiety and he answered in a way that made me feel like I’m an idiot for never even considering it.

Not once did I ever suspect High Blood Pressure was the cause. I’m a Healthcare professional and its constantly documented that Hypertension is a silent killer, no symptoms, no clues. 
Well it wasn’t so silent with me!
Every time I had my blood pressure taken, they marked it as White Coat Hypertension. They said things like “Oh that’s high, but you are nervous and you have just walked in here”
I never made the link because there is so little evidence out there that I’ve seen.

 

I’m 4 weeks into a new blood pressure tablet and I haven’t felt like this in 7 years.
To the point where I’ve even tried to internalise to see if the anxiety is in there and it isn’t.

I’ve gone out to dinner, a party, a work meeting with 40 people in one room with the exit on the other side. An Elevator and all at my worst time of the year. Nothing, not a quiver is there, no negative thoughts about being trapped. No dizziness, no surreal moments, no dissociation.

I actually felt nerves the other day. Like real nerves, butterflies in the stomach. Real nerves for a real situation. I haven’t felt that in years. Whenever I should have felt that, my body just dumped a shit tonne of adrenaline into my blood stream and then I’d crash a few hours after being an impatient dickhead.

I also felt thirst. Another thing I haven’t felt in years unless it was extreme. My body didn’t have time for these little introspective clues. It’s been fighting since 2018.


I feel like I have my life back and I’m incredibly proud of myself for living those 7 years on full flight or fight and still managing to hold a life together.
Although I am cold now. 7 years of constantly being too hot and adrenalated and now I'm out the other side, it's bloody freezing and I don't have the wardrobe for it anymore.

 

In hindsight. Yes, I do have Anxiety but only when my blood pressure is reading an average of 180/120.
On the bright side, at least I know how I act under enormous pressure. Incoherant, rushing everything at 90mph, dizzy and detached with the occasional crying episode. But I never ran or quit and i soooo wanted to.

I’m sharing this because I know how important it is to read success stories and to feel “seen”. To know there is a light at the end of the tunnel and for some, maybe Vit D is the reason. Maybe TRE will be the key to your trauma healing.

If I hadn’t had a proactive Doctor then I would have been on this path for years without finding the answer. I think our own Anxiety is worth exploring. Some times it is a physical reason. Other times we are our own worst enemy and the cause is our own internal thought pattern and coping mechanisms. 
Its about balance. Trying something new but not obsessing over it.


This is not an argument against anxiety. I lived it for 7 years and I felt it every god damn day, constant impending doom and my soul is tired but hopefully that door has closed now and I can continue to be an advocate for understanding it.
 
This is an argument for curiosity when it starts late and feels physical.


This might not be the end of it. I may be back in 3 months debating whether it's better to breath out for 4 seconds or 6 but it feels different this time and it's been miles longer than any previous attempt.

Keep going. There's always a light.",1765978777.0,anxiety
1pow5lo,My brief guide to temporary - long term alleviation of physical symptoms,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for most of my conscious life and for a long time, I didn’t realise it was anxiety. I’m sure a lot of people can relate to that. 
What has remained is my physical reaction following or preceding bouts of anxiety; perhaps the most disconcerting aspect of anxiety, for me at least.
As I’ve built up techniques and such over the years, I figured I’d share them. I really hope that this post can give at least one person some relief, if not provide a post for people to discuss their own techniques :) 

1. Vapour Rub / Peppermint Oil (or peppermint smelling things like toothpaste) / Lavender / Rubbing Alcohol
Good for: Stomach, throat and chest symptoms. 
What a LIFE SAVER. As someone who has a very intense sense of smell, I find smells that are either positively nostalgic (like vapour rub, and the memories of taking a sick day off of school and watching YouTube while it rains outside) or just calming for my body (like peppermint or lavender) to be helpful in grounding. Intense smells such as the eucalyptus/methanol of vapour rub or peppermint can actually help you feel the sensation of air hitting the back of your throat. This can be very assuring if you suffer from throat tightness, globes sensations or feelings of discomfort when breathing. This (for me, at least) can have a run-off affect for my chest tightness, and help alleviate that. Rubbing alcohol and peppermint have also helped with nausea; this is very old knowledge that was used by many generations of people. Don’t knock it till you try it ! 

2. Ginger tea / lollies / pickle / …raw?
Good for: Stomach symptoms
Classic. Any form of ginger has been known to calm the stomach, especially as you feel an acidic bubbling. Typically relief is within 5/10 mins, but this can vary. My preferred forms are: ginger tea (around 2x2inch piece of peeled ginger root with a squeeze of lime juice, a piece of lime and honey as desired), ginger lollies (gin gins are amazing and come in many different strengths… the extra strong is my fav!) pickled ginger (yes, the type you often get with sushi) or even raw (small, small amounts to start. This is a desperate measure!) 

3. Breathe in.. and then breathe some more!
Good for: throat and chest symptoms.
Massive credit to whoever posted this on reddit some years ago. It’s a technique I can’t live without when my respiratory symptoms play up. Here’s what you do: breathe in through the nose, all the way until your chest feels like it’s filled with air. Then, take one more big SNIFF. Then, breathe out through the mouth. I often feel instant relief, but rinse and repeat as needed! 

4. Heat packs / hot showers 
Good for: stomach, throat and chest symptoms.
Heat on areas that feel tense or cramping can often provide near immediate relief. This can also feel like a grounding sensation, which is particularly good when paired with breathing techniques. 

5. Legs up ladies!
Good for: head symptoms.
So, one night I went to a concert. I decided that eating beforehand wasn’t in my best interests, and well, I collapsed towards the end. Thankfully, I fainted surrounded by a group of nurses! (If there’s any chance you are seeing this, I’m still grateful, and I really hope I don’t ruin your night :’)) So what did they do? They placed my calves onto their legs and let the blood flow return. And I awakened! This is now a trick I do when I feel dizzy or uncomfortable in my head. So all you do is: lay down flat next to an elevated surface (couch is usually easiest, if not a few stacked pillows) and place your legs onto that surface, making sure your hips are still on the ground. Imagine the letter ‘Z’ but if that middle line was straight. Stay there for a few minutes and let your body do its thing. 

6. Got any games on your phone?
Good for: general anxiety symptoms.
Unfortunately I was lucky enough to be stuck in an elevator once. What got me through? Candy crush. Sometimes the brain just needs an immediate distraction, and it might not always work, but it could also help. Big up the YouTube playables; they’re quick, simple, fast, and vary in demand for concentration / thought. This can often have a run-off affect to your physical symptoms, aiding as a distraction until the feeling has passed. 

7. The magic pack
Good for: all ! 
I really suggest that if you like these techniques or if you have some of your own, always take an ‘anxiety pack’ with you! It’s always a good feeling to have something you can rely on, so even if it’s just one item, I really suggest having something with you to be your lifeline in the unlikely event of sudden anxiety. 

I hope you found something interesting, or even something genuinely helpful! There are so many other techniques, I really suggest commenting to help share the community spirit and bring hope. Anxiety can be debilitating, but even if for a brief moment, there could be a way for you to have some relief and I hope I’ve helped in that journey <3

1pove65,I had a realisation on Monday,"

(I put TW as flair as I would prefer to be safe and not trigger someone’s anxiety.)

I was speaking with a friend I’ve known for about 10 years now on Monday. While we were talking the realisation that this is the first face to face conversation that I’ve had with someone in weeks. He asked how long I’ve been doing this and I realised after the covid lockdowns, I never really left that isolation. 

For context, for the past five years I’ve practically confined myself to one spot depending on where I am. I barely leave the house, even if work requires me to go to the office I have been to the office a collective five times this year. Out of a required two-three times a week. When I caught up with my friend, I had my blinds and windows open to let light and fresh air in, yet when I’m alone I shut my entire house, my only real light sources being my work laptop and personal computer.

Now I know that’s not a healthy lifestyle and I do not recommend it. For context, I’m 27, and I’ve dealt with anxiety and other things for close to 15 years at this point. All that to say.

I went out on the request of my friend tonight to a party, and I’ve never felt so uncomfortable as I did at that Christmas party. I wasn’t in my space, I couldn’t play the new game I bought (COE33) and I was around people I know who care about me but I just couldn’t stop myself from isolating in a corner away from everyone. It’s a first step, and it was uncomfortable as fuck, but while a part of me wishes I’d stayed home, another part of me is glad I could see everyone again.

Sorry if this breaks any rules or anything wasn’t my intention at all so if mods remove it that’s fine.

1pouosy,Living With Undiagnosed Chronic Anxiety Feels Like a Never-Ending Panic [TW: EXISTENTIAL QUESTIONS],"Hi, i won't disclose my name but im a 16 year old African girl who is dealing with undiagnosed chronic anxiety and frequent panic attacks. 

(The reason i mentioned that im African is cuz no one takes your anxiety seriously in here. Psychological care/therapy is almost impossible to find, that's why, i say ""undiagnosed"" instead of ""diagnosed"" so that u understand my situation better) 

I don’t even know where to start. Every morning I wake up hoping I won’t feel panicky, like I’m bracing myself for my own brain. It’s exhausting.

Some days, my thoughts spiral so fast that I feel like I’m losing control, and even small things can trigger a wave of panic. I get these overwhelming “what if” loops about life and existence, and sometimes I can’t stop questioning everything, like why I exist, where do we come from? or what’s the point of it all.

It’s not that I want to give up or anything, it’s just tiring. I feel trapped inside my own head, constantly fighting my body and brain just to feel normal for a few minutes. Even when I know it’s anxiety and not reality, it doesn’t stop the fear or the racing thoughts.

I just wish my brain would let me rest and i want cry so bad right now because i see my peers living normally while I struggle with this anxiety and panic attacks. I had my last panic attack last month and this year i had a total of 5-6 panic attacks. It genuinely hurts to live like this im not going to lie. Sometimes i wish i was dealing with other mental illnesses other than chronic anxiety

1pou7qq,"Please help, what's happening to me? Is this OCD? Am I going crazy? I'm desperate and I don't understand.","Okay so, I've been struggling a lot for like 4 months now. And it's not like it came out of nowhere, but nothing like this has ever happened to me before, so I'm very confused. When I started uni I struggled with health anxiety and panic attacks, then agoraphobia, but all that went away after a while. Now I'm struggling again but completely differently.

I'd like to preface this story by saying that I never struggled with intrusive thoughts or anything like that when I was younger. The first time something like that even occured to me was when there was that tripophobia thing circling the internet where I thought how peculiar it was that something that didn't make me uncomfortable before now made me uncomfortable because someone told me it should. Then a thought crossed my mind that if it can happen with this, it can happen with other things. But not much changed. Then years later, I was learning about OCD for a class in uni and I got so scared of the thought that it could be possible to implant anything you want into your mind. And that's where all hell began for me. I'd have a random thought and be like ""oh no, what if this sticks now"". I'd also like to add that I've suffered with some tics here and there and what rly scared me was implementing ticks. So I would get rly scared and then start doing the tick because I can't get it out of my head and so I'd prove my own theory that I can implement anything into my own head. Just like that I implemented into my own mind that I won't be able to sleep because a friend told me that she keeps waking up early unable to fall back asleep. And since then I have had fear of sleeping on and off and even issues with failling asleep, but not because I'm not tired, but because I kept jolting awake in fear. Another thing, I've also had big freakouts in the past about random stuff I ""implemented"" inside my mind. One time I made myself feel like I can't speak and I would legit struggle to start speaking. But I could still forget about it if I plays a game or something. But that went away too. so basically I've had anxious freakouts and hyperfocus on things for a while. It's like I always needed something to be anxious about. That said none of that existed before that big revelation that you can implement anything in my last year of uni. But sadly, things got really bad for me this summer.

 In mid August I started having stomach pains after prolonged stress in life and at work. I had countless labs, and after a few weeks I was diagnosed with IBS, which got me extremely scared since I googled and learned it was incurable. I got very anxious, lost my appetite, and got hyperfixated on fixing the issue. After a while it was all that I could think about. I was so scared and frustrated that I couldn't get it out of my head that it quickly turned into a fear of not being able to get it out of my head and relax. Which is so stupid I know. It got so bad that I was prescribed Prazepam, which I took for like 2 months. I want to add that even at my worst in the past when I got prescribed benzos, I didn't really take them and only took a little when I couldn't sleep before an exam or so. 

Prazepam helped a bit, but I was still scared, hyperfocused on my stomach, crying several times a day, and became disinterested in anything else. I got off it because you're only supposed to take it for 2 months.

A few days before I stopped taking it, I experienced a worsening with my stomach, so I started extreme dieting again and slowly started tapering off the drug. Days later I completely lost my appetite, then I got scared what might happen if I now thought about appetite loss every time I ate and got anxiety because of it, so my appetite would never return and it would be the same as sleep. This spiraled very quickly. This part happened at the very end of October and since then I've been very anxious, with almost no ability to disconnect from my thoughts about all this. And it's not always active thoughts. I can watch a show for example, but i'm unable to just watch it and forget about all this, there's still this feeling in the back of my mind that's creating a knot in my stomach. Like I get a second of peace and it's back to this terrible feeling and me trying to relax and not notice it. So far I've tried to block it, ignore it, rise above it, everything. But now I'm so poorly that I can barely eat, I start randomly gagging for like 10 times in a row, keep jolting awake at night with this terrible pit in my stomach. I can't focus on anything else. And I'm especially unable to relax. Like when I go to sit and watch tv or play a game my mind goes ""okay here it comes, now, RELAX"" and the feeling kicks in again. I also feel traumatised by all this, so even thinking about a previous day makes it feel like I'm reliving a traumatising event. I'm completely unable to function or do anything. My stomach is still so bad, I tried so many different doctors, meds and supplements. But it's not even about the stomach anymore.

I'd also like to say that I had some pockets of days where I had some appetite or a few good hours or so. Sometimes the thoughts or the feeling will be there still, but I'd feel better. Especially on a short trip to Switzerland this month. There I even slept most night for 8-9h with some sleep meds. However, ever since I came back a week ago it's been hell. I've spiraled so much. Right now my days are hell and my nights even worse. Even with the meds I keep jolting awake nauseous and then I keep trying to calm myself down, by thinking about something else, which I'm unable to do most of the time, but the frustration just grows and I keep feeling worse and worse. And my brain just keeps adding new things to be anxious about. What if this, what if that. And then it really starts feeling whatever it imagines. 

Right now I'm in bed just googling, unwilling to start my day. Please help me. It feels like my life is over. I'm so scared that I won't ever be able to relax or think about anything else. I'm unable to feel anything or get excited about anything. I'm just anxious and scared. What's wrong with me? Have I created OCD for myself? Is this anxiety? Where do I go? What do I do? Please I'm at my wit's end. And the worst thing is, I know that If I could just forget about all this, i'd be myself again. I even started having these pictures in my mind of myself hospitalised where I'm so unwell or unable to exist that the only way to fix it is to put me down.

Please fellow Redditors, help a sister out. I don't even understand what this is. I was a slightly anxious individual several months ago,  and now I'm... This...

1potybz,How I finally quit vaping and kept my anxiety under control,"Just wanted to share something that’s helped me in case it helps someone else. 

I’ve struggled with anxiety for a long time, and vaping became this constant crutch. I began not really enjoying the vape, so I wanted to quit - but my anxiety just wouldn’t let me.

Every time I tried to stop suddenly, my anxiety spiked and it felt like too much, so I’d end up going back to it.

What finally worked for me was taking the pressure off completely.

Instead of quitting, I just delayed my first vape of the day. No rules, no punishment, no forcing it. Even pushing it back 10 minutes each day felt manageable, and weirdly, that alone reduced my anxiety because I wasn’t fighting myself all day.

Over time, the urges softened and the panic around needing it faded. It took me about 50 days - by slowly pushing my first vape of the day later and later, it eventually blended into my bedtime, and one day I realised I’d gone the whole day without vaping.

This approach felt way kinder on my nervous system than cold turkey ever did. No gum, no replacements, no white-knuckling.

Honestly, the feeling is like no other -finally beating a habit I’d struggled with for years. It felt like a little win in a world that can be pretty harsh.

Not saying it’s for everyone - just sharing in case anyone else feels like quitting makes their anxiety spiral. Sometimes easing off instead of ripping the band aid can make a big difference.

I’ve put all the steps and tips into a small guide. If you want it, send me a message and I’ll happily share.

About 6 months ago I was in a weird spot in my addiction I had just got out of rehab and went balls to the wall I got some cocaine , Valium , alcohol , n tramadol/Xanax capsules and the night went drank 20 something shots n popped 2 tramadol xan caps and a valium or 2 and did some coke 

(this was my 2nd time doing coke)

(The tramadol Xan capsules were supposedly crushed up Xanax and tramadol in a capsule)

As you can assume I blacked out that night and I fought my step dad apparently and long story short got the cops called and got locked up 
and I got searched and had the pills on me , and the tramadol/xan caps I had came back from the lab and one of them had fentanyl and some had tramadol but no Xanax smh

And let me also put I went through 80 valium 5mg pills in a 2 week span a little before this incident 

Since that day I've stopped doing shit I only do shrooms alcohol and smoke weed now but my anxiety is actually unbearable I have panic attacks daily it's the worst while sleeping I wake up tryna breathe for air n shit n my heart drops to my stomach 

My anxiety has always been bad and a challenge in life but nowadays it's so bad I just want to sit in my room and isolate 

I don't feel comfortable in my own skin any human interaction makes me anxious and it kills my self confidence and I feel like a ""pussy"" I look down on my self for it even tho it's something out of my control

 When I get into verbal arguments with people there's this constant lump in my throat and if I'm panicked my voice will shake like a leaf , I used to be able to be very calm in situations engaging aggressive people now i feel like a little pussy

Im on a medication called buspar for anxiety and it doesn't help at all and I've tried a few other medications, no luck either

Nowadays I can't even drink energy drinks caffeine sends me into panic mode I get cold and jittery of 80mg of caffeine low doses and just feel like shit and it makes my already bad heart palpitations worse 

(I also want to add before this I used to abuse dxm for about 2 years and have done hella fake acid)

I don't get it tho my anxiety shouldnt be this bad I know people who have done hella hard drugs and are fine they have anxiety but not like I do

For instance I can walk into the living room and my heart can sink to my stomach for no reason , or I can see a message at the top of my screen otp same shit

1poqwkk,Waking up with anxiety attacks and diarrhea,"(Light trigger warning for mention of abuse once)

Hi, I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but I could really use some help.

I (23F) have had severe GAD (general anxiety disorder) since I was a teenager, along with severe depression resulting from it, but also from intense studies and childhood abuse.
I'd also like to mention that I have a huge phobia of diarrhea after repeated illnesses I had when I was little, or so I guess. But this phobia has been there since I was a child and I can't remember when it even started. Not the most glamourous phobia to have and I always hate to mention it, but I managed to control it and even overcome a bit of it since then. And of course, I deal with IBS-D. A great combo. But just so you know that when I get diarrhea, it actively triggers my anxiety, which triggers more my bowel, etc. A never-ending cycle. 

Usually, when I suddenly get an anxiety attack, I'm able to go through it without much consequences and carry on with my day. This is thanks to my antidepressants (Efexor, also known as Venlafaxine) I've been taking for five years now. Now, I've tried, with my psychiatrist, several antidepressants for my severe depression (even accidentally exceeding the normal dose in blood without even noticing it) for a few years and none worked, but Venlafaxine actually helped with my bowel movements by slowing it down considerably. It felt like heaven because I was able to function again without that angry bowel of mine and my anxiety was more manageable; I still had my GAD and some attacks but without much consequences. Which is why I continued taking them with the approval of my psychiatrist. Of course, living a normal professional/school life again improved my depression, so it was a win-win. 

When it comes to anxiolytics, however, and just like antidepressants for my depression, none worked so far. My psychiatrist thus suggested I had treatment-resistant depression/anxiety, which means my brain just doesn't respond to these meds. So therapy is my only and last hope, and I've been under therapy for a decade now, starting before the meds. So therapy is my only and last hope, and I’ve been in therapy for a decade now, having started before medication. It's been a bit helpful but nothing grand, unfortunately. 

Now, why I'm making this post—finally. I mentioned I've been able to manage my IBS and diarrhea episodes thanks to my antidepressants for five years now, even when under severe anxiety. But since september, I've had a new form of anxiety attack when I wake up, triggering my bowel like never before and, of course, my phobia, which worsens even more my anxiety, etc. I let you guess what happens next. It usually stop after I go to the bathroom, though it leaves me weak for a few days. It happens very randomly and I can have nothing for weeks. All I know is that it only happens in the morning, just after waking up. But it has been triggering my phobia again, and it feels like everything I’ve worked on, mostly for these past 5 years—whether for my anxiety or my phobia—has just blown up. I don't even know where it comes from. No medication can help with that as you've just read, and I don't know what to do. I'm at a loss. I'm already underweight so losing more weight could be serious. My psychiatrist isn't available before February. It impacts my job and my uni studies and leaves my ashamed to call in sick because of that. Sometimes I still go because I have to, but I can't work for the first few hours because I'm stuck in the toilets. I'm so afraid I have to quit my job I've worked so hard on getting because of that stupid disorder. 

Have you guys experienced the same thing, where suddenly, in your life, your anxiety flares up again like never before? If yes, what was your solution, if you found one? My situation is a tricky one, and I wish medication could work on me. 

I could really use a hug rn! Thank you for reading and I'm sorry if my English is a bit funny; it's not my mother tongue. 

Tldr; Anxiety isn't new for me and medication doesn't work because treatment-resistant. I could manage these past few years because an antidepressant stopped most of my bowel movements and thus reduced my anxiety. However, since september, I experience new anxiety attacks that give me severe diarrhea even with my medications. I don't know how to handle that and it feels like everything I've worked on for years just fell apart. ",1765958098.0,anxiety

1popppx,Ongoing physical symptoms + anxiety spiral — struggling to feel normal again,"Hi everyone,

I’m posting here because I’ve been having a really hard time and I don’t know how to break out of this cycle.

About 7 weeks ago I started feeling unwell. At first I thought it was just the flu, but it never really stopped. I felt constantly tired and off, without being able to clearly explain what was wrong. Because of this, I ended up doing a lot of tests: multiple blood tests, X-rays, an ultrasound, and even going to the ER. Everything came back completely normal, except for ferritin, which was elevated (around 370, with the upper limit being ~250).

I’ve spoken with two doctors, and both told me that there’s nothing to do right now and that all the tests look fine overall. Physically, things have started to improve a bit, but this long period of feeling unwell really triggered my anxiety. 

Everyone just say that I’m recovery from a virus or something similar and it might take a lot of months. 

Now I’m stuck in a constant loop of checking my body for symptoms and thinking that something terrible is wrong or that I’m about to die, even though the doctors say I’m okay. Some days I feel bad physically, other days it feels like the anxiety itself is what’s making me feel bad — and most days it’s probably both. Either way, I don’t feel like I can have a normal day anymore.

I had been doing much better with anxiety before all of this, and it’s really discouraging to feel like I’m back at the beginning again. I guess I’m just looking to hear from anyone who’s been through something similar — especially health anxiety after a long, unexplained physical issue — and how you managed to cope or slowly feel normal again.",1765953648.0,anxiety

1pop1qu,Check Your Weight,"Okay so it probably should’ve been obvious but if u have a history of elevated blood pressure even at a healthy weight, u probably shouldn’t go overboard with how much u are eating

Been to the ER twice and general check up once. Done the EKG multiple times because of suspected heart problem (They would always start with the blood pressure finger monitor and then they would escalate to the ekg, I’ve been through it at least 3 times)

Anyways, after trying to narrow down the million possible things that could be causing the crippling anxiety, I’ve found that slimming down greatly alleviated it

At my peak weight I was still at a healthy BMI but I had always been skinny so I guess my body wasn’t used to the bulk. I dropped down a significant bit and must have crossed some threshold where my body is able to comfortably sustain my blood pressure.

I get time's where I'm anxious about everything: going out, something going wrong... everything going wrong. And I just can't stop myself, I'll just be constantly worrying and restless.

Then there's times I get focused on a specific topic such as my health, fire and dying in my sleep.

And right now I'm in my fire period again. This means I'm constantly worried the house will set on fire, that I won't be able to prevent it, that I'll get stuck, that I'll lose all my documents, that I can't get my dog out (he's a cane corso and sleeps in a cage or he will eat things).

When I cook I have to stand  there the whole time watching if it'll start smoking or if something will go wrong. I have to unplug everything if I'm not currently using it or I think it'll burst into flames. 
I'm paranoid if anything smells slightly off, cause I think something is going to happen 

I just don't know what to do anymore. My life is a mess, I barely sleep (it's literally 5.30am) the only time I went out was to the gym but they've shut till April for refurbishment. I'm trying to find a job, but between my anxiety and other health problems I'm not able to do most things, because I stupidly set my heart on wanting to study at a expensive university - Norland.

I do live with my mum but we don't really talk about mental health. I also don't have any friends, we all just lost touch through time.

1poo936,Prenatal anxiety. First time in my life. HELP.,"So I have never suffered from anxiety before I didn’t even really know what it was until I started suffering about three weeks ago and it’s been horrible. Like if I am awake 16 hours the 16 hours I will be thinking of this. Basically I was anxious because I couldn’t sleep well at night and then I started getting panic attacks, especially at night before going to bed because I was scared of going to bed and with that other little obsessive thoughts came that makes no sense like coughing make me anxious or not being able to breathe. Well congestion you know make me anxious and even now I have recovered a lot since Sunday thanks to a blessing I received at church. It really helped me. I’m like a new person now but now I still struggle with intrusive thoughts, and what sends me off is the thought of what if you have to live like this forever because it’s really interrupting my life. I am 28 weeks pregnant. I can’t even watch TV because I don’t focus. when I was pregnant the first time I had mild depression and just went away by itself. I don’t even remember when so my my hope is that this anxiety is gonna be the same, it’s gonna be gone and I won’t even notice it but right now is technically gone, but I’m still triggered by the thoughts of what if I have to always live like this like I’m escaping from my own head trying to do things to keep me entertained so I’m not ever really relaxing. Has anybody gone through this before? How did you manage it or how are you managing it? I hope to hear some positive stories of women who went through this, and then are completely recovered now.

PS it is so much better right now. I’m not anxious the entire day and I don’t feel anguish the entire day like I used to in the past few weeks, but I still think about this very often and it bothers me and when sometimes it gets really , I start feeling really anxious again and I need to shake it off but it bothers me because I don’t want to have to shake anything off.

1poo4o3,"Health Anxiety has ruined my life, I'm desperate for solutions.","I used to be carefree about health - almost too much so. I didn't have a single Dr's appointment from the ages of 13 to 20 and now I'm making a new one once a week over minor things (22 now). I dealt with hemorrhoids untreated for almost 2 years when suddenly something clicked and I was convinced I was dying of colon cancer. 

Of course I'm not (negative FIT test, normal blood work and hemorrhoids are gone) but now my health anxiety keeps switching to different body sensations. Currently I have a swollen lymph node in my throat that 2 seperate dr's have told me is nothing and that i'm probably just fighting a minor cold. It's so mild I can't even tell if it's real or not which only makes things worse.

Through all of this I met a new Dr who was incredibly reassuring and suggested going on SSRI's which i did but 2 days in I had the worst panic attack of my life. 45 minutes of uncontrollable shaking and the first time I've ever experienced the stereotypical fear of impending doom/death. I was so close to calling an ambulance but my parents reassured me that this was just a panic attack. The shaking didn't resolve until the next morning.

I feel like I've lost myself, I can't focus, can't eat and it's become impossible to find motivation to stay routined in my life. I bombed my finals cause I was so caught up in my own thoughts that when I'd try to study it would dissolve into me palpating my entire body making sure none of my lymph nodes haven't gotten bigger.

I feel like I'm not only letting myself down but also my girlfriend who deals with a real chronic illness. She constantly has to reassure me over the same symptoms that repeatedly freak me out. I'm inspecting my poop, palpating my whole body countless times a day loooking for changed in my lymph nodes and not engaging with friends or any of my old passions (I can't even remember what they were). The worst part is, when I am having fun everything dissapears - I simply am imagining all of what feels like real physical symptoms.

I've spent my whole life being a people pleaser. I'm averagly intelligent but tore myself apart for 5 years to get nearly all A's in school. I've never done anything awful (I took the rice purity test a few months ago and got 99 if that proves my point). I reached a breaking point last year and hated my life and myself. Every day I felt was spent doing ""the right thing"", what people wanted me to do. I got good grades to make my mom proud, not because I want to go to any fancy college. I'm an introvert but went to football games I hates because ""that's what teenagers are supposed to do"". I did everything but never felt like enough because I'm not who my mom waa at my age and I think she hates that. Anyway, I've been working with my therapist a lot. I'm working on letting go. I got my first C and I know it's weird but, I'm proud. It felt like recovery. I have finally broke free of the perfectionist anxiety that chained me so long. However, I find myself not relating to my smart friends anymore, and sometimes the old thoughts still threaten to bring me back. It's a journey but, I guess nothing like this is linear. I started dating my now bf. It's my first time having a bf and I had my first kiss last week. I finally feel like a normal teen, but on my own terms. I stay up late talking on the phone, yap more than I do school work , go to bed late and get up late. I feel I'm finally free to make my own choices and be me even if everyone hates me. My mom made me have a zoom call with my teachers to talk about my performance than sat me down at dinner ro tell me I'm ruining my life and future. I think I'm saving it, in my own way. I don't think shw knows how deep that spiral went. She wants me to go back, to be her perfect little daughter who could never be enough. But, I refuse. I will not ever do that again. I have no idea who I am  but, I know I would do anything to not be who I used to be. I know my past self who despise who I have become, but I just feel bad for her. Maybe I'm the biggest hypocrite, maybe I'm the biggest menace. But, I regret absolutely nothing. I hope I keep learning and being me. Everyone will either get on board or they can go.

It worked for my anxiety but I was having trouble sleeping and my psychiatrist changed it. I've been prescribed effexor for my anxiety and depression but admittedly wasn’t taking it like I was supposed to until about 4/5 months ago. About two months ago (so 3 mo into taking 75mg of effexor) I started getting panic attacks where I convince myself I’m gonna faint, feeling like I’m gonna have a heart attack or a stroke, convincing myself I can’t breathe, etc. Now it’s just been everyday where I’m shaky and on edge, dizzy especially while driving, having really bad derealization, and am just an anxious mess. about two weeks ago my psychiatrist decided to lower my dosage to 37.5 mg to begin tapering because I just want off these meds, and we'd meet again to see what to do from there, though he warned me lowering it may increase these symptoms, and it hasn’t improved at all.  I feel like I can’t take this anymore. I've seen people suggest doing a Prozac bridge to minimize withdrawal symptoms and while i’ve seen people say it works wonders for them, i’ve seen some people say it made their anxiety worse. I literally can’t handle my anxiety getting any worse, it’s affecting my daily life, It takes everything in me to go to work and I’m having panic attacks the whole time convincing myself I’m gonna pass out. I've been prescribed hydroxyzine and propranolol as needed for panic attacks and neither has helped at all . I'm also scared of taking benzo's to help because part of my anxiety is about feeling lightheaded and out of it.

1poni8r,im scared.,"Hey 

I live in Europe/Germany and I am really afraid of dying. 
I have always struggled with depression and passive desires for peace and quiet—but this has gotten much worse in recent months. 

I am not really knowledgeable about political issues; I would say that I am very backward in this area and simply cannot understand how people can hurt other people—it just makes no sense to me. 

I now lie awake very often, waiting for the siren to go off and for me to die. 
I don't know how to describe the feeling. 

I've already tried to avoid the news, but it's not that easy—it feels like everywhere you read: war is coming, people are dying there, another attack... 
Even before this... boom of bad news, I didn't really want to be here—but now the whole thing seems even more pointless to me... 
I don't plan on hurting myself, but I'm somehow losing... the meaning in my life because I'm afraid every day and think that it will all be over soon anyway. 
Sure, anything can happen (car accident, etc.), but... war? Being killed deliberately? 
I'm really, really, really afraid of that. 

Apart from that, I'm even afraid of Nazis now, haha. 
I'm a German/American woman who is disabled, and I'm just afraid. 
Afraid. 
Afraid.
Afraid.

I'm trying to distract myself, but it's getting harder and harder.

Aren't we actually meant to run around naked in the woods, eat berries, and take care of animals? 

Instead, we have to work hard for some colorful printed paper because someone said that's the right thing to do, and we kill each other for some “invisible” borders, deciding that some people are worth less because of some apparent differences, religions or just because we don't like the color of their skin.


I just don't understand it.
I'm slowly reaching my limit. 

I don't want to be in a world like that, simply because I don't understand it. 
And even if I did understand it, I wouldn't want to. 

I don't want to off myself, but somehow I do. 

Simply because I'm afraid and don't understand anything. 


I used a translator for this text because I didn't know how to translate these thoughts—I hope everything still comes across clearly somehow. 
Thanks for reading.

1ponbtk,I couldn’t go through with a medical procedure today,"just wanted to share. I went to the doctor for a non-invasive, supposed to be very quick nose surgery and was incredible nervous for it, because i just don’t like the idea of my body changing in that way especially in this area where i breathe.

But I really did my best to prepare, I took off work and I ate a meal beforehand, I made it all the way to the office and immediately just started crying, nothing had even happened yet. The doctors came in, were very nice, gave me a stress ball and an ativan and explained everything and I felt like I could go through with it.

Then they hit me with a first round of numbing spray & cotton balls in my nose and it was at that point that I began to freak out because I needed to breathe through my mouth and I could feel the numbing happening in my throat and nose and it was just scary. The doctor came in and I explained that the numbing was uncomfortable and he quite soberly said, “well things are going to get more uncomfortable” because they hadn’t even fully numbed me up yet.

And I started crying again and the doctor said he could see I wasn’t ready for this and that we shouldn’t go through with it until im ready.

They kept saying please don’t feel bad lots of people get nervous and we just want you to be comfortable for this but it’s hard not to feel bad about it when I know that this is a super common procedure (it’s getting the turbinates reduced), and I guess, when am I ever going to be ready? I don’t think I’ve ever been to a doctors appointment when u haven’t been nervous. Ive puked at blood draws, I get scared of CT scans, I don’t know why I thought I’d be able to handle this surgery.

1pon7if,Anxiety getting worse after doctor said I have TB without sputum test,"Hi everyone, I’m really struggling mentally right now and I just need to vent and maybe get some perspective.

For about **5 months**, I’ve had a chronic cough. During this time, I’ve **coughed up blood twice** — the second time was recently and it was more than before, which really scared me. Because of that, I finally went to the hospital.

They did a **chest X-ray**, and the doctor said it looks like **tuberculosis**. They wanted to do a **sputum test**, but the machine was broken, so it wasn’t done. Based only on the X-ray, the doctor told me I have TB and started me on medication.

This is where my anxiety completely spiraled.

I don’t really trust the diagnosis because:

* There was **no sputum test**
* I have **no other symptoms** like fever, night sweats, weight loss, or feeling sick
* I feel mostly normal except for the cough, mucus stuck in my throat, and the two times I coughed blood

Now my anxiety is really bad. I keep thinking *what if it’s not TB?* or *what if something else is wrong?* I can’t stop overthinking, and every sensation in my body makes me panic. The coughing blood especially traumatized me.

I know doctors are trained and X-rays can show TB, but my brain keeps doubting everything because there was no lab confirmation. I’m stuck between wanting to trust the doctor and being terrified that something was missed or misdiagnosed.

Has anyone been diagnosed with TB based mainly on X-ray?  
Or dealt with severe anxiety while waiting for confirmation tests?

It’s that awful feeling where the second the lights go out, my chest gets tight and my brain decides to replay every awkward conversation I’ve had since 2012. It’s exhausting and makes me dread going to bed.

I realized recently that the only thing that actually calms me down is... basically being treated like a toddler. I felt silly asking, but I eventually got my boyfriend to tell me a bedtime story about my teddy bear just to get my brain to focus on his voice instead of my thoughts. It worked surprisingly well—it just made me feel safe, I guess? Kind of like how my parents used to read to me when I was little.

The only problem is, I feel incredibly guilty asking him to do this every single night. He’s tired too, and half the time he falls asleep before I do. I tried listening to podcasts, but they were too engaging, and silence just let the anxiety back in.

I went looking for something to fill that gap and stumbled on a platform called Lullaby. It’s been a decent substitute for when my boyfriend is too tired or asleep. You can basically set it up to tell stories in a specific voice, which helps mimic that ""being read to"" feeling without the guilt of keeping someone else awake.

It’s not exactly the same as a real person, obviously, but if you’re single or your partner is a heavy sleeper, it might be worth a shot.

1poma6n,Anyone Else Get Anxiety/Adrenaline/Reflux/Panic Like Symptoms Until They Have a Bowel Movement?,"I have experienced poor gut health since my early teens along with IBS. I am now 30 years old. Over time, I have noticed the development of intense episodes of anxiety and adrenaline that seem to be directly triggered when I become constipated or significantly bloated, particularly when it feels as though there is a heavy buildup of stool in my bowels.

During these episodes, I experience a surge of adrenaline that leads to a range of physical symptoms commonly associated with GERD and panic attacks. These include an increased heart rate, sweating, shaking, and a strong sense of impending doom. I also experience widespread tingling throughout my body—especially on the left side—along with acid reflux that rises into my throat.

Notably, these symptoms resolve almost immediately once I am able to have a bowel movement and feel relief, particularly a sense of lightness in my stomach. At that point, the anxiety subsides, the physical symptoms disappear, and I return to a state of calm and comfort.

I tend to notice these symptoms more when lying down in bed at night. It sometimes feels as though there is a form of internal pressure or compression affecting my nerves, although I’m not certain what exactly causes this feeling",1765942387.0,anxiety

I have been starting to feel more feelings of just wanting to do nothing and be alone as opposed to anxiety feeling although i still have them

1poldr3,I think I might have aspirated some water and I'm currently panicking,"It happened last night at 10 PM, I was coughing pretty intensely for about an hour but it started getting significantly better pretty quickly, I'm not sure if it was a large amount, probably just a small sip, but it went from continuous bursts to like 2 coughs every 5 or so minutes, I stayed up until about 3, panicked, searching up medical stuff, before eventually passing out because I realized it was a Monday and I had stuff to do in the morning.

When I woke up I was feeling better, but I'm still coughing a decent bit, a good bit more than later last night, but much less than earlier last night.

I have asthma, no symptoms other than a cough, and I know it could just be nothing, (Like the last 6 pinkeye scares I've had), but I get panicked about these kind of things a lot and I'm not sure if I should be worried.

Can somebody please tell me if I'm in the right for being stressed about this or if everything should be fine, I don't know I just feel like I'm crazy and I keep spiraling like this, if this breaks the rules I sincerely apologize because I was a little unclear on if rule 5 specifically referred to anxiety disorders or just in general.",1765939740.0,anxiety
1pol8d6,Make a move or wait it out?,"When timing is off, how to decide when/if it’s wise to give them space while holding onto hope and trying to enjoy what is.

F (50)  M (47)  female here.  met on a dating app.  He said he was looking for friendship, casual, we met for a hike and subsequent outdoor activities in addition to hikes like biking and walks, exploring new places and working out at the gym, also dinner and shopping together.  He is newly divorced (almost a year) and I’ve been divorced for nearly 8 years.  He seems interested, we have shared mutually that we are enjoying each other.  Nothing physical has been introduced yet, aside from hugs.  He offers me his time to help with home projects and we have worked well together, the time flies by and is never boring.  We both have older children, similar ages.  It’s been about 5 months now since we met initially and I have feelings for him beyond just friendship.  I haven’t confessed the feelings, as I’m not sure he’s ready, as he’s still adjusting to his new life as a single divorced dad.  We talk all the time about the adventures to come, trips, hikes, bike trips, etc.  He will mention coming over and helping with X,y, and z…. No definite dates/plans, but I have no reason to think he is anything but sincere.   The problem is I’m conflicted about “making a move” or “giving him the green light” and waiting instead for him to let me know he’s ready.  I read posts that go both ways on this, and I’m not sure if he would make a move or not.  I wish I knew if he was waiting for me to make the move?  I don’t want to seem pushy or desperate.  But when we are apart I ruminate about this question of do I or don’t I…?  He is a great friend and I would not risk the friendship.  But the anxiety is increasing as the days go by.  Especially the longer the time between hearing from him.

1pol83k,Anxiety getting worse with age and it gets harder to find a reliable med without intolerable side effects.,"would deeply appreciate any guidance here. 47M, struggled with anxiety my whole adult life, it has gotten much more severe over time. Decades ago I responded well to Zoloft, or a combo of Wellbutrin & Klonopin. ESPECIALLY Klonopin.

The anxiety kills appetite and sleep, leaves me needing neither, no sense of harm going without. Losing 10+ pounds in a week is not uncommon. It blasts directly through Tylenol PM, Unisom, hydroxyzine, propranolol, Remeron, and Xanax. I tried Buspirone but it gave me a wild heartbeat, even more sleep problems, constant terrible headache, had to bail. Was prescribed Cymbalta but then another Dr said it frequently had sexual side effects, and that's just something I can't risk.

I made the mistake of asking a telehealth Zoom psych nurse practitioner for Klonopin and she talked to me like I was a junkie with track marks up my arm. I also wonder if that is safe for someone well into middle age. So as of now I am on exactly nothing.

Has anyone had luck with an anxiety med with NO sexual side effects and that DOESN'T backfire with sleep? I keep paying $40 to ask telehealth Zoom nurses and they keep not doing anything useful.

1pokmm4,Spontaneous chest thuds and a dry cough. Just anxiety?,"So I've ironically been trying to figure out how to phrase this in my head for the past 2 hours without trying to make myself feel worse, so bare with me.

For about the last week I've had on and off moments where my heart just randomly thudded in my chest, followed by the need to cough and it feeling rather dry.

The thuds have happened very randomly in the past but only once in months or sometimes years and usually it's something more noticeable like overworking when I'm hungry or doing extraneous physical labour.

These ones have been once or twice a minute, then nothing for another 3 or 4 minutes, ad infinitum for an hour or so. They sometimes happen during the day but they've almost always happened at night. They never happen when I'm lying down, only when I'm sitting at my desk or walking around the house.

I've been paranoid it might be a heart problem or an infection, but aunt (a retired nurse) believes it's just anxiety without any real cause behind it. And I saw another post here on this subreddit of other people relaying similar symptoms, which they've now experienced on and off for years to which doctors say it's not serious.

So like...is this just anxiety over literally nothing or should I call 111 / see a GP? I'm paranoid enough as it is without turning into a hypochondriac.",1765937546.0,anxiety

I went to get food one day and just couldnt catch my breathe and could not get any air in and felt like I was having an asthma attack. I had someone call 911 and the paramedics came and said my breathing was okay and wasnt sure what caused the attack they thought it was being exposed to the cold. Im over my sickness and no longer having bad asthma however, im having the worst anxiety. It started when i was driving home from school I was with my friend and just felt a wave of anxiety and a fear I my breathing was going to stop. Since I been home for about 5 days every day im having anxiety related issues with my breathing. I have a deep feeling in my chest and its causing me to think im having issues with my heart or breathing and causing me to have panic attacks. They last about 20min and i feel like I can’t breathe and my heart races. They last about panic dies down however I constantly think about it and check my pulse a lot and focus heavily on my breathing. ive tried many different things to distract myself and try to over come the anxious feelings but im struggling a lot. They only thing i found that some what helps is walking in the cold but other than that im not really sure what to do. I have been having bad sleep because im afraid to go to bed.

Basically it's affected my life so negatively it's been a complete nightmare 

But; on monday I felt a whole lot better, I felt a lot calmer all day, didn't itch & just felt more zen - but then yesterday (tuesday) I was back to feeling my usual crap self again.

What I think gave me my good day monday was; I was so tired on sunday night as I had been hungover, but I dragged myself to the gym to do 60 mins on the stair master, so when I eventually went to sleep... I believe I had a deep good quality sleep which then gave me my good day for monday. 

The problem is; this hardly ever happens, most nights, I go bed really late but usually get 7/8 hours, but I think my problem is my sleep quality is never great (apart from sunday night)

1pojpjg,Changes in routine,"When there is a slight shift in routine for me, I won’t sleep at night over worry because of that said shift in routine. 

So for instance, I decided to work an early morning shift for work on Christmas Eve instead of my normal close. This means more money and a fun Christmas shift. I love my job (barista) and the people I work with. So, when I made this decision, it was based off that. But now, I’ve been losing sleep over this. The last time I picked up a shift, I never went to sleep the night before. I don’t know why. I can tell myself all day long the reasons why it makes sense to have changed shifts and it makes sense during the day. But at night, it’s a different story. When I have the worry at night it seems like I’m just worried that I won’t sleep the night before work because that’s what happened previously. I’m not worried about the actual shift, it’s more of the sleep aspect. 

Has anyone else gone through this? What makes it better? 

I don’t do screens before bed. If I do it’s a light and airy tv show then I start reading or just talk to my partner. I’ve started up chamomile tea again tonight so we will see if that works. It used to. And I think I’ll try journaling too. 

I know I could simply give my shift away and this would all disappear, but that lets anxiety win and I’ll never ever get through this if I keep doing that. I can’t see my therapist before Christmas Eve so I need y’all’s help! Thank you. ",1765934901.0,anxiety

I didn’t ask to be born, for there to be no meaning or purpose at the end, I didn’t ask to see the atrocities in the world happening and knowing there is with no solution, only continuing to get worse when I know there’s good things happening but now in this day of age, realistically most things are negative now then positive, almost everyone is depressed, anxious, suicidal.

I’m in so much pain, I don’t know why this all happens to me when I do my best to be the best person I can be for people. I pray God is real, I know it sounds dumb to think about a never ending life in heaven, but I love my parents so much that even if boredom, I just want them to be there with me after this life of pain. I have everything I need, yet I still feel alone. 

Please pray for me, If there is any God i hope he reaches down and saves me so I can live happily with the time I have with my family and a hope for any form of connection that will feel meaningful so I won’t be alone. ",1765933060.0,anxiety

I went through a really severe depressive episode in October and November. It was the kind where getting out of bed felt impossible, I was crying constantly, and my thoughts were really scary. I’m only just starting to feel a little better.

During that time, I made a financial mistake. I forgot to make a payment after switching phones and disabling autopay earlier, and I didn’t realize until it was too late. As a result, I ended up with a 30 day late payment on my credit report. Objectively I know this happens to people, but emotionally it completely sent me into a spiral.

Ever since, my anxiety has been overwhelming. I can’t stop replaying it in my head or thinking about what it might mean for my future. I feel ashamed, scared, and like I’ve undone all the progress I was starting to make with my mental health. I’ve been crying constantly and having trouble eating, working, or focusing on anything else.

I was raised with a lot of fear around making mistakes, especially financial ones, and this has triggered a really deep sense of panic and hopelessness. It feels like my brain is stuck in a loop and I can’t calm myself down.

I’m not really looking for advice or fixes. I mostly just need reassurance from people who understand anxiety, or to hear from anyone who’s gone through something similar and eventually felt okay again. I doubt i can get it removed so I have to focus on coping.

I've always dealt with anxiety and depression from a young age, but recently after going for four sessions of ECT for the depression and having to stop due to medical issues we were trying to figure out that turned out to possibly be being caused by my psychiatric medication, I've been weaning off that medication (Latuda and Effexor) with the intent to return to my old, trusty Prozac.

The problem is, I'm now having anxiety like I've never experienced in my life, and I'm due in two days to take a five hour flight to see my  aging father with Alzheimer's for Christmas. It is extremely important to me that I see him as he's still in the earlier stages and I want to see him while he's still lucid and can recognize me and enjoy our time together.

The past several days, however, have been hell. I don't even know if they count as anxiety attacks anymore or if they're panic attacks, and I have no idea how to handle them.

An hour ago I started to have one, I was getting the rapid heart rate with what I call the 'body shivers' where my muscles in my chest and sometimes limbs do a weird rapid wave of tensing and untensing, and just felt like I wanted to jump out of my skin.

I've never had anxiety bad or long enough to where I needed to do much to deal with it, but I tried breaking out all I've heard works on this one.

I drank a beer (yes, I know, not ideal), did breathing exercises,  then stood in the freezing cold garage as I was sweating through my clothes, walked in circles for a few minutes, splashed freezing cold water on my face for a few minutes, held ice packs to myself, talked to myself, talked to my mom- etc.

I keep reading that these attacks aren't supposed to last that long but it was well over a half hour and is a little better but still far from gone. In fact, I'm still getting the shivers and (TMI: but just had an upset stomach).

My attacks are not only happening frequently (every day, sometimes several times a day) now, they're lasting quite long.

I finally caved and took one of my .5 Xanax, but I don't want to get too reliant on that, and frankly even that (including taking two for a full 1mg) doesn't seem to be giving me the relief I feel like it should. I've always been so careful with it, I don't want to take it every day.

I’ve been on 100mg of Sertraline for most of the year to treat symptoms of OCD and anxiety and it has been awesome. I have never felt so good mentally.

I took my imposter Sertraline for a week, started to feel truly crazy, so I was able to switch back and immediately felt better for another week.

I know the therapy is going to help, in theory. But it feels like I’m a hopeless cause. I should probably be on meds but I’m terrified to take them because of the freaking health anxiety. Everything feels like a fucking threat and I’m at my wits end. I go to sleep thinking of horrible things. I wake up with nocturnal panic attacks, gasping for breath, the same thoughts that were there when I fell asleep are immediately back. I wake up in the morning shaking, my body feels like it has lead in it and I absolutely dread facing the day. My therapist thinks we can tack on depression as well. 

I feel hopeless. I feel cornered by my mental health. I’m stuck, trapped in my head that feels like a torture chamber. I rarely have a moment where my body feels relaxed and at ease. I guess I’m just shouting into the void here. I feel so alone through it all. Only my partner knows how much I struggle because I’ve learned to mask so well with everyone else. Thank you for reading if you got this far. ",1765930226.0,anxiety
1pohpcp,Drinking anxiety,"Hello my names Kaiden and I’m 19 years old. I’ve had problems with anxiety for a majority of my life with on and off years. Last year I deleveloped generalized anxiety disorder, when I started to have lots of physical symptoms that couldn’t be explained. It was very strange, I would stress about a certain issue and then develop those symptoms. For example my aunt passed away from lung cancer. I was wrestling a couple months later, and then had some breathing troubles, instantly my mind went to I have lung cancer, I had extreme chest discomfort for months due to anxiety, and then my great grandfather got diagnosed with colon cancer, and than again months of symptoms you would have if you had colon cancer, all from just anxiety. I would love to know if anyone had similar experiences. Thankfully this happens every once and awhile and not super frequently. However, recently I started drinking a bit in college, not much but I had the most recently on Tuesday, usually I have some slight vertigo the next day as I’ve dealt with that for years, however, since that day I don’t know if it’s my anxiety, but I’ve been completely out of it cognitively, I feel like I’m zoned out. I don’t quite know how to describe the feeling, but I just want to feel normal again. Has anyone with anxiety experienced similar things after drinking alcohol",1765929358.0,anxiety

1pogzsh,Anxiety about night sweats,"I've had health anxiety for as long as i can remember and have had times where it's been super rough, as well as times where it's been pretty manageable. However, I was doing so well with managing it for a pretty long time actually (I'd say maybe for about a year), but recently l relapsed and began having severe health anxiety again due to me having night sweats seemingly out of no where in which has been going on for a few months now. I’m aware that night sweats can mean something medically serious, which is why I’m spiraling. Basically, my night sweats began in September and have been on going since. They're not drenching, I just wake up pretty sweaty in certain areas a couple nights/mornings a week. When they first started in September, I was only experiencing them in between my breasts (I'm female just to clarify) and on my chest. About 2 weeks ago tho, I began also having them in between my legs, on the back of my legs, on my lower back/top half of my butt, and in the groin area where my inner thighs meet with my groin (in addition to also still having them in the chest area). Again, It's not bad enough to drench my bedsheets, but it does leave my pjs slightly damp in the area where I’ve been sweating. I have a physical on Friday, so I will bring this up with my doctor and i am planning on getting blood work done too, but I fr cannot stop spiraling over this. Just last night, i woke up with sweat on my forehead which is what has really caused me to spiral since now my forehead is getting sweaty. I sleep on my side for anyone wondering

Now, I would like to mention that I do have issues with restrictive eating habits (in which I've dealt with restrictive eating habits since around the time spring of 2024 as that’s when I had developed an ED) so I'm not sure if that could be a potential cause of my night sweats, but regardless, my health anxiety likes to go straight to the worst case scenario and tell me it’s not. Another thing to mention, I have one of those foam mattress toppers put on top of my mattress, in which I had put on there sometime in late august (before the night sweats started). However, I don’t sleep directly on top of the foam mattress topper, as I have a thin sheet and then a comforter put over top of it and then the comforter is what I sleep on, but again, idk if the foam mattress topper could have something to do with the night sweats. I’m only 21 years old but even tho I’m relatively young, I’m still worried sick that I may have cancer or something. I do take birth control and anti depressants at night (i’d say a few hours before bed) which both can cause night sweats, but I’ve taken them for years and they’ve never caused night sweats prior to this so I don’t think it’s them causing it. Lastly, I do have a tendency to eat carb related stuff like cereal a few hours before bed, in which when I eat this type of stuff at night, it always makes me feel jittery, but I feel like if that was the cause of my night sweats, I wouldn’t be waking up in the morning sweaty too sometimes considering that by that point, it’s been a whole 12 hours later since I had last eaten and no longer feel jittery from the sugary carbs I ate the night before",1765927476.0,anxiety

1pogocx,Question for smokers with anxiety.,"Yo. I wanna put it out there that I did smoke vapes for a few months,but quit due to pains in my arms and chest. Overall, I never panicked from the nicotine buzz mostly felt dizzy like im gonna pass out or something but nonetheless felt good. But the entire plan with the vaping thing, was to teach myself how to inhale and properly smoke weed. So when I finally got the chance to smoke weed, I experienced:

1. Pressure in head w/ Pulsing sensations in my temples

2. Shortness of breath

3. Rapid heart rate

4.hearing my own voice in my head.

5.hearing “calming whispers from the other room”

Long story short, went to the hospital and felt completely relaxed until the mental side effects wore off.

My question is tho how likely is this to happen again? Or how can this happen again minus the mental side effects occurring. I felt great when I smoked but I didn’t like the beginning. How can i strengthen my mental health?

1pofrux,Help! weird phases of anxiety/panic,"I’m 6 months into this anxiety hell and I just need to know if this sounds familiar to anyone, because it feels like I’m losing my mind sometimes.

It all started this summer with my first real panic attack – felt like my heart was stopping, couldn’t breathe properly, thought I was dying. Went to the doctor, everything checked out fine physically.

Then the next 4 months were pure torture: constant anxiety symptoms every day. Dizziness, balance issues like I was drunk, mini panic attacks all the time, tingling/prickling everywhere, chest tightness, lump in throat, weird feelings in my legs, derealization where everything felt foggy and unreal. It was exhausting, I barely functioned.

Now the last week or so has been kinda calmer – no big panic attacks, just some leftover dizziness and tingling.

But instead my brain has switched to something way worse: full-on catastrophic and existential thinking. Suddenly everything feels fake sometimes, like nothing is real. Life doesn’t make sense. 

I can’t even think about big questions like “why are we here” or “what if everything we see is fake” without getting immediate intense panic and derealization again. Normal people can ponder that stuff no problem, but for me it’s like touching a hot stove – instant inner terror. It’s like my brain can’t handle any philosophical thoughts anymore without freaking out. Has anyone else had these exact phases?

1.	⁠⁠First big physical panic attack
2.	⁠⁠Months of constant body symptoms and health anxiety
3.	⁠⁠Then when the physical stuff calms down a bit → existential dread, meaninglessness, “nothing is real” thoughts take over 

And most importantly… what usually comes next? Does this phase pass too? Do the scary existential thoughts eventually stop feeling so terrifying and just go away when the anxiety gets lower? Or does it get worse before it gets better?",1765924359.0,anxiety

He also hinted that he doesn’t think my previous instructor should have let me do my previous tests. He said I need more inner confidence to make decisions, that it’s just confidence holding me back. He gave me a talk at the end, telling me to take responsibility, stop asking him if it’s ok to do things.

Now I notice my heartbeat during basic activities like walking, standing up, or doing yard work. I don’t check my pulse, but if I can feel my heart beating hard in my chest, I start to panic and try to stop or relax. It’s really draining, and the only things that distract me are music and gaming.

One thing that gets me particularly nervous is leaving my house to do errands. Work is monotonous enough that it doesn't typically make me anxious to go there, and when I'm going to spend time with friends I also don't really get anxious. However, whenever I have to go to the bank, pick up meds, get gas or get on the highway for any reason, my anxiety levels shoot up and I feel terrified and end up procrastinating and wanting it to be over.

Cut to a month ago, I was eating food and drinking a coke (I rarely drink soda” and after an hour I started having bad stomach and chest pain. Turns out I started getting acid reflux symptoms. After all that a week after I got a panic attack again for the first time in 2 years, then the next week again, now 6 days ago I had one of the worst panic attacks that made my left arm feel weak and scared me so much I couldn’t speak, when I was finally able to I called 911 because it literally felt like I was going to have a stroke or heart attack. The paramedics came and saw nothing wrong with me and said it was just my anxiety. Next d ay I was fine, till my left arm started getting the tingling sensation again and felt weak again, it wasnt as bad and I was able to get it back down, till my mom wanted me to go with her to a restaurant with my cousin, I was enjoying the food but I started getting brain fog, something that happens with me a lot when I’m not in my safe space, so my anxiety started again, so I had to go inside the car by myself so I could catch my breath and calm down, it took crying to get rid of it. Next day I was fine after talking to my mom about it, till the middle of the day when my arms both suddenly felt intense pins and needles, like as if both arms weren’t getting blood flow (just typing it here is giving a bit of worry again). I got it to a manageable state and went into my living room to watch something while I let the anxiety pass, I got up to adjust the couch and I guess I lost my footing because I had to catch my self when going back down on the couch, and when I did I felt a wave of a fuzzy feeling move through the left side of my body, which scared me so much my heart beat sped up a lot to the 110’s, so I called my mom wanting to go to the emergency room out of fear and even called my friend because I wanted to have the people I trust the most with me, I was in the car feeling like I was going to die the whole time while my mom was panicking to find a spot that took my insurance, and the only spots available were hours away, so I told her to just take me to the emergency room, which she did. And my mom and my friend when we got there asked if this was really what I wanted and that it could take hours to be checked out. And they talked me into finally calming down and slowing my heart rate which was near 130 at that time. I felt normal for the rest of the night. Yesterday I wanted my friend to hang out with me, and during it I got the brain fog feeling again, which also gave the pins and needles in my left arm and leg again, it finally went away around 5 during the day and the rest of the day was normal. Now today 3 hours after waking up the fuzzy feeling in my left hand returned, I tried exercising again and it didn’t go away, i called the 988 number just to talk to someone since no one else is available, it helped when talking, but the feeling just won’t go away. My left foot constantly feels as if something is moving underneath it, and my left hand constantly has this fuzzy feeling, which is really noticeable when I rub it against something and let go, it has a lingering fuzzy feeling. I genuinely don’t know what to do because the things I used to distract my mind before aren’t working anymore, these sensations keep making me think something wrong is happening when I know this all started because of that panic attack that made my arm feel weak. I keep telling myself I’m fine and I’m okay but my body just fights back. I don’t want to go back on medication either, I tried weed the other day and it did make me feel relaxed, but I don’t want to rely on it and get addicted to it. I’ve even tried doing exercises every morning and walking more. But the feelings persist and it just makes me want to lay down and cry, I haven’t even eaten yet because I don’t want to move from where I am… I don’t know what to do…

Update: Arm feeling turned into a restless feeling and because I was talking to myself about how I always get light headed when looking up outside, the lightheaded feeling won’t go away

Another update: Tried gaming after a week to help calm down, and it worked for 30 minutes before that pins and needles feeling started showing up in both hands. I got off the game a while ago and now I have the lingering fuzzy feeling plus the pins and needles ",1765915918.0,anxiety

I can’t tell if it’s my wife or the dog lightly snoring beside me in our king-sized bed. I stare at the ceiling and try to clear my head, try to think “good” thoughts.

My ears are ringing. I try to ignore it, but it’s there no matter what. I think I hear something in the house. What could that possibly be, I think to myself. My brain sends signals to my body, making me more alert. Deep down, I know the sound is nothing. My heart rate and awareness rise, then slowly settle back down. I focus on taking deep breaths.

My eyes are heavy. My thoughts are still racing. Is something wrong with me? I turn my attention to a happy memory and ask myself to have good dreams. I crack my toe. I try to crack my knee. It hurts, it’s my ACL-repaired knee..but the pain is comforting.

It’s getting late. I start to worry about not getting enough sleep for tomorrow’s busy day. My mind races again. My eyes are dry. The uneasy feeling is still there.

1pob0da,"I feel like I am constantly being watched, judged, and am unable to perform even the most basic, private actions without paralyzing fear.","I am writing this because I am struggling immensely with what I believe has escalated far beyond normal anxiety. I feel like my life is constantly under surveillance, even when I am alone in my own home. My anxiety makes it impossible for me to perform basic, private acts of life without intense fear and hyper-vigilance.

I experience a complete loss of privacy. I cannot masturbate in the bathroom or in my locked room because my mother is highly invasive. Even though she only walked in on me once, the anticipation that she will catch me is debilitating. Furthermore, I face public paralysis: I cannot look at my phone in public because I constantly imagine people staring, judging, or laughing at me. The very act of visualizing their eyes on me while I use my device is unbearable.

In social interactions, I cannot make eye contact with people, especially service attendants. I struggle to hold my head up or speak without stuttering when talking to them, because I am simultaneously focused on avoiding their gaze and panicking about my performance. This feeling extends to my own home as a constant surveillance. I am consumed by the feeling that someone is observing me constantly. I cannot use my computer if the door is open, nor can I open a bottle of medication or do the slightest act without the overwhelming preoccupation that I am being watched.

The core fear translates into daily, chronic worry about being 'caught' or judged for anything I do, no matter how insignificant. I live in fear of being caught, even when smoking a cigarette on my own balcony. I have the overwhelming sensation that I am sitting 'weird' or that my hair doesn't look right. I feel the need to constantly anticipate someone opening the door so I can hide or put out my cigarette, and I worry intensely that someone will hear the music I'm listening to and judge my taste. This constant anxiety has severely compromised my quality of life, autonomy, and freedom. The fear of external judgment has taken away my ability to simply exist in peace. I am looking for advice or shared experiences from others who have struggled with this level of crippling social anxiety and hyper-vigilance.",1765913028.0,anxiety

1poawjo,"I used to love studying - now, it just scares me.","Hello everyone!

I LOVE what I study at university. I am very passionate and extremely excited to, hopefully, make a living out of what I have been studying. However, I think I am completely losing myself in my studies, to the point where learning no longer brings me joy. The thought of sitting exams makes me horrifyingly anxious, especially after graduating just one point short from perfection. I literally poured my whole life into my thesis… to no avail. 

I haven’t rested from uni for the past year and a half, except for a few weekends here and there and one single week back in June. This semester I have been severely depressed, partially due to my graduation score.

And now, studying gives me anxiety. Class gives me anxiety. Even just leaving home to go to my uni apartment gives me anxiety. I did sit an exam last month - and I got a 19/20. Again, just one point short from perfection. 



I think I have been surrendering too much of my self-worth and sense of self to my studies. When I was in high school, as well as during my first couple of years at uni, I literally did not care one bit about grades. I wanted to gobble all the information up, I wanted to learn. Studying came natural, and my grades were just slightly lower than what they are now. I used to work out, play games, hang out with friends. Now, nothing really brings me enjoyment. I am chronically bored, apart from the uni-related anxiety. 

I do want to find myself again, I want to get better, I want to find my passion again. But anything that is not related to studying feels like a waste of time now. I am in no way behind - and, even if I were, that would be “justified” (not that it needs any justification, it’s just that I am overly critical of myself) due to my living situation and my health. But literally, I feel guilty if I do anything but study. 



Does anyone here have any piece of advice? Or just something kind to say. 

Thank you for listening. ",1765912784.0,anxiety

1poaio8,Health anxienthy and fear of lupus,"I have very weird symptoms Last 7 months .
  


---

In April, I started having strange symptoms after I ate Easter cakes and drank two soft drinks. That evening, I felt nauseous and had abdominal pain, and I became very scared. I started searching online about Type 1 Diabetes and read about its symptoms. After that, I began to shake badly and could barely sleep. While reading the symptoms, I saw that they also included blurred vision, itchy skin, tingling sensations, and frequent urination. The next day, all of these symptoms appeared in me as well. I stayed scared for two weeks, and then on May 1st I had blood tests done, which showed that I had nothing except mild anemia. Suddenly, I felt better.

However, on June 15th, when I was very stressed because I had an important exam, I developed a mild fever of 37.7°C, which dropped over the following days to around 37.6°C. When I was calm, I couldn’t feel it. I also had joint and muscle pain, and my stomach hurt a lot. I started searching online again and came across leukemia, and later lupus, which terrified me. I started looking for a rash and felt like I could see one, and the symptoms started appearing again, even though lupus is more common in females. One weekend after the exam, I went to the swimming pool and felt good, and during that time I didn’t feel any symptoms.

Later, the symptoms started again on August 20th, when I woke up with back pain and immediately thought it must be lupus for sure. I started shaking again and the symptoms returned.

I don’t understand anything anymore because of this health anxiety. Could it really be just that? Please write me some clarifying

At all times there is a voice in my head telling me exactly what I do not want to hear. Unfortunately this has caused me to make several poor decisions that weren’t based on logic just emotion. I do not want to do this anymore I have fallen into a cycle that I have to break from and I definitely can’t do that alone. So I’m looking for advice on how to talk to her about what’s going on. I’ve started having negative thoughts surrounding her being unfaithful at at work which I know 100% isn’t happening for several reasons. But this isn’t the first time I’ve had negative thoughts of this magnitude they don’t always involve her, but they normally do. It’s like I have an intrusive thought, and my brain decides that it’s real to the point to where I almost really do feel like it did happen. My worry is I’ll come off as not trusting her which isn’t true I would trust her with my life. I just need to make sure she knows that it’s not her it’s me and communicate with her what I’m feeling.

I'm incapable of hearing them out, giving support and advice, and going about my day. Even when it's something that I can do literally nothing at all about.

1po5ofj,Gut-Anxiety feedback loop?,"Hi everyone! I feel as though this might be a long rant but I’m so done right now and was wondering if anyone else had experienced anything like this.

To try to start at the beginning around I started to be under some pretty intense stress in January this year, though the actual implications and breakdown of all this didn’t really make itself clear to me until April/May. April-May-June-July were all an intense period of anxiety and panic attacks for me. I couldn’t go to classes without having to stop walking on the way there to catch my breath etc. The anxiety and panic was debilitating and all encompassing, and I genuinely thought I was dying. But at the same time I was functioning and going to my classes and seminars, doing my work and trying to push through it all. I don’t think I truly realised how trapped in a panic, anxiety spiral I was.

At the same time as all these things started to feel off with my gut. I thought it was just that I wasn’t eating well, so I tried to eat my fibre and veg etc. But if anything, that just made things worse. But again, I ignored and pushed through because I had no idea what else to do. TBH I refused to think deeply about these things. I was worried something was seriously wrong with me but I couldn’t and refused to face it. I thought If I got to the summer everything would just get better.

Then it got to summer, and I still had these horrible gut issues where (sorry its TMI) the consistency of my stool was all over the place. I ended up going on holiday with some friends and it felt like torture trying to keep up with other people when my body felt like it wasn’t functioning right. I was eating whatever and I felt so bloated and god damn awful the entire time, and it was so so hot (which I don’t do well with at all). I ended up making excuses to not go on 2 trips to the beach because the idea of being so far from where we were staying and a toilet was scary to me.

But, once I was home things only escalated. Every time I left the house it was all I could think about. My gut issues also became worse because I would now get these seemingly out of nowhere incredibly painful (like I’m about to pass out or throw up, chills, sweating etc) lower left abdominal cramping where my body would feel the need to expel everything in it (again TMI sorry). These episodes were happening once or twice a week, and seemingly only getting more intense. I was supposed to go to Germany this summer I couldn’t bring myself to do it, I went on the train to stay at my sisters and I felt so ill the entire time. It was like my intestines and stomach were on fire (again still eating everything). I felt so seriously unwell and any journey out of the house it was all I could think about, even when I was home it was all I thought about. A constant loop I am still stuck in.

Eventually, I started to cut out foods (basically all food). I went to the doctors – to whom I don’t think I described my experiences well enough – who took my blood and a stool sample and then told me nothing was wrong and it was probably IBS. I’ve also gone to the doctors for my anxiety, done online courses and CBT, been prescribed anti-depressants (which I haven’t taken yet because I’m scared on what effect they’ll have on my body and gut.) They said it could be celiac but that as I haven’t been eating gluten they can’t tell. Since then, I’ve basically been on my own. This was in September. I became so miserable but had to start thinking of how I was going to move back to uni and function. I identified a handful of safe foods I could eat and stuck only to them.

I went back to uni, I have amazing friends who have been very supportive and kind but I still am missing out on so much. I have been gradually trying to expand what I eat but its still only around 10-15 things that I stick to and due to in person lectures and meetings (I’m in my third year), I have just been wanting to be stable. The good news is that since keeping my diet like this I haven’t had any painful episodes, though some weird stool consistency. But, even writing that its been 2.5 months without an episode feels like tempting fate, like im cursing myself. Same with leaving my room/house it’s the constant what ifs. I’ve missed out on my friends, on being around them, ive stopped socialising as much, I only leave my room when I need to because otherwise being outside stresses me out so so much and all I can think of is what ifs.

This is my issue now – I want to eat more foods, and expand, but it scares me so so much. I’m back home for a month for Christmas and my family doesn’t know anything about any of my struggles (we aren’t close and don’t really share this kind of information). I feel so limited. I’m just so terrified of everything, and the fact that I still have no idea what is wrong or what caused any of this is scary. Is it IBS, is it an intolerance, is the way I’m thinking about this ARFID, OCD, anxiety.

In the last few weeks, I have had some rough time medically but also in terms of work/life balance -- taking care of my son (alongside my wife), some gastric issues (SIBO) that I took Rifaximin for 14 days, and generally a ton of stuff to do at work and at home.

It initially stemmed from my previous job and boss, but as I'm in a new job and different point in life, while the anxiety has tapered it still remains. 

About 3 years ago I started medication, which began with SSRIs which were overall s pretty negative experience. After trying a few of them (Lexapro, fluoxetine) I eventually stopped with them, and began Wellbutrin for depression and anxiety. Almost immediately the Wellbutrin improved my depression and has been great since, but the anxiety persisted. Worth noting that when I have gone up on Wellbutrin, the first few days feel amazing and my anxiety all but dissipated, only to return.

I've always been obsessed with traveling, it used to make me feel so free and alive, you know? Jumping on a plane to somewhere new was the best feeling. But over the past year or so, I've developed an anxiety disorder, and suddenly travel has become this huge source of dread, even though I still crave it deep down.

Stuff like airports, landing in a new country, going through border control, or figuring out how to get from the airport to my hotel... things that never bothered me before now trigger full-on panic. The worst part is kinda mourning the old me who could just go without overthinking everything. Oh and I don’t think I can fully enjoy it now since I feel like it's being corrupted by anxiety and just rushing to get back to the hotel, not being spontaneous anymore and experiencing something random…

I'm not ready to give up on it though. I've been trying to build some safety nets to make it more manageable like downloading offline maps, packing little calming things like magnesium supplements, herbal tea bags, lavender essential oil,  always having mobile data ready as soon as I land (I usually preload a cheap eSIM like AloSIM – it's mostly just for the peace of mind of not being totally cut of), giving myself tons of extra time at airports.

Some trips still suck and leave me exhausted from the anxiety, and yeah, I feel a bit embarrassed sometimes that something I love so much now feels this overwhelming.  So, If anyone's dealt with anxiety creeping into traveling how do you handle it and does it eventually go away?",1765891215.0,anxiety

1po0fry,Is it ever difficult for others to balance worrying about a friend and giving them their needed space?,"My standard, years ago, was to give some small amount of support while leaving the door open for communication. 

Then my friend lost her father, and this didn't work. She felt unsupported, and although we are actually closer now, I feel that this was a big failure from me.

From that moment on, I decided that I should apologize if there's a chance them feeling down could be from me and offer to repair the damage, and if it's unrelated to me I should be more explicit with support.

So far, it had worked. When I apologized, even if it was unrelated, I would be told so and I could move on to the second approach.

I know this sounds a bit too systematic, but it isn't really. It's more of a ""I get a feeling that, based on X thing, I should apologize ' or ""I should express open support"".

Now, recently a friend was a bit in a bad mood from me no longer working with them, because it has been a pattern with people they befriend in the workplace. When they showed signs of feeling unwell, I tried to apologize for any part I had played in that, but this time for once the person actually wanted to be left alone.

It certainly didn't help that I panicked and apologized again for that, and such.

I'm not gonna lie, I'm a bit afraid I truly messed up this time and lost a friendship. Or maybe they are just taking their space for now. I'm currently without my anxiety meds and it feels like my thoughts are more disorganized, so I end up doing stupid crap.

- kind of seems to gloss over the deeper stuff I want to talk about. She does acknowledge I have complex trauma. And points out how some things I feel and do are because of that. But once or twice when I wanted to get deeper into that she pivoted back to talking about work (one of my problems too). Not sure if intentional? 

- I mentioned I want to try anxiety meds or antidepressants. I have for a long time now. She said maybe I just want to not feel my feelings and dissociate like I do. I feel like it wasn’t a helpful thing to say? I just want to know what it feels like to not have anxiety for once in my life. 

- she mentioned a client of hers. She said “I have to remind her she’s not a child anymore. She’s an adult!” And in a different conversation “I just have to remind myself I’m a grown woman and I can make my own decisions” perhaps she feels this is empowering but it just makes me go .. okay?

1pnxm7z,Frozen in a prison of constant anxiety.,"I cannot seem to cope with being alive. 

I wake up with a massive anxiety spike and absolute dread every morning. It’s completely overwhelming. 

And then all day I have a very high anxiety and depression. 

This has been the case for many years now and seems to be getting worse with age. I’m 30M

I would describe the feeling as feeling disturbed, doomed, anxious, as if I have just been teleported to a gibberish world. 

I am anxious about everything to be honest, weather have I busy day or day off makes no difference.

I end up completely frozen unable to physically do any tasks at all for hours and hours or make any decisons.

Sometimes things come up I have to deal with like work and I have to use sheer force, but it’s like there’s a gun to the back of my head. Or terrible things are going to happen 

My cope for this is to lie on the sofa and avoid everything, either close my eyes and ignore or doom scroll.

And now I’m stuck in a cycle of anxiety and avoidance , my life isn’t going anywhere and that’s increasing the anxiety 

I’ve lost all direction in my life about what I even want now or what a good life would be it’s just anxiety anxiety anxiety.

I feel like I’m in a ship destined to sink .

Has anyone else ever felt the same and overcome this? I feel completey frozen in fear and lacking any kind of positive to get me out this mess

1pnwq9p,High anxiety and heart rate help,"Sorry for bad English beforehand

Hello everyone, it’s been a while since I posted on this sub

For reference I’m 20M and I’ve been dealing with anxiety for a good 3 years. My main issue with anxiety has been my high heart rate usually in the 100/110s/120s at college or when I’m working

So for the past few months I’ve been doing the most to change my life, I dropped 37/40 pounds (I’m 216 5,6), quit smoking, quit drinking (just ocasionally like once a month I drink), quit doing substances and started doing more exercise and trying to be better to myself 

All of these things definetly have helped me live a better life in the long run but as of pretty recently I’ve been feeling so horrible to the point I wonder if I’m going to suddenly die

Since 3 months ago I’ve been “fasting”, by fasting I mean I don’t really eat during the day or sometimes I don’t eat at all or I eat something that’s ridiculously low calorie for a meal (an apple and a yogurt) and I think my body has been feeling the toll of not eating because my body feels like it’s shaking and I feel really faint sometimes

I seriously don’t know what to do. My pulse could be 100 or 110 when trying to do anything standing up or when I work and it can jump to 120/130 when walking and it makes me feel terribly anxious that’s why I haven’t been able to continue exercising, because my pulse goes to that heart rate and I get so nervous I start having a panic attack 

Also all of this anxiety has been triggering the worse stomach pains and movement where I feel like I’m going to fart at all times of the day, my stomach moves around so much that I don’t even take a shit normally I’m always suffering indigestion

The only thing that calms my mind is that when I’m lying down on my bed completely relaxed and doing breathing exercises before bed my pulse is around 70/85 so I guess I’m not that unhealthy? 

I’d love to get some help :(

1pnwnbn,insomnia with health anxiety,"so i’ve been a regular on this subreddit for the past week basically. starting abt a week ago i started having major panic attacks with heart palpitations, restlessness, chest pain/tightness/tingling etc (pretty much lasting 24/7 until a few days ago my heart calmed down). ive had multiple ecgs since and even a chest x ray with normal results but im still not satisfied because i haven’t done ALL the tests (still haven’t gotten a holter monitor or echocardiogram). its hard to trust that doctors are taking me seriously if they know i have anxiety. thus im always conscious of my heartbeat and can always feel it in my chest even if im just lying there. i was prescribed 1 mg xanax and 0.1 mg clonidine on top of what i was already prescribed (37.5 mg effexor and 20 mg buspar 3x/daily) but im honestly scared to take my new meds because im terrified they will cause my heart to stop. i have a resting HR of around 55 and to me this is scary. ive started to isolate my family with how strongly convicted i am that i have health issues. 

should i just go and get the tests or accept this uncertainty? i’ve seen so many posts/videos online of people with heart abnormalities misdiagnosed with mere anxiety and it TERRIFIES me. i feel like im stuck in an endless loop of fear and paranoia. the only reason im not in the hospital right now is because i don’t want to make my family mad at me. but i dont want to sleep either out of fear my heart will just give out on me, especially combined with the meds im taking. right now im up watching family guy, in line to text with a crisis counselor, just trying to make the night go by faster until i continue my PHP program tomorrow. i just keep checking my pulse. i got out of inpatient a week ago but with this new fear im starting to think i should just go back. it literally feels like my life is a horror movie, im constantly aware of “omens” and impending doom/death and fighting to avoid it. i’ve tried the deep breathing, ive tried trying to “accept” it. what do i do? i’m exhausted and extremely frightened. anyone who has experienced this, what has helped you? doctors advice also greatly appreciated.

1pnwn0l,My advice on where to start with a baseline,"I think its important that everyone with anxiety cuts out common causes for a time, to get a general baseline before trying other things. So these are the changes id suggest to make for one month, to get a baseline:

1. No caffeine of any kind. Some people are extremely sensitive, or it can be a multiplier for anxiety. You can go one month without it to be sure. 

2. No alcohol. Its proven to directly contribute to anxiety. 

3.  No weed. For the same reasons as alcohol

4. 30 min of nature a day, light walking. Its a human and needed thing for me. 

4. No artificial sweets. If you need sugar, have sugar (in moderation).  Anecdotally it can affect gut biome which can exacerbate anxiety. This one is a bit more out there, but worth trying. 

5. Sleep hygiene. Dark room, no phone, and book if you cant sleep yet.  Same wakeup and sleep every day. Including weekends. 

Important note: You might still have anxiety at the end of one month. But starting with cutting out common causes, can give a baseline to work off of. You can rule out these things as a cause if im wrong!  And if your anxiety is much lessened, you can then start to figure out which of these was a cause. ",1765872780.0,anxiety
1pnwf9u,Has anyone’s anxiety gotten much worse since they turned 18?,"I was always an anxious child but I was never that anxious since I was fortunate enough to have a fairly stable family life.

However since I’ve turned 18 it’s almost like a switch has been flipped and now I’m brewing in anxiety almost every day. I’d second guess every decision, worry a ton about whether I’m making the right choice after extensive research, constantly worry about the (exaggerated) consequences this would have for my future. I’m about to graduate from college and just merely thinking about the future terrifies me.

1pnwd3v,FEAR of having a stomach issue in public,"Hello. I really need some help and advice. I am really struggling with stomach anxiety (I don’t even know if that’s what my problem is called). Just to clarify, my stomach does not regularly hurt, it’s all psychological, like I haven’t got ibs or regular stomach cramps, it’s the FEAR of having them when I’m out in public on a bus and not near a toilet and then I have a huge panic attack my whole body shakes and I’m trapped. What triggers this for me is having one bout of stomach cramps in public, like 2 months ago I had stomach cramps pain and gurgling in public and had to run to find a toilet and it was very stressful. Now my fear has completely spiralled. I had gurgling again almost a week ago but after these two incidents I didn’t actually need the toilet it was just gurgling and cramping however now I spend every minute of every day obsessing it will happen again, especially on the bus. I’ve only read about people having actual bad stomachs everyday, not just the fear of it happening. It is so debilitating I’m hardly eating anything I feel so hungry and weak. I’m absolutely terrified getting on the bus but I have to four days a week 40 mins each way. I took some time off last week because I just couldn’t leave the house. I couldn’t even walk to my local shop as I was so scared to have a stomach problem. I didn’t leave the house for almost a week.

1pnw2ti,Anyone here with anxiety have experience with guanfacine XR?,"I’m an adult with anxiety (no ADHD) and looking into guanfacine XR. I’m interested in something that helps calm an overactive nervous system without making me feel flat or overly sedated.

I’ve tried very low-dose clonidine, which actually helped, but I’m curious whether guanfacine XR might be a smoother or more sustainable option long-term.

My biggest concerns are fatigue and motivation. I can manage anxiety reasonably well, but I don’t want something that leaves me wiped out, foggy, or emotionally blunted. Since clonidine helped, I’m especially interested in how guanfacine XR feels by comparison.

For those who’ve taken guanfacine XR:
• Did it help with anxiety or physical tension?
• How bad was the fatigue, and did it improve over time?
• Any impact on focus, motivation, or mood?
• Did XR feel smoother than clonidine or beta blockers?",1765870563.0,anxiety
1pnw140,Does Loud music help anyone?,"I have always loved music. I have had periods of anxiety in my life and occasionally had bouts of depression.

Recently I have been suffering a lot with anxiety, not panic attacks but general feelings of unease due to a sudden end to a relationship that I really thought was going well, plus we had redundancies at work which made me worry. I'm also divorced but still living with the ex and kids until she is ready to sell. I'm financially responsible for the mortgage, bills etc (that's our financial agreement) until we sell.

The recent sudden end of this relationship seemed to cause a ripple effect that pulled away my ""guard rail"" and sparked this period of anxiety. Worrying about my future, will I end up alone, is this it, all that kind of stuff.

This last weekend I visited a friend in another city and we went out to this club. The music system was really good and although I was a bit anxious about going out when I got into the club it was a really nice happy crowd and the music was just incredible. 

My anxiety all but disappeared and I just danced and danced. I found that the loud music vibrating through me calmed me and just carried me with it. I loved the feeling of just being inside the music, it made me feel safe and happy.

My friend told me that she could see I was in my happy place there, she said ""you just looked relieved""

Last year I deleveloped generalized anxiety disorder, when I started to have lots of physical symptoms that couldn’t be explained. It was very strange, I would stress about a certain issue and then develop those symptoms. For example my aunt passed away from lung cancer. I was wrestling a couple months later, and then had some breathing troubles, instantly my mind went to I have lung cancer, I had extreme chest discomfort for months due to anxiety, and then my great grandfather got diagnosed with colon cancer, and than again months of symptoms you would have if you had colon cancer, all from just anxiety. I would love to know if anyone had similar experiences. Thankfully this happens every once and awhile and not super frequently. However, recently I started drinking a bit in college, not much but I had the most recently on Tuesday, usually I have some slight vertigo the next day as I’ve dealt with that for years, however, since that day I don’t know if it’s my anxiety, but I’ve been completely out of it cognitively, I feel like I’m zoned out.

1pnukn6,Sleepless nights caused by False Vacuum Decay theory,"I recently went down a rabbit hole on human consciousness, and just how conscious works, and ever since then I have been experiencing anxiety attacks and sleepless nights once or twice every couple of weeks. I have become horrified by the idea of losing my conscious experience, and never experiencing anything every again.

What’s been on my mind lately is a theory I remember hearing about a while ago called false vacuum decay. The theory is that, randomly, at any point in the universe, a bubble could form and expand outwards at the speed of light. Inside the bubble, all of physics essentially becomes rewritten, and there’s literally no way to predict if a bubble is coming our way.

Now what scares me about this is that we have no idea if there is a bubble near, and if one does arrive then we don’t just die, we get erased. Instantly. There is no pain, there is no suffering, there’s no nothing. And honestly I feel like just having the constant stream of experience suddenly stop rather than slowly fade away in front of my eyes is much more terrifying.

I’ve done some research on the topic and learned that the chances of a bubble forming are so astronomically small that we may as well just consider it zero. The chances of one forming are something around 1 in 10^100 which I can clearly see and acknowledge is unfathomably small. Despite this, my brain is not satisfied with any number greater than zero.

I know that I’m way more likely to die from lightning, or a car crash, or from literally anything else. But I feel like literally everything else is somewhat within my control. I can kinda control whether I get into a car crash or not, I can kinda control if I get struck by lightning, but I can’t control whether a bubble of vacuum decay is about to arrive at earth in a few seconds.

Has anybody ever dealt with this kind of anxiety before? Or does anybody know how to cope with this? It’s gotten bad lately and I’m looking into therapy because of it. I’m even thinking that I might want to try getting prescribed Xanax or something like that because these attacks last for a long time, are extremely distressing, and don’t really seem like they have a good way of being handled as opposed to PTSD, depression, etc.",1765865017.0,anxiety

1pnu39y,Fear Of Death,"I know that this gets posted about very often. But I honestly cannot cope with the idea of death. I’m 20, and every night since I was 16 I have been kept up by this fear.

And how do I even describe this feeling? Because yes, I’m terrified of dying. Nothing is scarier to me than the fact that I am conscious and aware that everything I do in this life leads to nothing in the end. But the biggest, scariest part of dying to me is that I know I’m going to die alone. I know I’m going to die alone, in the dark. 

When I think about dying in the middle of the day, like at work or school or just socializing, it doesn’t scare me. I figure if I were to die in that moment, I would be okay. But at night, when I’m alone, in the dark, I am so afraid of dying. 

I fear growing old, and I fear being even more afraid and aware of death than I am now. I look at these older people that come into my job, that seem content in their ways and not afraid, and I imagine myself at their age. I think I’m going to spend my entire life living in fear, and it’s going to get worse and worse the older I get.

1pnqs7p,Health OCD/Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

I’m in my 30s, and my health OCD and panic disorder are absolutely spiraling. I’m constantly scanning my body for every little sensation, convinced something is horribly wrong, even when logic says it’s normal. The intrusive thoughts are relentless, and panic attacks hit hard multiple times a day.

I’ve been on paroxetine 60mg for 6 years, but it’s completely pooped out. I’m planning on tapering off while cross-tapering to fluoxetine (hoping for a fresh response), also on low-dose buspirone 5mg twice a day, and using alprazolam 0.5 at night. I just want something that actually quiets the health obsessions and stops the constant panic.

I’ve been on a few different anxiety meds (lexapro, venlafaxine, fluoxetine) to no avail and am currently on sertraline (Zoloft). For panic attacks I currently take Hydroxyzine for the past few years as needed. I recently started w a new therapist who said the hydros were kind of a silly approach for panic attacks and suggested talking to my dr about trying Clonazepam. I was curious if anyone has been on them and saw positive results or had any negative side effects. Everything I’ve read online says it’s pretty darn addictive and that makes me quite nervous.

1pnqic9,Worried About Getting Proper Help From Psychiatrist (for Autism),"There's some context to this from my previous post. Mainly with the issues I've had in the past few years and what lead up to this. Also has info about my previous job experiences: \\\[\[Click Here for Some Context\](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1p14x15/need\_helpcomfort\_parents\_set\_up\_a\_psychiatrist/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button)\\\]



However, I don't wanna type too much on here since most would be a repeat of the previous post. So I'm just gonna do a tl;dr thing.



\*\*\\\[tl;dr\\\]\*\* Called the receptionist to the psychiatrist place. Gonna see someone in late Jan (aka in a month or so). However, I asked about if the one I'm seeing, or any of the other doctors at the place, were knowledgably or experts on autism. Appairently, NONE of them are. I have no clue what the heck that means. The receptionist just said ""we treat everyone"" and when I tried bringing this up to my dad, he just simply wanted to get on the phone and explain to the receptionist ALL about why I'm visiting and the issues I've been having.



This has made me concerned about whether I will get the proper help I need. ESPECIALLY if involving medications.



I want to get help from someone who is knowledgeable about autism/neurodivergence and how medications/therapy/methods effect those with it.  

\*\*\\\[tl;dr ends\\\]\*\*



I am open to trying out certain medications that can help with anxiety, rumination/perseveration, executive function issues (e.g. autism inertia), etc. I am also open to medications that could help me work on commissions/art without ruminating/worrying about the ""quality"".



My dad, who goes to the same psychiatrist place, REALLY wants me to go there. The medication he's on now, that his psychiatrist gave him, have been helping a lot. I can attest since he's been doing a lot of yard work during the summer and generally seems happier. He's very satisfied with his current medication. He claims that the doctors at the psychiatric place try to get together to discuss what they've learned from helping out certain patients. I imagine they've definitely helped out others who are neurodivergent. So I know he's hoping I'll be able to somehow get better.



I'm trying not to let some of the negatives stories from other reddit post get to me. (e.g. psychiatrist who doesn't understand autism or is rude or invalidates you) I understand that they're just some people's personal accounts of visits going wrong. I forgot who said this but it went something like (paraphrasing) ""\*Most often, people who've had positive/good experiences with \\\[something\\\] often don't make post about how well it went\*""



I could try contacting the place again to ask more specific questions, if needed. But I wasn't sure if I should just wait until the appointment to ask. I just don't want to risk waiting for a month only to find out the psychiatrist wasn't a good fit and risk upsetting my dad.



Honestly, I just need some reassurance about all this.",1765852317.0,anxiety

1pnptbm,16M with Anxiety,"Hello 👋 I’m a teenager in high school and I have anxiety (and I think I have ADD but I don’t want to sound pick-me and say I have a plethora of other neurological disorders).

I first started seeing severe symptoms when I was somewhere between 8 or 9 years old, or from what I can remember at least. I’m not sure entirely how anxiety happens, but I think it had something to do with my dad and his anger issues in my early childhood that left a really big impression (I remember more negatives than positives).

I always got terrified when anyone has something negative to say about me, or if they’re mad at me. I typically overthink almost everything I do, and profusely apologize for even the smallest mistakes- this led to some people- including my s/o- not valuing my apologies as much as I’d hope for them to, which really upsets me.

I’ve always wondered if medication was the right path for me to take. Once my parents experienced my first anxiety attack which resulted in my screaming and needing to be restrained by my father, they took me to therapy. I didn’t say a word to my therapist, not that I resented her in any way, I just couldn’t bring myself to open up to a stranger. I’ve tried many ways of overcoming my anxiety, but it seems to fluctuate and has even been getting worse over the years to the point where I’m crying in my closet over trivial problems.

More on my s/o- she keeps trying to offer me advice but I feel helpless. I try to explain to her what I feel when I’m having an attack, but I never seem to really get the point across. My best explanation to her would probably be :

“Imagine being forced to picture every possible outcome of every action you make. Filter out everything positive and you’re left with the negative consequences. Now, you have to live out every single scenario simultaneously while dealing with real life at the same time.”

I don’t know if this is accurate for any others in the subreddit but this is accurate to me.

I guess this is more a venting/advice post if anything. How do I manage my anxiety without shutting myself out from the rest of the world?

1pnpdux,Doing too well to ask for help,"I don't even know how to explain this. I've had this feeling for a while, for years maybe, and I'm in my  early 20s so that's a bit weird. I have a bachelor's degree in psychology and am finishing masters now. I have a best friend, a boyfriend, I don't need to work to pay for college. I have good grades, I don't let myself fail at anything. I'm not social by any means but it feels like self sabotage because I can hold a conversation if I need to. 

Which leads to the reason of this post. With all of this how am I ever supposed to get help. I've felt anxious my whole life and I can't remember the last time I was genuinely interested in a hobbie and didn't just quit. I can't remember the last time I slept well for a full week. I believe I often go through periods of depressive symptoms, but it never continues or gets too serious. The anxiety is always there though, it's almost weird when I have one peaceful week, but then it's back and it's worse.

I've done worse. I've hurt myself much harder than I do now, but also I hadn't done it in years and now I'm doing it again and it feels weird. The pain of it helps, but it's weird. Why does it always feel like I'm doing it on purpose? Even when I was 13 and parents or teachers asked me if I was okay I liked feeling like shit and hurting myself, but secretly I cried myself to sleep  every night trying to seem like a antisocial, edgy teen. I'm well past that, thank GOD, but I can't stop that way of thinking.

I can't ask for help. Not even just for this, for anything, I hate feeling worthless. What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't feel anything as intense as anxiety and I know how diagnosis work, I know how therapy works. It feels like I'd have to do it all myself anyway. I told my family doctor I wasn't feeling super well and she said nothing stopped me from going through a psychotherapy process and it was like. Yes? But her telling me that didnt make me go look for it. I don't know why I expected something more impactful, to feel something more.

Is this normal for other people with mental issues? I feel like no one ever talks about the self awareness of it. How excruciating this is, knowing every wrong ur doing and not being able to stop. I know I need help, I might get it one day, but this will probably never stop since it's been my whole life.

1pnp9dm,Is this a Panic/Anxiety attack?,"Three weeks ago, I got very sick and threw up 5 times. Since then, I have had daily battles with what people are saying is panic attacks. To give context, I will have a pain in the back of my head, not great eye sight at times, and a quick flash that makes me feel like I can’t talk.

1pno0m2,Im scared of carrots?,"Basically, for about 5-7 years ive been avoiding nearly most vegetables, before that i was eating them normally amd liked them, idk what the cause is but at some point if you tried to feed me carrots, lettuce, or most other vegetables i would refuse completely, this still continues to this day, but its concerning to me

Today after dinner i went to my bed (i have a shared room with my sister), she came later than me, i saw her eating a raw carrot during dinner thats why iw anyed to leave asap, when she got up she had already another carrot, and she was eating it, i asked her if she could not eat it but she refused which ig is reasonable? For the whole time she was eating it i felt like i wanted to cry, the sound of the crunch and that smell(?) were litteraly killing me
(Note, tbh i dont think i have the sense of smell, but i sometimes can feel smells that aint even there)

After she finished the carrot i couldnt help but feel as if the room was ""contaminated"", i now dont want to step near her side of the room, and dont want to touch her bed, every spot that is likely to be touched before she washed her hands is now also ""infected"" to me, to exit the room i try opening it using the part of the handle which is often not touched (or i think it is not), i wiped the light switch for the bathroom 3 times with soap because its small and she definitely touched it, idk how i feel about the floor, i think it is dirty too, yes to me all that the carrot may have touched is dirty

Am i goin insane?

The kitchen is always a war zone for me, everytime i touch a counter/open the airfryer i wash my hands with soap, if i open the fridge i open it from a spot where i never seen anyone open it from, when i open a drawer or similar i touch the ends of the handles, and ofc, wash my hands straight after, this happens to the most random things even some sauce bottles, when i walk ont eh kitchen floor i try to barely make any steps and look at the floor all the time

You could say ""just clean it then if ur scared of it!?"" But how can i clean something which other people think is just nothing? Litteraly, i bet no one ever thought that vegetables leave dirt...

At first i used to think its about the texture of the food, and i just didint like eating it, but then i realised its obviously the look and the feel, my 3 most hated things are carrots, lettuce, and broccoli, while carrot and lettuce leave everything that touch them ""infected"", the broccoli is a litteral nightmare, the green dots get everywhere and if i see any i want to throw up instantly because they can be anywhere even in my clothes already

Its litteraly impossible for me to live in this house without feeling like everything is contaminated because realistically who washes their hands everytime they touch a... carrot..?

 I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life. I had what I would call a nervous breakdown in 2019 I fell very sick for no reason and didn’t eat for a week. During this time ( which I didn’t know) I started to withdraw from marijuana, caffeine, and sugar. That sent me into a huge spiral of depression to the point of anxiety about everything around me I didn’t trust myself for months was having crippling anxiety and depression. so on. I then went to the doctor which then didn’t ask about any diet changes or major events so on. She just put me on Zoloft. I hated it I was a zombie. Truly wanted to not exist and felt emotionless… I took myself off of those. 

I dove into Reddit and found vitamins. I was taking zinc, bcomplex, potassium, vitamin D, magnesium glycinate, fish oils, biotin, NAC, vitamin C, and L theanine. That was what I did for months as I suffered. Eventually things got better but it was a dark time. I then two years later went through a difference I left my wife because I was very unhappy. I regret it a lot to this day because of my children and realizing a lot of things. But that led to 4 years of heavy drinking and late nights and women and just being reckless.

1pnm3b5,I feel like I never work enough. Is 50-60 hours a week sustainable or is this my anxiety talking?,"I’m 27, married, and working full-time in a lab role. Over the past few months I’ve been working a lot of overtime — initially it was occasional, but it’s slowly crept into being my norm. I’m hourly and we get paid double time so it helps a lot. 

What started as 6:00am–3:30pm turned into 5:00am–3:30pm, and now it’s usually 5:00am–4:30pm. I’m consistently hitting 50–60 hours a week, and mentally I feel like anything less than that “isn’t enough.”

Here’s the issue: Even when I do work those long hours, I still feel behind and anxious. If I ever leave early or have a slower day, I immediately spiral and worry that overtime will dry up, that I won’t be making enough money, and that I’m failing as a provider.

I have some minor debt, student loans starting soon, and my wife and I want to buy a house and have kids in the next few years. I feel like I have to grind at this age to be prepared — but I’m also realizing that my baseline for “enough” keeps moving upward, and I don’t know where it stops.

Logically, I know 40 hours is full-time and 50 hours is already a lot. Emotionally, it doesn’t feel that way at all. I’ve also been diagnosed with anxiety/OCD, which probably isn’t helping.

So I’m looking for perspective from people who’ve been there: 

Is 50 hours a week actually a heavy workload long-term? 

How do you prepare financially for big life milestones without living in constant grind mode?

1pnlx8s,I don't understand my diagnosis,"Hey! I am seeing a psychiatrist regularly and I am on medication for depression (my main complaint). She diagnosed me with GAD and I came here because I'm honestly confused. Is it possible to have anxiety and not feel anxious at all? I don't think I constantly worry about things, let alone multiple things, and I don't think worry or anxiety stops me from living my life. I don't have physical anxiety symptoms either. I've only gotten panic attacks as a result of bad reactions to medication, and I don't get stuff like constantly being tense or feeling short of breath or like my heart is racing or anything of that sort.

I'm just trying to understand what anxiety feels like and if maybe I might just be unaware of it or something like that. I've just always thought anxiety is one of those things I would notice having, I guess, so the diagnosis is really difficult for me to accept and I don't really relate to what I do know or have seen so far in trying to find information about it. Is it possible to have anxiety and be entirely unaware, to have it without worrying about anything in the first place? If so, what are things you have tried to help you be able to better identify your anxiety?",1765839871.0,anxiety

1pnj2rw,Where to draw the line between pushing myself and overdoing it,"For a bit of context, I had severe childhood OCD and I’ve had anxiety almost my entire life but up until this year I’d been doing very well for around 2 years. I suspect I may have some kind of other neurodivergence that plays a part in my social anxiety. 

I started a new job 5 months ago in an office/wfh after experience workplace bullying in my previous role (retail duty manager). I love my new job however the adjustment from managing stores to an office environment has been tricky. It takes me a long time to feel comfortable around people and I’ve found the office quite overwhelming at times. We hot desk so I rarely get to sit with my direct team and I’ve struggled to form bonds with people. But in the last month I’ve felt a lot more settled within my direct team and some new people have started too which has been nice. 

However, I have this horrible crippling fear around socialising with people I don’t know very well. I find it really draining and confusing as if everyone is reading from a rule book that I was never given. I feel like I’m trying to perform some version of myself and I can’t relax at all. I overthink and overanalyse everything and end up saying nothing. Last week, we had our team Christmas lunch and I was very overstimulated by the level of noise, multiple conversations going on and trying to keep up with everything. Now, this Wednesday we have my worst nightmare planned in. We have a team breakfast with the wider team, then a lunch with the two smaller teams, then our Christmas party for the business area we work in AND an after party at a bar. I didn’t RSVP to the after party because I didn’t realise it was separate from the Christmas party (I was purposefully not looking at my calendar more more than a week ahead because I knew I’d start panicking). Everyone else is excited as it will practically be a work-free day but I feel sick with stress at the idea of having to ‘perform’ for a whole day when I’d rather just be at my laptop. 

This is more socialising with strangers than I usually do in a year nevermind in one day. If it was just the one event I would push through as I know I need to make an effort to be closer with people so I don’t feel as lonely and sometimes social events will be more enjoyable than I expected and I’ll be glad I pushed my comfort zone. But three events in one day is incredibly overwhelming for me and I’ve been worrying about it nonstop this past weekend. I grind my teeth in my sleep (I have to wear a mouth guard due to this, thanks anxiety) and everyday atm I am waking up with jaw pain from clenching. 

I’m scared that Tuesday night I will start freaking out and I will wake up Wednesday morning mid-panic attack (this has happened to me before). I could be honest with my boss (she is aware I have anxiety but we’ve never discussed it) but I find it so hard to open up about it, even to people I’m close with. I would rather just say I have the flu (it’s going round at the moment) than have to get into it. But I feel bad for making excuses and not trying. But then I also know this is probably too much in one day. So I really don’t know.

I really enjoy what I do, it’s easily the best job I’ve ever had in almost every aspect… and the fear of losing this due to my anxiety is compounding it into the stratosphere.

The complication lies in my agoraphobia, which was under control until about a month and a half ago. It has taken me from an outstanding worker and turned me into someone who can’t meet the basic requirements of my position. I am required to be able to drive around the city to different locations, however being stuck in traffic is a nightmare scenario for me. I’m also required to monitor specific locations during rush hour, for up to four hours at a time, this is also extremely difficult for me because I feel trapped (a big trigger for agoraphobes in general). 

I took a two week leave of absence, got a therapist, and tried to be proactive, but obviously I wasn’t cured after two sessions. I’m still in therapy and will see that through regardless, but I’ve just finished my first day back at work and I was not able to be where I needed to.

I’ve scheduled a sit down with my bosses tomorrow, and I’m genuinely terrified that they won’t be able to or willing to accommodate my current situation.

Este 2025 sin duda ha sido muy duro. Mi abuela se fue para siempre, he pasado por una depresión bastante fuerte, algo que nunca pensaba que me podría pasar a mi, he dejado atrás la tienda y es como volver a empezar en los negocios, tenemos que dejar la casa. Guau! Ha sido intenso eh

Pero todo tiene una cara b, bueno, casi todo.. He aprendido muchísimo. Que hay que disfrutar de la vida, ser fiel contigo mismo, darle importancia solo a lo que realmente la tiene. Tengo la sensación de este año haberme conocido a mi mismo después de todo ese tiempo que llevaba perdido sin saber ya quien era. He hecho muchísima introspección, y me he reafirmando en que soy una persona increíble, positiva, luchadora, que siempre tira para delante sin importar lo que venga. He aprendido a confiar, a ir sin prisa, a enfocarme en el presente, sin dejar atras mi plan, todo lo que quiero hacer, pero ahora lo veo de otra forma, no es sufrir por querer llegar rápido a la vida que quiero, sino saber a donde vas, trabajar en ello y confiar, es tener más disciplina, hacer lo que tengo que hacer cuando tengo que hacerlo, tener orden, estar en paz, sin dejar de hacer todo lo que te hace feliz.

Te gusta escalar, escala, ahora tienes ganas de padel, hazlo, quieres irte de escapadas con el coche camperizado, vete, quieres viajar más, viaja. 

Disfruta de y con la gente que quieres. 

Y esque este año, como todos en realidad, no puedo estar más agradecido con los amigos que tengo y que han llegado . Creo que no hace falta explicar mucho más, pero si decir que volvemos a hacer un montón de cosas y planes de los que nos gustan.



Considero que hasta ahora, todos los cambios que he hecho en la vida me han llevado a algo mejor, así que no me queda más que confiar, de hecho tengo la certeza de que esta nueva etapa que empieza ahora va a ser increíble. 

En el fondo siempre he sabido quién y cómo quiero ser, pero ahora lo veo más claro, y voy a hacer por ser esa persona, por ser yo mismo.

1pndx6q,Missing out on sleep due to anxiety,"This might be a little long but for context I’ve always dealt with anxiety since I could remember. I think my earliest memory of getting treatment i was about 5 years old and had just started school. I’m now 20 and still struggle with things but with multiple ups and downs i’ve come across some great management skills and push through a whole lot more year by year. 

There is just one thing I’ve realised only recently that’s really messing up my schedules and just day-to-day life. My Sleep. 
I’ve always had issues with sleeping (such as insomnia) but over the last few years i’ve really developed some scarier thoughts during the night regarding my safety. I am just so anxious that someone is watching my everyday routine from my back garden (my bedroom faces the back) or alternatively my house is going to get swarmed and broken into via the back. Any little noise and i’m so hyper aware of everything. 

Some honourable things to mention: 

- Lived in this house my whole life (parents house) and only ever had one issue regarding my fears and they were quite minor. Some man was just going through cars and rubbish bins and another time police had used our side gate to catch someone jumping from fence to fence. 

- Terrified of the police helicopters and they hover almost every night in my area and surrounding. Sometimes it’s car chases (i once asked back at school) or apparently just overall surveillance. it only makes my fears grow that someone is hiding in my area or more specifically my backyard. 

- While it was never confirmed, an old neighbour that has since moved away, claimed that there was a “roof walker” that would climb on everyone’s roofs and get by from tree to tree. She was a little odd but she was certain of it. However, our area has a lot of possums and the one time we were suspicious my dad went out and it was just a HUGE possum on our roof. 

- These feelings have only developed since i was around 16 or 17 so the last four or so years. in this time, i unfortunately went through a few traumatic assaults. 

- i am constantly hearing things. Foot steps, rattling, thuds, breathing or anything that could raise my alarm bells. 

- I do live in a little bit of a dodgy area and home break ins have been a lot more frequent on the news lately.

the last thing to mention is that earlier on in the year i was left alone for the first time ever. my whole family were out of state apart from my older sister who doesn’t live with me anymore. During one of these nights, i fell asleep A LOT earlier than usual maybe around 11pm. I then woke up super super super distressed and anxious. I was convinced there was a man in my backyard by the door. I saw him. I heard the thud and then i saw him. i texted my sister multiple times but she was fast asleep as by this point it would’ve been around 2am. When she didn’t answer, I was calling my mum shaking and borderline hyperventilating. No one was answering me and I gave up and called 000 Australia’s emergency line. They obviously did very well and I managed to walk to the front end of my house as for some reason i felt more secure there. Maybe an hour later the police called me on a private number just to ask some general questions and they then ended it by saying they’ll just do a quick look down the street with their bright lights and they were BRIGHT. Now that it’s been over 8 months since then, I could probably admit that I don’t think there actually was anyone there, but i was soooo convinced for an extended amount of time that there was. 

I don’t sleep until the sun comes up and It’s due to my anxiety. I can’t get ahold of stable professional help as I simply can’t afford it long term. I’ve been meaning to get ahold of a psychiatrist for my adhd, maybe it could be worth looking into some sleep medication or something? I just want advice, techniques, some reassurance (?) 
I’m not even sure if this is the right place to come and i do apologies if it’s not. it’s currently 4:46AM and i’m just so anxious.

**Till Grade 4 -**

One of the most charismatic person in school.  
Was elected for being a president without even participating.  
Favourite students of almost all the teachers.  
Everyone in the whole school knew me.  
Almost every girl (seniors as well as juniors) have crush on me.  
Every boy wanted me in their friends' group.  
Excellent in academic as well as athletic

(Once I scratched the hand of one of my classmate due to anger, blood was coming out of his whole hand. Suspension was sure - but I was left with a warning and the whole school was with me - saying it's impossible for me to do such act even though I myself was admitting I have did it).

**Grade 5 and Grade 6 -**  
Downfall -

1. Downgrade in academics (but not that much, I was still a ranker (Rank 5)).
2. Lost each and every status due to change of school.
3. Was shadowed.
4. Lost athletic skills

Rise in different area (not in school)-  
One of the best swimmer in the whole district. Was elected to represent in the state. A good waterpolo player as well - clubs were fighting over to take me (Represented state and played several region level tournaments).

**Grade 7,8,9 -**  
Further downfall -

1. Left swimming and waterpolo.
2. Left academics as well (was faking - so expert in cheating that I was still holding rank 5).
3. No school friends.
4. Lost academic skills, athletic skills completely, swimming skills completely, waterpolo skills completely.

Rise in different area (again) -

1. Best supporter in a battle royale game.
2. Made many friends (at my peak, I was having 220 friends and more than 40 were very closely connected)
3. Was in the celebrity status where everyone wants to play with me.

**Grade 10 -**  
Downfall

1. Academic skills were still on downfall but was becoming so expert in cheating that I was still holding the rank.
2. Lost gaming skills (as the game was banned)
3. Lost all the online friends.

Rise -  
I had 1 best of best benchmate who used to talk with me.  
4 best friends who were so good (that they even deny to eat tiffin without me)  
2 other best friend - Supporting in every scenarios and helping with everything - class tests, assignments and what not.

**Grade 11 and 12 -**  
A complete downfall -

1. Lost everyone - no offline as well as online friends.
2. Complete lost of academic skills.
3. Mental breakdown - extreme procrastination, attention disorder, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts (took tests - and were having alarming score in everything)

Rise -

1. No rise anywhere.

Current phase (end of grade 12 and school) -

1. As I have faked my whole academic scenario, I will be surely exposed in a month (I have a competitive examination in a month and cheating there is impossible).
2. Is not able to do anything due to extreme procrastination and loneliness. Meditation and other exercises are not working. Reward based system is not working due to anhedonia.
3. A complete mental breakdown - Now, I am so desperate to talk to anyone  (not desperate to talk but be called a best friend by someone)
4. Suicidal thoughts because I will get exposed in a month (it's impossible for me to cover 2 years syllabus in 1 month) and I am yet not able to start due to above stated reasons. (I am literally reaching out random people on discord and reddit - just to talk with them and make them friends). I am so desperate to join a friend group.

(Not exactly suicidal thoughts- but the thought of leaving everything behind and just escape in the Himalayas - which is practically impossible)

**A problem with the environment or the problem with self? -**  
The problem is not with environment, but with myself.

1. I have so many people to call friends and I have cousins and my own brother too - but no one whom I can share everything with and s/he shares everything with me.
2. Tough to understand and accept that people are self interested and selfish and pre-assuming everyone to be complete selfless and altruist. (which is hurting me a lot when I am not receiving a help from anyone when I need them the most)
3. Have I not met kind people? I have did and there are people who are emotionally helping me out as well. But the problem is - they are not thinking me as friend - they just message me when I message them - they don't share anything about themselves and just specifically helping me out with my problem only (There is a no difference between talking with them and talking with Gemini 3 pro).

Extreme affects due to loneliness and watching of so many movies and anime -  
I am so desperate to join a friend group and have an (extreme) altruist good looking girlfriend (who is with me in every moment). I don't deserve that type of partner - because I myself is 4/10 at max and is mentally unstable.

Am I the only one suffering through this? - No (I have talked with many people and they are going through the exact same as me)  
But am I the only one who is getting affected the most? - Yes.

Sorry for such a long message and rant (just wanted to say someone - but I have no one to say to).

From 60+ messages per day to becoming so desperate to talk to someone - the downfall is so great - that a whole diary can be written on it.",1765820423.0,anxiety

I have really high anxiety, I force myself to quit or steer away from things in fear of not being good enough to do it, failure, humiliation, embaressment, etc. I am also kind of scared of interacting with people because my mind has this thought that they are for some reason looking down on me, dont like me or try to humiliate and ridicule me, sometimes I feel like they might hurt me.

1pndf1j,Where Does Cleanliness End and OCD Begin?,"Hi everyone,

I have a question that comes from deep within me: Where is the line between logical cleanliness and obsessive-compulsive washing/cleaning?



In my home, my mother—who is the primary rule-maker—lives with diagnoses of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). The combination of these three has made her a legislator with good intentions, but sometimes without a clear awareness of healthy boundaries.



I am aware of her obsessions and their impact on me. However, I have doubts about cleaning/washing OCD. How can you tell if a behavior is part of a disorder?



For clarity, here are some examples of the rules in our house:

・Washing fruits, eggs, and food packaging.

・Washing all newly purchased clothes before wearing them.

・Disinfecting new phones and books with alcohol.

・Transferring purchased pastries to a home container.

・Placing outside documents (like mail or files) in a dedicated cabinet and washing hands after each touch.

・Showering after using a public restroom or after wearing clothes for shopping.

(It's worth noting: due to alcohol damaging devices and respiratory issues I've recently developed, I sometimes reduce these rituals out of my mother's sight.)



For years, I thought this level of cleanliness was the standard everywhere. But now, after seeing my friends' lifestyles, I've noticed a stark difference. Almost all of them believe that cleaning OCD rules our home.



Why is this question vital to me?

The household rules probably won't change.But as an individual, I need to know—for my own peace of mind—which behaviors are rooted in logic and which are rooted in anxiety. This self-awareness is the key to gaining control over my own thoughts and worries.



I feel this contradiction:

In others' homes, I try to act like they do, but inside I'm full of bad feelings, guilt, and an incomplete sense of enjoyment. I maintain my interactions, but you know... it's a bit hard. I pretend everything is normal. I go along with everyone everywhere and do everything, but only I know that I'm wearing a mask to pretend that nothing is wrong.



Perhaps the problem lies with me. Even if others aren't ultimately that clean, the issue is mine for not feeling comfortable at the ""normal"" level of society. Perhaps the problem is mine for becoming a hindrance when others want to enjoy themselves in the dirtiest of places.

In the end, I don't know what the standard is.

Who defines what is normal and abnormal?

I need to reach an understanding so I can begin to take mental control—this search is essential for my own self-awareness.

I have just one question for you:

In your opinion, what is the criterion for diagnosing washing/cleaning OCD? Where do you draw the line?

Please share any thought, experience, or perspective you have—big or small. Even if you don't have a definitive answer, just share your personal take on where this invisible line is.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post.",1765819802.0,anxiety
1pndcnd,Scared of a paradoxical reaction,"So I was prescribed 5mg of Valium for some extractions I’m gonna get done soon, very happy to be getting these extractions btw, but I have quite a bit of anxiety when it comes to medications. Even the numbing shot, I’ve heard it has epinephrine in it so since then I’ve been terrified of the numbing shot but yk, not terrified enough to not get the shot. I also get extremely restless and anxious when I have to sit still. 

I’ve had Xanax, calm reaction. I’ve had Valium while in the hospital by IV, felt sillier than a goose and I believe I’ve had Ativan once as well. I’ve tolerated benzos well, but every single time beforehand I get this major paranoia and anxiety that it’ll somehow make my anxiety worse. Or calm me so much that I die.

I think this stems from when I was 16 I took a BUNCH of Zoloft in an attempt to no longer be here and was put in the hospital where my HR went almost up to 200 and I had some sort of seizure (this is when I was given the Valium through IV) ever since I’ve been terrified of medication. 

As well as, marijuana gives me horrible panic attacks and when I was much younger laughing gas made me start screaming and freaking out. Also, I finally tried Prozac after doing some work on my anxiety and trying to get over my medication fear and I’ve never experienced such HORRIFIC panic attacks like I did while taking Prozac. It set my medication anxiety all the way back.

And too, I like control and for whatever reason the thought of not having anxiety, since it’s something I have every single day, sounds so foreign and strange that it’s scary. It’s like I *want* the option to feel anxious. But not like drug amplified anxiety, just my regular ol anxiety that I know how to deal with. Does that make sense? I feel like if a drug causes the anxiety I won’t be able to calm it and then ofc, yk, die (as my anxiety tells me)",1765819648.0,anxiety
1pnd2lw,Fear of developing MCAS due to long covid,"What the title says. My intrusive heath thoughts have totally stopped me from eating and I think I’m on the cusp of ARFID.

1pnbkdh,Why does resting feel like failure,"I took a day off because I’m burned out. I knew I needed it. I was exhausted, overwhelmed and running on fumes. And yet I spent the entire day feeling guilty for not being productive.

I didn’t actually relax. Every time I tried to rest there was this background noise in my head telling me I was wasting time, falling behind or being lazy. Even doing nothing felt like I was doing something wrong.

I even tried to distract myself for a bit with something low effort and enjoyable like playing jackpot city and still couldn’t shake the feeling that I should be doing something “useful.”

That’s the part that scares me. Burnout is clearly eating at me but rest somehow feels morally wrong like I have to earn it or justify it. I can recognize that I need a break and still can’t let myself take one without self criticism.

1pnbexb,Anyone had success with therapy alone without meds?,"For context, I am 26F. I've had anxiety as long as I can remember. I had my first legit panic attack when I was 13.

When I was about 18, I tried medication for the first time. It was citalopram. But I got so in my head about it that it literally made me sick and feel worse. So I stopped taking it after a week or so. So I probably didn't even give it enough time to work.

The second time I tried medication wasn't until years later. More recently, I was probably 24 or 25, and it was buspirone. And again, I didn't take it long enough to work because I got nervous about it. I've just never been a big fan of medication. I get scared that it's going to change my whole personality or alter my brain in a way that I don't like.

But my mental health is getting to a really bad point where it's affecting my marriage. So I'm considering trying meds again.

I've tried therapy in the past, but it was more so couples counseling. I did have a few sessions with just me, but it just gets awkward when I don't know what to say, and we're both just sitting there quietly. So I just don't want to go through the whole process of trying to find a therapist that's right for me.

I'm more keen to the idea of taking medication to fix everything. I know it's not a quick fix and it takes time to work through your system.

I’ve tried everything to calm it down exercise, therapy and I’ve also undergone countless medical tests, all of which have come back normal. I’ve been evaluated by neurologists, ENT specialists, internists, and gastroenterologists.**

When I lie down in bed, everything starts to pulsate: my head, my legs. If I place my hand on any part of my body, I feel tingling and a very strong pulse.**

1pn9rgp,Always on edge and nowhere to reset,"I am not really sure how to start this, but I have been holding all of this in for a long time and I need to let it out somewhere.

I am someone who genuinely does not have bad intentions toward people. I am very naive, I trust easily, and I often do not realize when people are judging me or manipulating me until it is already done. Because of that, I keep getting misunderstood. People assume things about me that are not true, and instead of talking to me directly, they slowly start avoiding me or distancing themselves.

What makes it worse is that this happens everywhere I exist.

At college, I constantly feel judged and on edge, like I have to watch every word I say and every action I take. At home, it is not much different. There is pressure, misunderstanding, and a feeling that I am never fully understood. These are the only two environments in my life. I do not have friends, and I do not have even one person I truly trust or feel safe opening up to. There is no place where I can relax and just be myself.

Because of this, I feel like I am stuck in fight or flight mode all the time. My mind is always alert, tense, and braced for something to go wrong. Sometimes it honestly feels like I am a nocturnal animal, like a rat or a mouse, where being out in the open during the day just means getting pounced on.

I am treated the same at college, that stress follows me home and same happens there. Things are same at home, I go to college drained and anxious, the same happens. It feels like a deadlock that never really breaks.

The only time I feel some kind of peace is late at night, usually past midnight, when everything gets quiet and dark. There are no expectations, no conversations, no judgment. It is just silence, and my mind finally slows down. Sometimes that scares me, because it feels like the only time I actually exist.

Over time, this has affected me a lot. I think hundred times about what I say or do, doubt myself and get gaslighted by my existence and feel like I have to shrink or stay quiet just to avoid problems. I feel lonely even when I am surrounded by people, I am just emotionally and mentally tired.

What hurts the most is knowing that I never intent to hurt anyone, yet being treated like I did. This keeps happening both at home and at college, I am starting feeling like something is wrong with me, can't express in words.

I just do not know how to survive when being kind and naive keeps backfiring, and there is no one to fall back on when things are always overwhelming and the same.

I just took my first ever dose of Propanolol about 4 hours ago and for the past 30 minutes I’ve noticed a really strange side effect. I put on some music and it sounds lower pitched than normal! I tried out some other songs and they were the same. It’s like they’re all 2/3 pitches lower than they should be and everything is off key.

Has anybody else ever experienced this? If so, did it ever pass? I want to stick with the Propanolol as I’m taking it for two different reasons. But gosh, it’s making me panic. 

To note, I also have a slight headache on the right side of my head and I’m feeling panicked.

1pn8x2u,"I thought I was healed from anxiety, but I guess not","Trigger warning: Mentions of panic attacks and unhealed trauma. Graphic description.



I have been suffering from low-intensity anxiety since high school (just didn't realize it). I used to chew through pens and break off pencils in the middle of class. I just thought it was something I did (quirky am I right?)

  
Since I'm out of school, I thought my anxiety was gone. It's been 4 years since I felt anything close to the symptoms of anxiety. I was talking confidently to people, and if I messed up, then I played games to forget about it. And it worked.

  
Today, my father comes up to me and asks me if I want to go shopping. Immediately I feel all my life foundations cracking apart. I have had a distant relationship with my father my whole life where I never saw him more than a couple of days every year. All our conversations ended with me storming out to stop myself from lashing out. Every conversation starts about how I had so much potential, but I did not live up to it. 

  
But today, I felt it again after a long long time. A panic attack coming in. All I could do was decline my father's request, run to my room, lock my doors and try to calm down. My whole body felt like I was breaking out in hives. I kept scratching and scratching at my arms and face and neck and legs, but the itching wouldn't stop. My hands were shaking and my vision was blurry. It was all I could do before I felt it going away. By the time I was done, my whole body was covered in red streak marks.

  
Just when I thought I had healed from any lingering trauma, one sentence brings it all crashing back down again. I am fine now, but just wanted to share my experience.",1765809429.0,anxiety

1pn8uuf,I had a horrible day at the job today,"So I'm starting my second job and today I was there to sign a contract. But I was very anxious and confused. Employer asked me my home address and I said that I don't remember exactly the flat number. Then I remembered ans told her. She said that I look very scared and tense and wether I'm always like this or I'm nervous because I'm just starting this job. I said that I'll get used to it but her pointing out at this made me feel a lot more anxious and tense. Whole time I tried to calm myself down but I couldn't. I just wanted to leave the building as fast as I could. I was so confused and my body language gave me up. I thought that she saw all the things that I was struggling with. I could tell that she was disappointed. Maybe she regret hiring me. Last year I had a very painful experience in a workplace. Basically I was harassed for 4 months and it was a training. After that course was finished I should have gone to the interview but they didn't let me and I still don't know the reason why. I was bullied my colleagues too. It was supposed to be my second job, I was student that time and it made me feel very insecure. After that I became very anxious about working especially I'm anxious with an employer. Yes, I'm a translator and I have a job right now too and I'm pretty fine with it. But with my new job I feel very anxious. It's a great place and salary is very good. Which kinda makes me feel like I'm not good enough for it. Also that employer woman she's amazing but there's something about her that makes me very nervous. She's tall and well-educated. I don't know but some people make me feel very anxious. I don't want to disappoint her or my parents. I don't want to lose another job. I'm just very anxious and I don't know what to do.

1pn8stm,"Should I go to an outpatient facility? If so, how can I get there the quickest?","I feel like I am being held at g\*npoint 24/7. I wake up everyday and have tears in my eyes instantly from overwhelm. I will wake up multiple times a night as if an alarm is going off, feeling like I need to do something right then. I constantly replay every situation in my head over and over, my thoughts are an amalgamation of every single time I made a mistake, or people weren't kind to me. Genuinely, EVERY. WAKING. SECOND. It is making me an intensely negative person, and if I am not negative then I am completely flat. It causes me to not be able to experience any pleasure at all. I have no mental reward system, and barely relief when I finish tasks. My body acts as if I am in a hostage situation, and I am constantly fidgeting, shaking, and my heart rate is always high. I can't even watch TV, or scroll mindlessly. If I am not thinking of the negativity loop, I am thinking of being desperate for help, and how to get any. I don't want to be held in involuntary, but my need is so urgent that if I had to in order to get urgent help, I would. Keep in mind that I am otherwise a healthy person- I exercise, eat regularly, and have a purpose in life. 

  
I genuinely don't know where to start. I am 21, so I just aged out of my pediatricians. I usually don't have this anxiety, but there was a trigger for it. This has happened in the past, but it took about a year to improve from that trigger. This might take longer, honestly the symptoms are much worse. Besides the anxiety, I have issues with executive functioning- like I'm on a beta version of autopilot. I forget my ID or keys multiple times a day, I am so plagued by overthinking that I will pay for gas and drive off without pumping the gas. I will panic about things being lost when they are right in front of me, and I will forget my train conversation midway, and space in front of people. I cannot do work, I will sit in front of my laptop for hours and It takes me hours to read for classes. I am in finals week and I just want to be home, but I cannot just sit in this for any longer. My pediatrician's clinical psychologist suggest that I go to the hospital for an outpatient referral, so that all my problems, especially the anxiety, can have intensive treatment. I am worried that I have so many problems that they aren't going to find the actual diagnosis or treatment right away, and I am so incredibly desperate to get it right. I can't live like this anymore. 

  
I was thinking of using my campus's psychiatric services, but I'm worried they are booking so far out. My new PCP suggested L-Theanine (which I already take) and 5- HTP. I feel almost insulted to be prescribed supplements. The resident physician suggested Xanax or something of the like, but I didn't want something that I can develop a dependence on, as Benzos are addictive, and I can't be on them forever. 



I need access to a therapist, and psychiatrist team right now, because I am feeling mentally tortured. The problem is I don't want to lie and say I'm a risk just yet, but I see potential to being a risk if this isn't treated soon. My PCPs psychiatrist is booking 6 months out. We found an outpatient facility closer to where I live (8 hours from school), and my pediatric psychologist is happy to give me a referral. Does anyone have experience with psych outpatient? Was the intensive care something helpful, and did they help you find a long-term solution? Does this sound right for me?",1765809130.0,anxiety

1pn7qrd,Every day feels unbearable since my panic attack,"About three weeks ago, I had a really bad panic attack that landed me in the ER because I genuinely felt like I was dying. My heart was racing, I felt weak, dizzy, and completely out of control. I ended up going back to the ER multiple times over the next 3–4 days because I couldn’t shake the fear that something was seriously wrong.

Since then, the physical symptoms just haven’t gone away. I constantly feel weak in my arms, overly aware of my heartbeat, and stuck in this fear that I’m about to have a heart attack. Even when I check my vitals and they’re normal, the sensations feel so real that it’s hard to believe I’m actually okay.

I’ve tried everything people suggest:  accepting the sensations, meditation, breathing exercises, and distracting myself, but my body just won’t calm down. It’s exhausting to live like this every day and still have to function like a normal person. The hardest part is fighting the urge to go back to the ER because logically I know they’ll tell me I’m fine and send me home, but emotionally it feels unbearable.

I guess I’m just looking for reassurance that I’m not alone in this, or that someone else has gone through something similar and actually came out the other side. Right now it feels endless and really scary.",1765806400.0,anxiety

For context also his dad passed away about two years ago and it got worse after that happened but the whole summer it was really bad for him. We thought it was him not being able to get a job because of all of this we thought it was the heat, but it really wasn’t that. He had tried multiple medication’s to the point where his doctor had to give him Ambien because of how much she would wake up in his sleep. The only thing that helped him was waking up me or my brother who is a minor to help him through it. I’m not great with other people’s emotions. I’m autistic so I can’t really help much in that department but my brother does it better than I do and he keeps waking him up whenever it gets bad.

1pn5kfi,What can I do to stop feeling this way and get things done?,"[Also posted on r/mentalhealth. Reposted here because this problem hasn't stopped yet and I think it has more to do with my anxiety rather than my depression, but I could be wrong. Please direct me to another subreddit if you think so.]

I'm quite new to reddit, so I apologize in advance if the post could feel kinda messy. It's the first time I've felt the need to ask strangers online what to do.

I'm young, almost an adult, and I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for a year now, with therapy, treatment and everything. The problem I'm starting to face more frequently and intensely is that my mind shuts down when I need to do something. No matter if it's work, school work, a hobby, self-care, etc. It has gotten to the point where I cannot get things done for the life of me and instead waste time thinking, which results in me doubting my will to go on. I keep having no idea why that is. I'm not the type of person to vent and talk about these things to my friends. My best is to lightly joke about them, but that's it. I also tend to isolate myself when these kinds of episodes happen, so that's one more complication.

I'm sure, or at least I hope, I'm not the only one who has to deal with these types of struggles. Whenever I tried to look for solutions, the most common answer I've found is to start doing what needs to be done and motivation will come along, but that has stopped working for me. That's why I resorted to asking myself directly.

1pn26zf,Last year fundamentally changed me and I don't know how to deal with it.,"2024 was probably the worst year of my life and I feel like I have come away with it with a lot of trauma. I had 5 deaths in my family, starting on Jan 1st 2024. Close extended family, immediate family with my Aunt in law, and finally rounding out the year with losing my grandmother who I was very close to. 
On top of that I lost my dog out of no where in an extremely traumatic and sudden way, and we had to put a family cat down a few weeks later.

I've seen a lot of death in my life, but last year felt like a reaping and I know it wasn't just for me but for a lot of people. I feel like I have PTSD from it that I don't know how to deal with. I'm constantly anxious that someone else I love is going to die. I worry about my pets if they sleep too soundly they won't wake up. Or that my parents will suffer something in their sleep, or a freak accident happening to anyone. It keeps me up at night and my usual coping mechanisms don't seem to work anymore and I can't break the thoughts.

1pn1svp,Going through a rough patch,"I've been suffering from anxiety and mild depression for a few years now. I was diagnosed in 2018 and I've had my ups and downs. I've had therapy, CBT, but never meds. Two years ago I've had a shit year work wise that messed me up. Last year was better and this year I feel like crap again. I have these pitfalls that are signs that I'm slipping again and I was ticking all the boxes. I was tired, overworked and overwhelmed, joyless, unmotivated and generally not taking great care of myself. I thought: in December work will slow down a bit, I will take better care of myself and meet up with friends and see my doctor because I'm afraid I'm depressed again.
And then last week I had a nasty fall and broke my shoulder in three places. I'm a bit of an invalid now and moved in with my parents because I can't even feed myself, or get dressed or take a shower. I now have doctor's appointments and X-rays and physical therapy and my anxiety is through the roof every time. I stay inside the house because I'm scared to fall again. The first day after the fall I almost passed out and now I'm very scared of this happening in public and hurting myself again. 
I've been to the supermarket and the hardware store with my dad to get me out of the house and my anxiety has never been this bad. I'm having PT in an hour and my body is in flight or fight mode and I haven't slept a wink. 
I'm thinking of seeing my doctor. Waiting lists for therapy are very long but maybe there are other solutions. But I don't have any privacy at the moment and I'm ashamed of feeling all these things. 
I just needed to vent. I will probably feel better as soon as I can use my arm a bit. 
I'm also self employed and I won't be able to work for several months. I have money set aside but it still sucks. Work was always my escape from anxiety and my feelings and now I can't work.

I know starting medication is a very personal choice, but wanted to seek some advice from people with lived experience rather than just professional perspectives.

I generally worry and ruminate a lot after I’ve said something, for example in work meetings. In those situations, the physical symptoms really kick in and while I try my best to confront it by still raising my hands in meetings, it doesn’t feel nice at all. The same thing happens with driving. I also worry so much about how others see me and engage in post event rumination. I also worry about very random things - worry about my pets, health anxiety, etc. i also severely bite my nails, probs another symptom of anxiety that has now become a habit. I think the main impact is that a lot of my time is spent worrying, makes me feel less confident at my job even though I know I’m good at it, and not enjoy things as much. Sorry this is a bit of a ramble and might not make much sense.

I know it’s related to my sense of confidence as well, my early experience - I am aware about the psychological stuff as I’m also currently in therapy.

1pn0vuv,First Time Experience with Room Spinning and Nausea,"Hey everyone

I'm not sure if this is the right place, but after some quick Google searches, I ended up here. Last night I had the scariest experience ever: I went to sleep normally, but woke up twice feeling like the entire world was spinning violently around me. I felt extremely nauseous and dizzy, it was absolutely horrible, and it's the first time this has ever happened to me.

Both times it was triggered by changing positions in bed:

* First, I was sleeping on my back, rolled onto my side, and suddenly everything started spinning intensely.
* I managed to fall back asleep, but when I rolled from my side back onto my back, it happened again—even worse this time.

The second time, I got up, washed my face with cold water, but the dizziness never fully went away. Now I'm sitting here terrified to even try going back to sleep because I'm afraid it'll happen again.

Has anyone experienced something like this? Any idea what could have caused it? Is there anything I can do at home to make it stop, or any over-the-counter medication that might help with the spinning and nausea, without having to see a doctor right away?

1pn0ny5,The Trauma it Leaves,"25F here; have lived with anxiety for as long as I remember. A high functioning adult, considered smart an overachiever by peers, yet I knew somewhere that I was slowly falling apart. A few months ago, right in the middle of my PhD, after having a brief breakdown, I literally collapsed. Trembles, high sensitivity to light and noises, insomnia, gut went hell, nausea like it would k!ll me by vomiting, panic attacks one after another, derealization-depersonalization, what wasn't there; and I was all alone abroad, so afraid that I didn't let anybody know, with zero support network. Thinking about it makes me tear up. I never knew it could all be anxiety. I went to multiple doctors; proctologist, gastroenterologist, GPs, cardiologist; all results coming out clean whilst I felt like dying every night. I messed everything up, started skipping my lab 'cause I literally wasn't in physical condition to go, yet I couldn't explain to my faculty; cause what would I tell them when I didn't even know what was happening to me? Then I started beating myself up for missing lab and failing life, messing everything up, adding fear to my fear, skipping meals, going malnourished, inviting depression to my mind and body. Writing this makes me all tear up. 

Then like a ray of hope, I bumped onto Claire Weekes' books. Could it be anxiety? I went to a psychiatrist immediately. Got prescribed SSRI long term and Xanax as a rescue medication. Things slowly started to change since then. Practicing self-compassion, DARE by Barry Mcdonagh, Acceptance and Commitment therapy, gradual exercise and socializing along with medication; things started to slowly get better. After 4 months now, as I'm stable enough but missed my precious PhD time, I'm just incredibly sad. I process emotions better now, thanks to therapy and socializing. I enter meltdowns every now and then though they pass away quickly as I don't resist them. I felt like I'd die and none would know. And now I'm filled with nothing but guilt. I'm trying to recover, even proposed to someone I fell in love with though got rejected; still, I never even allowed emotion, less, love and vulnerability to enter my body. I'm recovering. But incredibly sad. The trauma is there 'cause somewhere my body believes whether I enter that state another time I'm really gonna d!e.

I'm trying to return to daily life, slowly. I'll likely return to lab soon. But don't know what awaits me in future. Perhaps this sounds like victim talks, but thanks for reading. ",1765780521.0,anxiety
1pn0n5m,Working in news with death anxiety has been harder than I thought,"Need advice - I’m a reporter for a digital paper (former MMJ). I thought digital would be better and I’m fully remote, which is a huge plus, and I get health care again (haven’t had for a bit). They want us to put out 7 stories a day (granted, they can be shorter stories) and reach about 400-500k page views a month. The issue is that if there isn’t a lot of breaking news, crime, crashes, etc., then I don’t have as much to put out and will have to write longer features and interview folks (which I love, but are time consuming and can’t do 5 in a day). 

I had a horrible story in one of my towns in my coverage area recently and it bumped my page views up. It’s such an unsettling feeling knowing my job is secure and my boss is happy because of this? I know breaking news, crime etc is what gets page views, but I hate living like this every day wondering if I’ll hit my page view and then having this disgusting feeling after realizing I’m set for the month after a tragedy.  

Does it get better? I started working here recently. I know it’s a bit different than being a MMJ, but I would take being an MMJ over this. I would rather have 1-2 stories to focus on and dive into for the day than 5-7 throughout the day spreading me thin. I have pretty bad anxiety outside of work and feel that stepping back into news may not have been the right decision. I know it’s almost like exposure therapy or becoming desensitized, but I don’t know anymore. I’m scared if I leave, this will impact future jobs as I’ve only been here a short time. I didn’t realize how much breaking news and horrible stories it would be daily. I’ve declined going to cover stories at funerals because I don’t feel comfortable doing that.

I went from being an MMJ to features writer for a paper to now reporter of all stories for a digital site. I enjoyed features so much, and that’s what I want to do. I just fear if I leave now after a short time, it will negatively impact future opportunities in features at a different paper/company. 

I haven’t been able to go to the gym, cook regularly, clean, do any hobbies, etc. because I’m mentally drained and consumed by this new job. I am thankful it’s remote as I’m also trying to plan a wedding, but feel as though everything is too overwhelming right now and the holidays and wedding planning has been darkened by this new job and the decline of my mental state. I can’t seem to get into a good routine or good habits to break out of this headspace. I wake up and first thing I do is look at the press releases of crashes etc and put out a story in 15-30 min or I’ll be reprimanded that it wasn’t put up fast enough, and if I don’t have any breaking news, still reprimanded even though every other type of story is longer to research, find, write etc! 

My entire feed on FB, social media etc is all things happening in my area (for pitching stories), but so much more horrible news lately and I know that’s the life of a reporter, but when I was working in features, it felt lighter and more manageable. 

I truly love talking with people, hearing and sharing their stories, but I don’t get to do this as much (a few times a week if that and I’m always so happy when I get to, but then I don’t even end up writing the stories until a week later when I find time or on a weekend).

I’m convinced it’s the dairy causing the anxiety because after I go to the bathroom, anxiety symptoms start resolving. 

My doctor says give it a month of no dairy and try reintroducing it to my diet afterwards little at a time to see if it resolves itself but alas it’s been well over a month and it’s still happening.

I wouldn’t say it’s debilitating but honestly it’s been making me really depressed to think I’ll never be able to enjoy ice cream or pizza now without experiencing full blown anxiety (feeling hot and sweaty, mind racing, trouble concentrating, feeling like something’s wrong, brain fog, trouble remembering things). 

My question is:

1) anyone else experience anxiety with lactose intolerance? 

2) do you think it’s normal for me to suddenly develop this kind of response to lactose after years of simple diarrhea? ",1765774924.0,anxiety
1pmyqgm,Absolutely horrible hypochondria,"When I shower/use the bathroom I avoid ever looking down and look straight ahead completely frozen to avoid looking at my body. When I lie down on my side I put a very thick layer of blanket underneath to prevent the possibility of feeling something abnormal against my abdomen when laying on the mattress. When I feel itchy, I avoid scratching it or scratch it with a large brush to avoid feeling something (like a lump) when touching it. When I feel a pain anywhere on my body I cry and start thinking of the cancerous tumor that’s probably multiplying and dividing rapidly in the area that’s causing the pain. Whenever I make a spelling or grammatical error I think about how there’s probably a brain tumor in my head that’s pushing on the area that controls cognitive function and thinking. And over the past month I’ve, at least 15 times, mistaken a normal body part (like bones, muscle, fat, tendon etc) for being a cancerous lump when it really was just a normal anatomical feature. 



It’s just getting so bad. I’ve always had health anxiety but this is the worst it’s ever been. With this I also have a horrible fear of going to the doctor and avoid it at all costs. Honestly the idea of going to the doctor for me is the equivalent amount of fear that someone would feel with a grenade being thrown into their room. It’s just so hard to get past the idea of receiving bad news. And to make matters worse, my mom dismisses all my health fears and laughs at me when I mention them to her :(",1765773883.0,anxiety

1pmy5s9,Extreme anxiety/spiraling about making new friends,"Hi Reddit. I'm not sure if this post will gain much attention, but I'm hoping that maybe just typing it up and getting it out of my brain might help me think straight. If I wind up getting some helpful comments or advice on it then that will be a plus.

A little bit about me. I'm a 32 year old woman. I'm a massive introvert; I've been single my whole life and the idea of putting myself out there to meet new people has always been a terrifying venture. I'm always by myself, and while I appreciate my independence I do struggle with loneliness. I've struggled with anxiety my whole life, possible undiagnosed autism although that's a discussion for a different day. I feel as if I have a better handle on my anxiety symptoms as an adult however I still find it managing to make simple things difficult. Lately at my job I've been working together with someone from a different department. We've been working on a project together and I've really enjoyed working with and getting to know this person. We've had several great conversations and I feel like we have quite a few things in common. I work in steel fabrication in a small rural town and it's not often I find a coworker who I click with. Now the simple answer to this is ""Well if you want to be friends with this person just talk to them more!"" And I agree, but that's where I begin to spiral. I overthink EVERYTHING. Simple things I want to say can't seem to make it out of my mouth without me tripping on my words. Whenever I see him walking around at work even the idea of just speaking up and saying hi makes me so nervous. What if he doesn't want to talk to me? What if all of these feelings of potential friendship are completely one sided and he couldn't care less? Do I have a crush on this person simply because he's been nice to me and I'm that emotionally starved?

He's been incredibly generous by taking time out of his day and offering to help me learn some new skills that would potentially advance me in my career. With Christmas coming up I baked some treats and figured I'd bring him some as a thank you gift for all his help. Totally harmless right? So why am I second guessing myself. What if he doesn't want them (which would be fine some people don't like sweets). What if he's just being nice and doesn't want anything to do with me? Am I coming on too strong/awkward?

1pmxyex,Helpful words or tips?,"Hello, I am 18 f , and have been experiencing the worst anxiety attacks of my life recently. 

This all started about a month ago after having a bad experience at a musical festival out of town where I had to be rushed home after day one. I had felt my head go cold , lost all feeling in my legs, couldn’t breathe, throwing up, vision blacking in and out, twitching etc…and thought I was honestly experiencing a heart attack, I had begged to be rushed to the hospital, but luckily was able to calm down a bit once I got into my friends bed and drank some water. 

Ever since that night I have been dissociating all day and experiencing anxiety attacks every night around 5pm-12am. 

I have experienced similar attacks in the past and have been ruled out for any medical related issues , and have even have been on Zoloft for about 4-5 years now , but it honestly hasn’t helped even with my doses being bumped up since becoming an adult. Even so, those attacks came and went, whereas these just keep coming back every day.

I started a second part time job last week , and it’s honestly been making things harder since I’ve been working so late into the night.

I would just like to ask if anyone has experienced anything similar, and what they have done to cope with it? What medications have helped you? I’m just so lost, I come on here every night reading posts , but still feel dazed. I feel like a robot every day and just want to feel normal again.

1pmxaue,Positive post,"Just wanted to share some positive news on here and spread hope on this subreddit. I feel like I’m finally getting better. I have been able to go out with friends and family more, have normal interactions more, etc. I feel like I can finally hold off on the anxiety and just sit with it and not let it control me. I can push past that anxiety that’s telling me it’s safer to stay home and not go out. Obviously, I’m not 100 percent and I will still have some really hard days, but I don’t know if I’ll ever truly be back to my old self. I don’t see an issue with that either. Some positives have come from my anxiety. I quit drinking, I stopped taking those small moments with friends and family for granted and it made me appreciate my health and situation I have in life.

1pmwvmj,How do you deal with a narcissist?,"To make a long story short, my father has been is textbook narcissist basically his whole life and it’s been something that my Mom, sister, and I have had to live with for many years. My sister no longer lives here (he kicked her out because she didn’t go to nursing school). He’s never really been physically abusive (for the most part) but he’s been a severe mental manipulator and abuser. 

The current situation is that he’s angry and giving everyone the silent treatment because it snowed yesterday and my mom said she should go to the store before it gets too bad and he flipped out and of course brought up some other things he decided were bothering him. Now we’re in the stage of the silent treatment for probably around a week until he decides he’s no longer angry and will pretend nothing happened. 

I have severely bad anxiety probably due to growing up in a household where we would walk on eggshells constantly and frequently be given the silent treatment for basically no reason. 

I really just don’t know what to do, I wish I didn’t have to live like this but as of right now I just have to stick it out and deal with it. We try to enjoy the times where he’s actually somewhat nice but that’s usually like 75% of the time. It used to be much worse where it would be probably 30% nice but it’s still absolutely miserable. 

It’s so frustrating that you can’t even communicate with him like a normal person, he will just get angry if you contest anything that is right in his mind. He’s truthfully nothing more than a cowardly, disgusting, piece of shit of a human. I can’t even say that I feel any love for my own father, I don’t hate him but he’s ruined any kind of love that I had for him when he didn’t speak to me for 10+ years and we lived in the same house.

1pmwmh3,Has anxiety ruined love for me?,"Hi, does anyone else feel like their anxiety has potentially ruined their chances of finding love? I ask because anxiety can be so debilitating. There was a time when I felt so scared to do anything that I barely wanted to leave the house at all. Thankfully, I’m doing much better now than I was back then, but anxiety still affects me at times. Every now and then I’ll have small panic attacks, especially when I feel really uncomfortable or pushed far outside my comfort zone.

One thing that constantly worries me is how my anxiety might affect a relationship. I struggle with things like planes or boats because feeling trapped and far from home really scares me. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would want to be with me if my anxiety ends up holding us back in life. I live in the UK, and since it’s not a huge country, a lot of people want to travel abroad—and because I can’t really do that, I feel like I’d just be limiting someone else’s life.

I don’t know… it often feels like I’ll never find someone who’s okay with being with me as I am, anxiety and all. I do want to get help and work through my fears, but anxiety is such a horrible, frightening feeling that facing it feels overwhelming. 

 I feel I could maybe do a boat and be comforted just by being with the girl I love and that would atleast give us parts of Europe to check out. But I definitely couldn't do a plane.. idk I just feel so lonely but feel like there's just no hope that someone would love a guy like me.. I'm so tired..  I want to be loved so bad but feel so trapped and held back by my anxiety.. I'm 26 and still have never had a real in person relationship..

1pmvgv2,I don’t know what to do..,"It feels like my whole life has been building toward this overwhelming fear about my health. My aunt on my mother's side had breast cancer in her early 50s, and l've carried that worry for years. I started menstruating at 8 years old, wasn't breastfed, and grew up on unhealthy milk, unhealthy food, junk fast processed foods, and no real nutrition until I turned 25. l've lived more than a decade since 15 years old under extreme stress, anxiety and depression; barely sleeping 4-5 hours. I've been exposed to heavy air pollution from constant motorcycle driving, and my body has felt inflamed and worn out for so long. Then everything got worse - I was diagnosed with Lungs Bilateral TB with cavitation, nodules, and lifelong Bronchiectasis... Then I did Breast Surgery to remove benign nodules/fibroadenomas. Plus in just within this 5 months (June-December) I went through three Chest X-rays, three High-Resolution CT Scans that medically speaking increase more chance of having cancer in the next 5-10 years. And now I feel like all these risks are stacking up against me. I'm terrified that all of this means I'm heading toward cancer in the next few years, and the fear is so intense that it feels like my future is slipping away from me. That it's MY FAULT because I failed to take care of myself. The guilt. That once cancer came, it is all because of me… And now I will face all of my life choices and consequences.

Fast forward to know and my health anxiety has gotten so much through a blood test I did recently where I found out my levels weren’t quite normal.

I sat down and started taking deep breaths, and my symptoms and heart rate began to go down. When the ambulance arrived, they did an ECG and told me it was probably a scare — the ECG was completely normal.

i wanted to see if there was a way i could make this social anxiety battle better. so i did an online quiz on hers and they prescribed me sertraline (which i think is zoloft). but i saw online that taking this when you dont need it can be bad. idk something about brain zaps and stuff. i dont find myself to be a super depressed person. i have generally a good mood, i make it to all my classes despite not wanting to go, i push myself to finish all my assignments. i just want to know how i can conquer these difficulties. and i know it comes with practice, but practicing just leaves more depressed. because when i do participate, my anxiety makes it so bad that i never want to do it again. my cheeks get flush, i answer poorly, etc. please let me know if you‘ve felt similar and how you battled it. thank you ",1765757848.0,anxiety

1pmrquo,Death anxiety when you actually are chronically (but not terminally) ill,"Hey guys. 

My health anxiety has always had a very clear and direct tie to death anxiety. Consciously or not I’ve always been terrified of no longer existing. Not even the process of dying but whatever comes after. 

I’ve always been healthy except for mental health. However recently I’ve been dealing with a chronic condition. By no means terminal, it can be easily treated when acute severe symptoms are present, however lately I’ve been developing chronic mild symptoms too. In order to treat these I’d have to get to the root cause but this is taking time. I’m about to travel to see a specialist. 


So basically my situation rn is that I am dealing with mild but annoying / uncomfortable symptoms. As long as I do what’s necessary for prevention, these won’t get worse. But still, sometimes these mildly uncomfortable symptoms fill me with the same sense of dread as if I was dying, which I’m not. Oftentimes I am simply unable to cultivate a positive mindset. 

I’ve spent my entire life dreading illness while being healthy. I am simply not used to dealing with actual symptoms. My health anxiety was alresdy bad before I had an actual health problem, and now it’s making my health problem even worse by stacking this negative mindset on too of it.

Lately I feel like my anxiety has been manifesting as a lot more chest pain and shortness of breath and an overwhelming fear and I also just feel really uncomfortable like in my body I just don’t feel right almost antsy but it’s like I want to move and also I don’t. I just wish I could get some relief I am so jealous of all the people who do not have to live like this. I just feel like there’s no hope sometimes for an improvement like you just have to ride it out and it sucks it just flat out sucks! Has anyone ever tried those patches I’ve seen them at target that are supposed to help you relax? Like I wonder if those really even work cause they are kinda pricey but anyway give me your best tips and tricks please!! I can really use them right now! Thanks❤️",1765753335.0,anxiety
1pmqxj5,Anxiety After Hanging Out W Friends.,"I will start this by saying I currently live in a rehab facility, we are provided our own apartments and we have to follow certain rules. Because of this I don’t see others as much but sometimes I do go out to see others or have friends over. 

Lately, every time I spend time with someone, even if it went very well/I had fun/I enjoyed myself/I am very close to them- I feel overwhelming jitters and anxiety. I have that feeling of having to poop, I can’t stop shaking, I feel tense. My thoughts are racing but not really about the hangout just in general. I find it hard to really relax after the fact and it usually takes hours or a nap to go back to feeling normal. As the post suggests I have already had my fair share of issues with Xanax and opiates so that’s not an option for me. I’m just tired of shaking to death and feeling nauseous and tense even after I had a lot of fun and everything went really well. All I’m finding for answers to this is “listen to your instincts it could mean you can’t trust them, maybe you have an issue with them, maybe you don’t like thinking about how it went” but none of that is the case at all for me. I do have a low social battery and get burned out after too long. I just want to know if there’s a physiological reasoning for why my body gets so weird after interacting with others.

1pmqh84,Question I need help,"Hello everyone, I wanted to ask about what I’m going through.

First, I have been diagnosed with depression, depersonalization/derealization, and existential OCD (or existential anxiety).

What I experience is not just thoughts. These are the things that happen:

1. Every person, place, or anything I was living my life around while I had intrusive thoughts  when I see it now, I automatically remember the thoughts and feel sad again. I live like this all day long.

2. All day I have intense thoughts about how beautiful life was without these thoughts, how I would act, live, feel situations, and experience emotions if these thoughts didn’t exist. My life before the thoughts feels like it was open in front of me, and my mind keeps showing me the difference all day long.

3. Before every thought or feeling appears, the moment it comes, I feel like I’m thinking the wrong way and feeling the wrong way  even though I know that thoughts and feelings are automatic. It feels as if I am inventing new thoughts and feelings by myself, and that there is a “correct” way to think and feel, and I am thinking and feeling incorrectly.

5. I have learned to recognize intrusive thoughts, but my mind always tells me that maybe the thoughts I am doing exposure with and ignoring are not actually intrusive.

6. I constantly and excessively envy people who don’t have my thoughts and who live with values and principles they follow. I feel like I have lost everything. I envy how they know how to take a stance and live their lives, while I no longer have that.

Whenever I care about anything, my mind immediately starts saying: “Don’t care. We’re going to die. Nothing is real. You’re exhausting yourself for nothing.”

It feels like living inside a prison.

7. Even when I set things for myself to help reduce the thoughts, my mind starts telling me that I’m using them the wrong way, and that there is a specific program I must follow  even if what I set for myself is actually helping me.

8. My mind keeps reminding me all day of the headache caused by these thoughts. I am suffering

My question:

Has anyone gone through this?

Are these obsessive thoughts?

Is it normal to be tortured by these thoughts all day long",1765750057.0,anxiety
1pmq16d,Any fast-acting supplements for bad anxiety and fear for public speaking?,"Hi everyone,

So I have a small speech tomorrow that im doing alone. It is a partner or 3 person speech, but I am all alone for this one and I'm constantly thinking about that fact if people will think it's weird im alone. Anyway though, Ive always had bad anxiety with speaking in front of people. My face is red, heart is pounding (literally is looks like my body is shaking), my hands shake, I stutter, etc. I just feel that especially me being alone on a partner speech is causing me a lot of anxiety with my already bad fear of speaking in front of people. I feel like when I get up there, I'm going to embarrass myself so bad.

My speech is tomorrow morning so if there any supplements that I can buy today (at like Target) that are fast acting that will actually work to reduce or get rid my anxiety if I take it right before my speech? Please help and thank you very much!

1pmpkqw,Significant Health Anxiety and Brain Tumor Worries,"Hello Anxiety Reddit,

I am going through an especially rough spell of health anxiety and could use some strategies and reassurance to help combat my fears of a brain tumor or some type of tumor in my head/face. 

Ever since I was 8 years old, I have suffered from pulsing migraines that happen anywhere from 3 times a month to 3 times a week. Over time, I have learned to live with them, but they have been a significant factor in my life for a long time, as I am 23 now. About 2 years ago, I started taking a low dose of Amitriptyline, which has helped greatly and has reduced the number of headaches I have. My last severe headache episode was about 2 years ago when I went to the ER for a headache that lasted for 3 days straight; They did a CT scan that showed nothing, gave me the ER migraine cocktail, and sent me on my way. That provided reassurance for a decent amount of time. 

Within the last month or so, I've started having an increase in eye pain, which I'm not sure is eye strain, or something else. It feels as though the muscles in my eye are being pulled when I look in a certain direction. Additionally, when I press on my forehead, pain radiates down my forehead, through my left eye, and into my left nostril. I had an eye exam a few days after the first episode, and my doctor said everything looked very healthy and my prescription needed minimal adjustment. Again, this gave me some piece of mind for a while, until the eye pains started again. Today, I am on day two of significant eye pain, which again feels like soreness behind the eye. I am on screens all day for work and on my phone far too long each day, and I am trying everything I can to convince myself that this is just from severe eye strain or other environmental factors. I underwent a full panel of bloodwork at the start of September under my primary care doc's orders, which showed nothing out of the ordinary.

However, I can't stop my mind from making connections to other 'symptoms'. I have had trouble sleeping for the last 6 months or so since my wife and I got married and moved into a new place. I feel like I've been more forgetful recently, and maybe that could be related. I've been more fatigued than I feel I usually am. Ibuprofen doesn't seem to help with the eye pain, which comes and goes seemingly at random. My mind starts to spiral into all of the different possibilities, with the end conclusion being that I should make a trip to the ER and get a scan of my head to rule out a brain tumor. Please please please, any suggestions on how to curb my obsessions and endless googling, and reassurance that this is my anxiety talking, not a growth in my head (obviously, nobody here is a doctor and can say with 100% certainty, I understand that). I have lost the last 2 days of my life going down rabbit holes on Google and ChatGPT, and I would like to find some peace and sit down and play a video game without feeling like I need to be 'researching' my 'symptoms' online. Thank you all in advance!",1765747802.0,anxiety
1pmphwx,Thoughts on Hydroxyzine for anxiety & situational panic attacks?,"TL;DR How do you like Hydroxyzine? Dosage? Compared to other options***?***

Hello all,

I was prescribed 10mg of Hydroxyzine back in 2022 as needed after numerous health anxiety incidents & GAD. Being my own worst enemy, I never took the 10mg hydroxyzine due to worries about the side effects. I did practice some CBT since then, but still get panic attacks from a few situations (very large bridges, doctor's visits).

Fast forwarding to this month in 2025, we're driving from TX to GA/FL for Christmas with our dog, so I wanted something in case I need it for the drive (crossing the Mississippi river / Louisiana especially). I was able to get 25mg Hydroxyzine capsules prescribed.

The main bridge we're crossing is the Vicksburg bridge, which isn't nearly as bad as the ones in Baton Rouge / Lake Charles, but will probably take 30min - 1hr before the crossing to make it easier on myself and have my partner drive the final few hours that day.

For anyone that's taken Hydroxyzine, how did you like it? What was your dosage?

I don’t know if it’s trauma related somehow if that’s possible but I will try to explain it more. I have absolutely zero problem with masturbation, or attraction, or any of that. My problem lies in the act itself. I’m a virgin so I couldn’t tell you how I felt in the moment, but In every depiction or mention of sex or sexual activity or deep intimacy or any of that, I get super anxious and uncomfortable. Whether that be in a movie, in media online, even just seeing people flirt irl is enough to make me anxious sometimes. Even when my friends make a sex joke, or something inappropriate. I hate seeing anything that has anything to do with sex, until I get horny somehow. It sounds stupid to read all of that back, but that’s really the best I could explain it. I’m generally a very anxious person, and I’ve never been in a relationship either. I have very little sexual experience (more on that later if you need it), and it’s frustrating because I feel like an outcast somehow. Any input would be helpful.

Edit: I actually have never been with someone, and to my knowledge I have not experienced any type of sexual dysfunction. To clarify, my problem is that I get anxious about the act, not during because it’s never happened.",1765744717.0,anxiety

I have so many good things in my life. Like, seriously, on paper I am incredibly successful and fortunate. But I feel like I’m trapped in a life I don’t want and I don’t know how to get out of it. Every time I think about changing things I feel guilty for being unhappy with what I have, worried the people in my life will judge me for making poor decisions, and I’m not confident that I’ll ever be happy no matter what changes in my life. 

I’m at the point where I’m having constant panic attacks. I go to the gym, have a personal trainer, go for walks, do yoga a couple times a week, and meditate almost daily. When I have a panic attack I try doing my breathing exercises and the 5 senses thing. The 5 senses works for a minute then once I move on I slip back into panic. I can’t even do the breathing exercises any more because my chest is so tight I can’t breathe in all the way, which freaks me out and makes me panic more. 

I live with my fiancé but he’s absolutely no help. He just asked me if I was ok and I said no, I’m not ok. He sat next to me for a minute and didn’t say anything then abruptly got up and said, “I should get ready to go” and left for a party.

1pmlsqw,Anxiety is so debilitating,"(M20 years old) - My siblings keep telling me to get a job, but I just can't. 

For the past year, making it two years in 2026, I've been dealing with anxiety. Every time I go outside home, I always take my medication with me in fear that I will have an anxiety attack and I never go outside alone because I fear I might faint or have a cardiac arrest and no one would be there to help me.

For those past weeks, I've been dealing with intense anxiety, low blood pressure and panic attacks every single day. Literally, every single day, from morning to night. I feel my heartbeat going crazy despite doing nothing, I feel headaches that last a full day and a full night.

Yesterday, I decided to go to a night walk with a friend and through the entire time my heart was beating really fast, I was dizzy and I could barely stand up correctly. I called it off and went home feeling sick for the entire night.

How can I work like this? If I can't function correctly even at the smallest tasks, if I can't go outside without my medication, and if I can't even go outside without someone I know, how can I go to work, alone, with no medications and work from morning to the end of the evening?

I really wish I could work just fine. I wish I didn't have anxiety and depression, they are messing up with my lifestyle, they always have been. If only it was so easy, I would have found a job years ago.

We’ve tried a lot of things together over time - breathing exercises, journaling, routines, even just sitting quietly and talking things through. Some of it helped, some of it didn’t stick.

What’s been surprisingly helpful recently is having something very simple to reach for in the moment, especially when their thoughts start spiralling and they don’t want a long exercise or a full conversation.

I ended up putting together a small app mainly so they could quickly do a short breathing reset, feel gentle vibration cues, and just “dump” what’s in their head without overthinking it.

I am super worried that my new dizziness and headaches may be due to a brain tumor/cancer and I am wondering if I need new imaging. Has anybody else ever experienced these symptoms? If so, did you get further testing or did it eventually resolve? I'm not sure if it is due to anxiety or an actual medical issue. Thanks in advance!",1765736676.0,anxiety
1pmkwaa,Panic attacks with intense heart sensations — exhausted and looking for support,"**(**AI improved this as english is not my native language)

This started one evening when I woke up with a sudden sharp pain in my trapezius muscle. Not long after, I woke up sweating and shaking, completely convinced I was having a heart attack and was going to die. Looking back, it was my first major panic attack.

I rushed to the hospital — BP and ECG were normal. They told me I was fine, but I didn’t feel fine.

The panic attacks kept coming. After multiple visits, I tested positive for **H. pylori** and my diagnoses was stomach ulcers, gas, bloating, and constant burping. I later realized I had been mistaking many of these sensations for heart problems.

What scares me most is how my **heart and chest feel during panic**. Sometimes my heart beats very fast, sometimes very loudly, and I become extremely aware of every beat in my chest and neck. I also get sudden **electric-like zaps or jolts on the left side of my chest**, sometimes with sharp pain. It feels *wrong*, like something isn’t working properly, and that sensation alone sends me into full panic. Along with this, my **legs often feel weak, shaky, or unstable**, like they might give out during an attack. That loss of physical confidence makes the fear even worse.

A few days before all this started, I quit **nicotine pouches (Zyn)** after previously smoking, and I wonder if withdrawal played a role in triggering this anxiety spiral.

I’m currently on digestive medication and anxiety medication. Even so, panic attacks still happen — overwhelming fear, chest discomfort, sharp or electric sensations, strange muscle feelings, weakness, and a cold/burning sensation around my neck and arms (mostly on the left side). In those moments, reassurance doesn’t help because everything feels dangerously real.

I feel like my body is stuck in constant danger mode.

The hardest part is that **every panic attack brings thoughts of death**. My father passed away 8–9 months ago, and I never properly processed it. I stayed strong for everyone else. Now, when panic hits, my mind immediately jumps to thoughts of my own death, convinced something is being missed or that I won’t recover.

Doctors say it’s anxiety, stress, a hyper-alert nervous system, and unresolved grief. But it’s taking over my life. I’m in my final year of university, and instead of focusing on my future, I’m fighting my body and mind every single day.

I just want to feel normal again.  
I want to feel safe inside my own body.  
I’m exhausted.

If anyone has experienced panic attacks with strong physical symptoms — especially **heart sensations, electric chest pains, shaky legs, stomach issues, or anxiety linked to grief** — I would really appreciate hearing what helped you cope or feel safer again.",1765736278.0,anxiety

1pmixkd,Time Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

For a long time, I’ve struggled with time anxiety. But not in the existential type of way, where I’m afraid of the passage of time itself. Although I’m not entirely sure that *doesn’t* play a role… But for me, the bottom line is: anytime I have to do something that is unrelated to whatever productive thing or hobby I actually want to do, I start feeling anxious about how much time I have left to complete the unrelated thing and how to maximize the time remaining to do the desired thing.

Most often, it is related to when I want to write (my passion). So an example could be today: I’m meal prepping and cleaning the house, and I know I want to write something for a TTRPG campaign later, so every part of meal prepping and cleaning the house feels like a distraction and like something stealing away the time I have to be productive.

It’s messing with my head quite a bit. The result is that I don’t live in the moment often. I’m always thinking of the next part and maximizing my time. 

I’m really curious if other people experience this and how they go about dealing with it. It would be a way for me to understand my own version of it better.",1765731553.0,anxiety

1pmiaco,Living alone abroad,"Hi everyone. I’m a 22 year old girl. I just graduated college in May. I’ve been living with my parents since September and it’s been great. My parents and I didn’t have a strong relationship during college so I dormed one year and lived in an apt with a friend for two years. My last two summers I interned in DC and Prague. So this is the first time since freshman year I have been living w my parents with no toxicity. 

I signed myself up for a program when I was 19/20 due to not being so close with family. I wanted to get away. This meant after college I’d be working abroad years at a time, not really visiting home. I’m about to turn 23 in a week or so and lots of things have changed. My parents are getting older and I realized I want to be near family. But I also need to grow up. I can’t back out of this job (which I start in Jan) because I’d have to owe back a lottttt of money that the program invested in me. 

It feels like I’m mourning the future?? I can’t stop thinking where I’ll end up and what will happen if I’m unhappy. I’m scared of living completely alone. I’ve always had a roommate or my parents. I’m scared something will happen to me health wise or to my parents god forbid. Idk I’m just scared of dying alone or something bad happening and my parents aren’t near me. It’s so bad I can’t sleep. I wake up multiple times with anxiety and now I’m scared of sleeping because I know it won’t be peaceful. 

I have bad health anxiety. I’ve been in and out of the hospital since I was young but nothing terminal thank god. I’m definitely over thinking and should focus on the present but there’s this weight in my chest that comes and goes. And when it comes, it comes hard. I can’t sleep or eat. All I do is think about the scary what ifs and cry. It’s not healthy I know but my mind can’t help but go there.

I pray a lot. That’s my outlet but idk I just feel confused, scared, and lost. I just know bottom line is I need to be an adult, grow up, and learn how to be completely alone. But it’s just scary. I’ve never been truly alone physically.

Hello everyone.

I have been been described 0,5mg of alprazolam (xanax) from my doctor about one and a half months ago.

I epxerience ""panic attacks"" because I have a rare diesease called VSS which makes me see strange things all the time. It's making me anxious. It also gets worse from anxiety. The only thing that helps me is benzos. I have a past with abusing drugs and I have been clean for a while, but benzos scare me.

I take one maybe every three days, sometimes every 2 days. I try to never take one 2 days in a row. Because of the way it helps my visual impairments and anxiety (sometimes I can't catch a breath anymore and can't talk proberly anymore because I get so anxious, also my hands start shaking and I feel like I am going to die) I think about these pills every single day.

I am scared of getting addicted and would like to know your experience, because I am currently also on SSRI and nothing is helping my disease except benzos. There is no cure.

1pmheqe,From Confident and Social to Empty and Withdrawn — I Don’t Recognize Myself Anymore,"I have been feeling this way quite strongly lately, and I am worried it might get worse. Over time, I’ve lost many friends. There was a point when I genuinely felt like one of the most liked people around me — I was goofy, funny, and confident. That was true at one stage. But now, for reasons I can’t fully understand, my self-esteem feels almost nonexistent and my confidence has dropped drastically.

I’ve started withdrawing socially. Even if someone I know passes by, I often don’t greet them. I struggle to make decisions and feel constantly confused. I don’t have clarity about what I’ll do tomorrow, let alone about my long-term aspirations. When I say I have “no stress,” what I really mean is that I have no motivation — nothing feels urgent or worth engaging with.

At the same time, there’s significant pressure from my family. They expect me to pursue an LLM abroad and eventually settle there. As an Indian student, there’s an added fear that if I don’t secure a job overseas, the money spent on education abroad will feel wasted. Along with this comes the pressure of getting into a good college. Even when I went to Goa recently, I felt low-energy and disconnected, even around friends.

Over the past two years, I feel I’ve changed drastically, and not in a positive way. The confidence I once had feels completely gone. I mostly feel empty — nothing excites me, nothing feels worth looking forward to. I spend a lot of time lying down and doing nothing.

The video is about she saying thank you to the friends who played games with her, the viewers who watched her videos and the dev who created the game. Down below is her final letter, telling her long life story. And saying video is pre scheduled and by the time it is uploaded, she will no longer be in this world.

Recently I had a suspected UTI, took antibiotics and used some NSAID's and I think they've given me gastritis (this was from a doctor following some blood tests, physical exam and x-ray) and the timing is logically, very coincidental.

But my anxiety has gone through the roof, thinking it's something horrible and I'm going to die. I think logically this is exacerbating my symptoms but again, there's no logic with anxiety.

I am finding it incredibly difficult to cope and don't think whatever is ailing my stomach will resolve, unless I address the anxiety and stress.

So my question is, is it probably time to speak to a GP about medication? I've tried CBT and talk therapy in the past and it hasn't worked.

I have been stressing about work and an upcoming doctors appointment. My anxiety shows in physical forms before mental. So I absolutely think somethings medically wrong instead of uncertainty and nerves. After much contemplation, I reopened my hydroxyzine bottle yesterday and wow I missed my old friend. When I was prescribed it ~1.5 years ago the first place I came was Reddit to scare the shit out of myself. I read how much some people hate it and was sooo scared to take it. It took me weeks to build up some courage but I finally did and it saved me. I’m back after about 10.5 months off and the first morning of no anxiety in a few months feels so soothing, like there is nothing wrong with me!! I take 5 mg a day, I am VERY sensitive to medication so I know that sounds like nothing to some but to me it’s perfect. The first dose I ever took was 25 mg prescribed from my anxiety attack urgent care visit and that took me 2 full days to recover from. My dr recommended 10 mg, I was nervous so figured I’d start with 5 and have liked it so much that there’s no reason for me to increase.

1pmcm1o,Panic attack while driving,"Hello everyone, 

I just had one of the scariest experiences ever in my anxiety journey. Basically I was driving to my parents place and I suddenly got a weird feeling in my chest (it’s an anxiety symptom I’ve been having since years but somehow it still scares me). Well the next moment my hands start to tingle really bad and numb up. I can barely move them. The legs came next and then my whole ribcage squeezed together and tingled. I was hyperventilating at that point and continued to drive the remaining 20 min to my parents place. 

I was shaking by the time they opened the door for me and I was for the very first time convinced I needed paramedics. 

We called them and they did their testing. Getting a little blood sample and looking at my heart and all that. I describe the symptoms and that I thought I was having a stroke but they confirmed that it wasnt and it was a panic attack. 

I thought I could handle my anxiety but now I’m not so sure anymore.

The thought of being on a plane really scares me. I can’t imagine myself sitting in the seat and taking off especially once we’re in the air. I feel like I’d panic badly. What’s confusing is that when I was younger, I actually loved planes and flying, so I don’t understand how I became scared of it now.

One thing I know for sure is that I really want to travel. But now I’m scared that I won’t be able to because I’m too afraid to get on a plane. I’m worried that once we take off, I’ll start feeling air hunger, questioning my breathing, and then spiral into a panic attack.

I’m also scared that something medical could happen to me out of nowhere while I’m on the plane, and that I’d be stuck in the air, far from everything, with no way to get help. The idea of being trapped with my thoughts on a long flight, not being on the ground, really scares me.

1pmc3vl,Going back to Zoloft from lexapro,"
Hi all I’m looking for any similar experiences/advice. 

About 5 years ago I developed extreme health anxiety and panic disorder. I couldn’t leave the house work etc and had debilitating anxiety 24/7 and panic attacks multiple times a day. Eventually I got on Zoloft and after getting up to 100mg it essentially fixed me 99.9%. I could workout hard have lots of caffeine with no problem ( before anything slightly raising my heart rate would freak me out )

Last year I decided to taper off as I thought I was cured lol. I went from 100mg to 75mg and within the month of that the anxiety came back. My doctor told me to go back up to 100mg after being on 75 for 4 weeks. When I went up to 100mg I could only make it 3 weeks as the side effects were too bad, I felt no emotion besides dread and panic, I felt extremely depressed and anxious, and my panic attacks were back 100x. 

After this I went back to 75mg and cross tapered to lexapro. For about 3 months I sitting in a hospital parking lot every night and having bad panic attacks everyday. About a year later now and I’m on max dose of lexapro which helps with my general anxiety but still get panic attacks during excercise, lexapro makes it impossible to feel fully awake I’m always groggy, and it makes my appetite nuts. 

It works about 60% as well as Zoloft with 10x more side effects. 

Talking with my doc about possibly going back to Zoloft as maybe the side effects from when I tried to taper and go back up are going up and down in dose in a short amount of time after being stable for so long. Not sure what to do.

Looking for advice or similar experiences. Thanks guys !

I'm not fully cured but that's beside the point, one problem closes and another one appears. 

I was okay on 50mg, I was okay on 100mg, now here's where things get tricky... My parter and I had to temporarily move into my mum's house, and we never found our alone time. I started 200mg daily around that time because I desperately needed that emotional ceiling to control my anxiety for pure ocd. I think we had sex once in the 2 months we lived there.

I lowered my own medication... I know it’s not ideal, and I plan to speak to my doctor, but I felt stuck and needed to experiment carefully.

1pmaqce,Need some help and suggestions:),"hii! just to give y’all background info. I’m a 21 year old female. I’ve been experiencing dizziness/lightheadedness on and off for 2 years now. it started around dec 2023, but that was attributed more towards my vitamin levels being off and my pcod flaring up, causing my periods to not come for almost 4 months. after having medication for both these issues, the dizziness was solved to some extent and became more manageable. I had a bit of an episode around aug 2024 and visited an ENT, but nothing came out of it. he thought I may have meniers (since I was also having slight tinnitus) but the tests we did for it didn’t show that that was a possibility. things really escalated around nov 2024 when I had my first panic attack. My dizziness/lightheadedness became constant, along with some GERD-like symptoms. I was then diagnosed with anxiety (mainly health) and panic disorder. I was on anti-anxiety medication up until june of this year. I was much better during that period and was doing good after finishing my course of medication until about a month and a half ago. my lightheadedness has become more constant, along with persistent neck pain. so, I visited an orthopedist. I thought that a major thing that could be causing my recent spell of lightheadedness was the neck pain. but the doctor said that the neck pain is nothing major, so no nerve issues. so, he advised that I should go see an ENT again. visited a different ENT this time. she heard all my symptoms (which at the moment include dizziness, lightheadedness, neck pain, this weird band like headache from time to time, slight issues with vision including adjusting to light or an overstimulating environment, overall tiredness, disorientation) and said that I probably have vestibular migraine. so, she has started me on a magnesium supplement, tryptomer 10mg (which contains amitriptyline) and inderal la 20mg (which contains propranolol). These medicines didn’t really help and my dizziness continued, so my ENT told me to start a 10 day course of clonazepam 0.25 mg. All my symptoms felt so much better with that. She then has put me on fluoxetine 20mg for a week now but I’m feeling worse now. I’m feeling the head pressure, lightheadedness, stomach issues and just feeling very emotionally off since starting this new course. I also do therapy once a week.

pls give me some suggestions and tips for how I should proceed😭 I’ve been dealing with this anxiety for more than a year now and more than anything, it’s these physical symptoms that really bother me. ",1765707145.0,anxiety
1pmam4l,I honestly have no idea if it's anxiety or real health issues anymore,"In the last month or so (really since about the beginning of November) I have been stuck in a loop of different physical symptoms. I've been having a worse and worse time with every single thing that raises my heart rate in any way. It started with jogging - it got harder for me, so I stopped doing it, but I was also having stomach/diaphragm issues at the time. But it's slowly been getting worse to where even moving furniture, climbing stairs and getting excited, disappointed or angry gets my heart rate up, OR makes me feel out of breath OR makes me nauseous. The left side of my neck has been stiff the last few days and my arm feels like that pain when you've hit your elbow (you know the one), although that had been persistent for atleast 2 years (I work in an office and my elbow is on the desk all day). Not all of it is all the time, mind you, but one of those. I had a dream last night that I was walking down an upward escalator and that made me wake up out of breath and with my heart rate up. None of this seems good AT ALL. 

Except.... I went to a cardiologist a week ago (friday, dec. 5th) and I had bloodwork, echo and an EKG done before the echo. Everything was completely within normal boundaries. Am I going crazy? Like... since then I almost had a 1 vehicle crash on the highway which made my heart rate skyrocket although nothing happened, just got scared.... And that's it. Is it enough to ruin my heart since those tests? Is there any other tests I should get? Is it the anxiety again? Is it the stomach issues irritating nerves all over my body? I have no idea anymore.

This same period has also been terrible for me in terms of stress. I also had a few moments of great physical exertion due to overcompensating relationship issues with physical labor - the top one being carrying a 20kg car battery about half a kilometer cause I got angry that my battery died and just decided to buy a new one nearby and carry it back... I especially haven't been the same since then although supposedly I recovered physically.


So basically... it's been so much shit I don't even known if it's the anxiety or something physcial anymore. And if it IS physical what do I even need to do - what specialist do I go to? Should I get any more heart checkp ups? I don't wanna label very tangible physical suffering as anxiety and miss something. At the same time I know how much worse anxiety can make physical symptoms, and I know how VERY real psycosomatic symtoms are, especially if you're a professional hypochondriac like me.

Just started Prozac (10 mg) and wondering if others with similar rumination noticed it helped reduce the constant mental looping (and how long it took)

One of my main anxiety/OCD themes is financial anxiety. Even when I’m doing objectively fine, my mind fixates on worst-case scenarios. Loss of income, something going wrong or everything falling apart financially.

A lot of this is rooted in past experiences, including an unforeseen medical issue that lasted years, took up a big part of my 20s and drained me financially. Since then, my brain seems hyper alert to anything money related, and the obsessive rumination has gotten worse as the economic climate in my country has continued to deteriorate.

I’m working with both a psychiatrist and a therapist. Today is day 1 for me on Prozac (10 mg), and I’m wondering if anyone with money-focused anxiety/OCD (or similar ruminative anxiety) noticed a reduction in the constant mental looping after being on it for a while....and roughly when that started to happen.

1pm5nst,"facing your fears, but then it backfires?","Several times over my life, I have ""faced my fears"" despite the overwhelming anxiety. This usually ended up backfiring and left me in an even more fragile state. 

It's ended up manifesting in trying lots of different things instead of sticking with one thing because most things have ""traumatized"" me in some way. I know continuously trying new things is unsustainable. 

I don't know what to do now as medication never worked for me. My body really does seem to store the information and I immediately feel tense. New things do not have an associated memory so I feel more open to trying. Does anyone else deal with this?",1765688089.0,anxiety
1pm5lis,Anxiety relief,"Hello. I just want ANY insight on people who had uncontrollable anxiety and what cured it (as much as possible). I’ve tried countless meds for over that two month trial period. Meditation. I’ve been in therapy for 10 years. Tried countless things. Yet I have anxiety and panic attacks that has caused seizures and fainting. Panic attacks that cause shaking (extremely embarrassing in public and can’t stop it). Uncontrollable hot flashes and sweating. This started when I was 11 (violent home, triggering stuff that I won’t mention etc). I am 30 now with no relief. Last ditch effort is me posting this here. Anyone any insight on a magical cure or what helped? I do gratitude journals and alllllll the hype stuff that trends. I’m just exhausted from anxiety and at my wits end. Anything helps. (Tried 420 and it increased anxiety for me if that’s someone’s possible suggestion).

Anything helps. Thanks. ",1765687878.0,anxiety

Started Prozac, well Prozac did nothing but give me a panic disorder, so after 8 weeks got off that. Zoloft I then tried which did work but 10 weeks in I was just so out of it, just like I was on drugs. Silly mistakes at work that were impacting my career a lot. Super tired all day, which was terrible because I’m big into fitness and bodybuilding, also i work physically demanding jobs. It’s hard to get work done when you’re tired all day. Thank god I quit these right when sexual side effects started. After now being off them I look back and realized how out of it and different I was. My family was actually the ones that said you need to stop these. I had family and friends telling me I don’t seem myself and seem not too with it. Just a forewarning for anyone trying these drugs. My anxiety is about the same because I feel like these medicines never really did anything tbh. I have just really gotten better with exposure, mostly starting a new job had made my anxiety absolutely worse but now having been working it more I feel better. Imo these drugs are best suited for severe cases, not saying mine wasn’t but i was still function able my life is just harder with anxiety.

1pm50pu,"Face fear directly. The moment you stop running, fear becomes energy you can control.","
Most people think fear is something to get rid of. It is not. Fear is raw energy with no direction.

Running from fear scatters that energy and keeps your nervous system in a chase loop. Avoidance gives fear momentum. That is why it grows, returns, and feels uncontrollable.

When you stop running and stay present with it, something strange happens. Fear loses its narrative. The body charge remains, but it is no longer hostile. It becomes available energy.

This is the shift.
Avoidance equals loss of control.
Presence equals ownership.

Fear only dominates while it is framed as an enemy. When you face it without acting, suppressing, or dramatizing it, the polarity collapses. What remains is clarity, drive, and stability.

You do not defeat fear.
You reclaim it.

1pm4x3o,Anxiety.. ibs c symptoms..,"Okay I sit here reading stories all day and I want to let mine out. I’m a 19F, back when I was 16 ( aug 2022) I had a bad high and from that day forward, I was never the same. I started to be paranoid every time I left the house until I realized, why am I thinking these things? Then came the de realization. It would hit me like a bus and I would get so scared bc i felt as if I smoked and a high just hit me out of no where. I was a senior in high school at the time of this and would go sit with the councilor. This was in fall. Here comes spring time and the anxiety took a big huge turn. I started to feel all the physical symptoms, shaking, heart racing, thoughts racing just idk anxious but not just in my head anymore. So at this point I was convinced I really had something wrong. This time was honestly the worst time of my life I can say. After i graduated everything got really bad. I couldn’t sleep alone anymore. I couldn’t drive anymore. I couldn’t hang out with my friends anymore without thinking the worst was going to happen. I just couldn’t think straight at all anymore. I couldn’t go anywhere without a water bottle bc drinking sips was the only thing that allowed me to feel like I could breathe. I slept with my mom from around April- December. She doesn’t know how much she saved me honestly. 

Anyway, in July 2023 I started to notice a pain in my rib cage area. Brushed it off. 

In October I took medicine to not be nauseous on a boat ride and FOR THE ONE time I told myself to just take the medicine and not search up all the side effects. Bad idea this time. I took too much than I was supposed to. I ended up feeling “high” and panicked. Bad.  I was just super drowsy and in a hot island and i felt drugged. After this my eating went downhill. I was scared to eat ANYTHING in fear that it would be drugged or accidentally have some type of drug in it. So i wouldn’t really eat as much or be super nervous when I did. 

I want to sum things up. The pain in my rib area lasted. A long time. Eventually I went to the doctor.so far from 2024- now I’ve gotten blood test, urine test, x ray, ct scan, colonoscopy, ultrasound, h pyroli test and they say that everything is perfectly FINE like straight out the books.  Other than constipation. 

The pain is worst now. It goes to my back it goes to the front and side it just hurts more now. I can’t convince myself it’s all in my head. 

Back when my anxiety first started my fear was death. I was extremely scared of dying and had so much impending doom. Now I’m just scared of being sick  I have such bad health anxiety like If it’s not being scared about one disease or sickness it’s another. I feel like I hear people talk about it but no one has it as bad as me. Anyway I spend most of my days constipated and stressing about being constipated and bloated and feeling full and being in pain. Not bad pain. More so discomfort. I’m scared of medicine so that’s not really helpful to hear. MiraLAX doesn’t do anything. Prune juice either.

Idk I just need some advice or at least to feel understood just please. I’m EXHAUSTED. I feel stuck , I feel like this is never going to end and eventually I’m just going to die from a disease that doctors never found or one random day im going to just get a sharp pain of like my colon exploding and not make it to the hospital. I’m haunting myself every single day I am truly exhausted physically and mentally I have no idea what to do. I think I could never pull myself out of this nor can anyone else.

1pm3wpv,Guys need some suggestions please on how to manage palpitations and trembling during excitation or nervousness,"Hi guys 25M here. I have anxiety issues from a long time. From around 15 age. I have ocd too from 20 years age but that's another thing.All these years from 15 age one issue that has always bothered me is high amount of hyper excitation or nervousness. Like during school or college years I used to get palpitations before face to face exams. Means getting them before going in although settling down after some while. Similarly if I am excited about anything I get palpitations really quickly. That gets uncomfortable and awkward for me because it sort of ruins special moments.

Like recently 2 days ago I got engaged. From the point of reaching the venue till all rituals and other things and till photographs I was getting consistent palpitations. Means slowing down then again starting. During ring exchanging my hands were shaking and fiancee too noticed that but didn't said anything. Although she held my hand firmly then. I was trying really hard to control it. Then afterwards during photoshoot she could feel my heartbeat going fast. I haven't felt any issues because of my this problem 
But first time in my life I am feeling really embarrassed 🥲
We both were talking yesterday and she mentioned that and although I explained casually that it's my childhood issue and she was understanding and supportive but I am feeling really really bad. As a guy I shouldn't be the one getting this jittery or nervous. I know that this problem will remain there my whole life but atleast with spending time with her It will get normal like my daily life. But atleast I don't want that my special moments get uncomfortable and sort of ruined because of this.
We will get married in some time now and I know this all will happen again 🥲😭

Essentially we were talking and I guess it was obvious that I was nervous (I can’t keep eye contact, look around everywhere, scratching the back or my head,etc) cause she mentioned that she could tell I had some sort of social anxiety and she was getting anxious too. 
She said something else, but I don’t really remember cause the first thing I started thinking about was, “holy shit I’m about to lose my new friend because I’m making her nervous cause I can’t control my own nerves.” I’m pretty sure I played it off cool cause I just chuckled, said my bad and moved to ending the conversation. (I didn’t want to bother her) she didn’t seem annoyed or anything. I just keep replaying it and I feel bad but then again I’m kind of curious cause I’ve never heard of that happening before. But in my friend group I’m the one with anxiety and introverted, the rest of them are all extroverted and love being around people. I just don’t know if I’m overthinking it or if this is something that is common when two people with anxiety interact or if I potentially messed up and I’m now I’m going to lose my friend because I’m a walking trigger.

1plzdav,"Fear of being alone, abandoned","Hi! I’m kind of spiraling and could use some perspective.

Growing up, my home was emotionally cold. I don’t remember ever hearing “I love you.” My dad was very authoritarian, dismissed me a lot, yelled/insulted me, and criticized my appearance. I never really felt emotionally safe. Because of that, emotional stability and being chosen as a partner (even when life is hard) is the main thing I want from a relationship/marriage.

My boyfriend now, is usually warm and supportive (he’s basically my main emotional support), but we recently talked about marriage/kids and he said marriage doesn’t mean much to him without biological kids. He’s not open to adoption/fertility treatment/being child-free, and he even suggested trying to get pregnant first and only getting married if pregnancy happens.

That conversation completely triggered my fear of being abandoned. Now I can’t stop thinking: what if I can’t get pregnant or I miscarry, would I be left?

Since then I’ve been crying a lot, my appetite is way down, I can’t focus, and daily life feels hard. The idea of breaking up makes me panic because I feel like I’ll end up totally alone.

1plz8a1,Has anyone else had their life ruined by extreme perfectionism?,"Hi, I’m a 28-year-old woman with an official diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. As long as I can remember, I’ve struggled with anxiety and perfectionism. From the outside, people probably wouldn’t think I’m a perfectionist, but internally I fight daily battles.

For example, during my adolescence I suffered from body dysmorphic disorder. I didn’t have friends because I felt that if I wasn’t perfect, I didn’t deserve them. I didn’t get good grades because if I wasn’t going to do my assignments perfectly, what was the point of doing them at all?

I used to think my problem was only related to my physical appearance, but over time it spread to other areas of my life. For instance, I change my bedroom every three days because it never feels right—only at the beginning. I don’t buy new clothes because my body isn’t “perfect,” so why bother trying to look good? I have a PS5 gathering dust because in my mind there’s overwhelming anxiety about owning games both on my computer and on a console (I feel like I can only have games on one or the other).

To sum it up, I’ve lost huge amounts of opportunities simply because things don’t feel “right” or the moment doesn’t feel “perfect.” I’ve lost romantic dates because I don’t feel mentally or physically perfect enough to meet someone. I’ve lost jobs because I’m terrified of making mistakes at the beginning and disappointing people. And the list goes on and on.

I hope someone can understand this. I’d really like to know that I’m not the only one.

1plyi1h,Long story about leaving lexapro cold turkey.,"Well, I just want someone to relate and give em hopw, I stupidly left my lexapro cold tturkey 6 months ago, nothing happened, but I had a health scare and anxiety took over, bad. I've been getting better, I restarted my lexapro to a lower dose for some reason according to my.psychiatrist , that was 2 months ago, and 1 month ago i upped the dose to my original dose of 20 mg. There still time to go for me to feel normal, but the big problem os I have no crutch, i feel somewhat normal, but whenever an attack comes in, I have nothing that works, i tried xanax, clonazepam, diazepam, at the most clonazepam.makes me sleepy and i wake up without the attack, but every day I'm just wondering if it's gonna be a normal.day or if the physical.syphysicawill.come.back.

Pregabalin seemseto.have worked on me to calm me.down, ive been taking it for almost two weeks, but my anxiety is still there, and I feel like I just need to.experiment on dosage, all the psychiatrists I go to are really slow and exclusive and expensive, I have no momey becaise of.this debilitating.anxiety.

the only hope I have, and this is where I hope others maybe relate, is that in 2018 when my anxiety first appeared lexapro did help, and I had 6 years of no panic or pain. But my Anxiety is very physical, I seemengly.have no.triggers, and the physical symptoms.cna be very intense, like.hours long weird electrical sensations in my spinal column, very hot hot flashes , when i firdt started anxiety i had the typical shortness of breath and heart problems at first, then it moved on the this weird pain on the back of my.throat muscles, etc. 

I think pregabalin.has.worked, i need something like.a.crutch while.lexqpro.does.it's job, anyone else just seemengly.have no troggers and their physical.symptoms are super intense? Anyway I guess I rambled enough, but yeah, I think I need.to.up.the dose of pregabaalin or keep lookiloofor.a benzo, I havent tried ativan yet for example.

1plw5jx,Anxiety from medication,"Hello everyone! 

Little back story before I state the current issue I’m facing - 

I was on 12 different anti-anxiety medications from 2020-2022. I then cold turkey them and felt amazing! Stress free, working full time, living a normal life. 

Last year in April, I tore my ACL and had a complication with my surgery where I almost died. I began expecting panic attacks, and was placed back on medication (Cymbalta). That worked for a short period of time before my body became tolerant to it. My psychiatrist then suggested I try vortioxetine. Which, I have the prescription in hand, but I haven’t taken a single dosage of it. 

The issue is, I have medication anxiety. For the past year I have refused to take any new medications I wasn’t taking prior to my injury (besides alprazolam) because I get this overwhelming sense of doom thinking about taking new medication. 

Has anyone else experienced this and if so, what helped/helps you overcome this fear? 

Thank you!

1plut0h,Does it get better?,"I had my first panic attack, out of the blue, last March. At the time I didn’t know what panic attacks even were, so I assumed it was a heart attack, leading me to an ER visit. It was so new to me that it was extremely traumatic.

I started having them every day or every other day, a GP prescribed a benzodiazepine which helped for a while until I got my hypothyroidism diagnosis which made me spiral again, I was (still am) convinced that there is something wrong in my body.

It continued for months. Panic attacks, floating anxiety, daily fear of death, fear of my heart stopping, which prompted me to see a cardiologist who basically told me “Dude… just go see a psychiatrist “ 

So I saw one and they put me on Lexapro 10mg, the panic attacks stopped for the most part but there was still floating anxiety 2 months later, my dose was upped to 15mg.

Lexapro helped a lot with my depression and getting my life back together but despite having way way less panic attacks, the creeping floating anxiety every day (usually during the second half of the day) is becoming unbearable and I feel hopeless. I just don’t know if anything can make it better.

1pltji9,My experience with weight change on sertraline (timelines + specifics),"I spent a long time searching forums for clear, comparable experiences around weight gain on sertraline and how long it took to reverse after stopping, so I’m sharing my own experience in case it helps someone else looking for data points rather than reassurance.

Background
•	Female, 35
•	Naturally slim my whole life. 5ft 6.
•	Pre-children: ~8 stone (technically underweight for my height, unable to gain weight)
•	Post-children, pre-sertraline: stable at 8.8 stone, highest my weight would increase to was 8.10 stone. 
•	Long-standing water retention, previously only in legs and manageable by limiting very carby foods
• I have 2 dogs so I walked a lot, but I never spent time actively exercising.

On sertraline
•	Started sertraline: October 2023
•	Initially I lost weight: By early December 2023 I was 8 stone 5.
•	Then I had rapid weight gain: By Mid-December 2023 → early January 2024: my weight increased to ~9 stone
•	My new weight fluctuated around 9.5 stone - 9.9 stone
•	Heaviest recorded weight: 9.12 stone

Although this weight range is medically in healthy range for my height, it was significantly higher than my lifelong baseline.

Pattern of weight gain
•	Weight gain appeared hormonal in nature
•	Distribution was uneven: Upper body remained unchanged. Weight and fluid accumulation primarily from abdomen downward. I developed abdominal water retention, which I had never experienced before
•	Dietary strategies that had previously controlled water retention (lower-carb intake) became ineffective.
•	I experienced increased cravings for sugary and fatty foods (assumed medication-related), though intake did not significantly change.
•	Prior to sertraline, I could eat freely and reduce carbohydrates for 1–2 days to manage water retention; this strategy no longer worked.
•	Maintaining baseline physical activity had no effect on weight or fluid retention.
•	Motivation for exercise reduced significantly; I walked the dogs because I had to, not because I wanted to.

Stopping sertraline
•	Stopped sertraline: 9th May 2025

Post-discontinuation timeline
•	May 2023 → October 2025: no meaningful weight change
•	Despite stopping medication, weight and water retention remained the same 
•	No immediate reduction in bloating or abdominal fluid


Exercise factor
•	Began running: June 2025
•	The motivation behind this was body image distress rather than fitness goals
•	Outcome: Running did not lead to weight loss or reduction in water retention in the short or medium term
•	No visible or measurable change while hormones were likely still adjusting
•	My view: Exercise may now be supporting weight loss… But it did not trigger it. The change appears more closely linked to hormonal normalisation over time

When weight began to shift
•	First noticeable change: November 2025
•	Approx. 6 months after stopping sertraline
•     Current weight 8.12 stone. 
•	Change was gradual rather than sudden
•	Suggests delayed hormonal recalibration rather than calorie/exercise driven weight loss


Key takeaways from my experience
•	Weight gain on sertraline can be delayed, hormonal and water-retention heavy
•	Weight may persist months after discontinuation
•	Exercise alone may not override hormonally-driven weight changes
•	For me, meaningful change did not occur until hormones had time to stabilise

Posting this because I couldn’t find many experiences that included:
•	long-term timelines
•	hormonal suggestions/water retention changes 
•	delayed post-discontinuation changes
•	weight gain in someone without prior weight issues

I hope this helps anyone looking for comparable data. For context, I’m very pro-medication. I have GAD and panic disorder and sertraline was necessary at the time to stabilise my nervous system enough to engage in therapy. It was effective and helped me through a severe period. If I were to relapse, I would take sertraline again without hesitation

I’m sharing this purely for informed consent reasons. Weight gain wasn’t something I felt prepared for and knowing in advance that it could be hormonally driven and persist after stopping would have helped me manage expectations and cope better with the physical changes.

1plt34z,Is this health anxiety or should I get more tests done? [Details inside],"This will be a bit long description. Thanks for reading.

I’m 32 years old with no significant past health conditions, though my mother is a type 2 diabetic, and my father had blood pressure issues and underwent angioplasty about 20 years ago.

Over the past 3-4 months, I've experienced multiple episodes of waking up in the middle of the night with a racing heart. The initial episodes were quite distressing, as it was a new experience for me, and I even had one during the day. These incidents led me to become hyper-aware of any changes in my heart rate at all times. I started constantly checking my pulse, trying to assess whether my heart was racing or if it was normal. Even the slightest sensation in my chest made me worry that something was wrong with my heart. I became overly sensitive to any heart-related sensations.

In more recent episodes, I’ve learned to manage the situation better. I reassure myself that it will pass, lie in bed, breathe deeply a few times, and slowly my heart rate returns to normal.

So far, I don’t have any other symptoms during these episodes—no shortness of breath, dizziness, or anything else. However, sometimes I feel some bloating near the stomach-diaphragm area, which makes me wonder if my symptoms could be related to poor lifestyle habits, especially around sleep and dinner, which may be affecting my circadian rhythm.

Here’s why I think that might be the case: for the past 3 years, I’ve averaged only about 6 hours of sleep per night. I often get caught in overthinking certain aspects of my life, which causes mild anxiety (though nothing too serious). I typically have dinner around 10 PM, go to bed at 1:30 or 2 AM, and often scroll through social media before falling asleep. I’ve also noticed that I snore, which makes me wonder if there might be some breathing obstruction causing me to wake up with a racing heart. However, I can’t confirm if I’ve always snored, or if I’ve had previous episodes of waking up like this without paying much attention. Also, 4 out of 10 times, I’ve been having some kind of dream (though I’m not sure if it’s a nightmare) when I wake up with the racing heart.

I’ve had blood work done three times this year, and the latest results were normal in terms of hemoglobin, lipid profile (cholesterol, triglycerides, etc.), and other parameters. The only concern was my high-sensitivity CRP, which came back at 4.56 (anything above 3 is considered high).

I consulted a cardiologist with these results, but I feel like he didn’t fully understand my situation. He prescribed beta blockers for anxiety and blood pressure, but I feel the prescription was based more on my blood pressure reading during the appointment, which was 149/88, and a heart rate of 117. I think those readings were influenced by my anxiety about seeing the doctor, and I don’t believe they accurately reflect my usual condition. Additionally, the nurse who took my blood pressure didn’t seem to pay attention to my posture, and she took the reading three times. The cardiologist also mentioned that my circadian rhythm might be off due to my poor sleep and dinner habits.

I chose not to take the prescribed medications and instead sought a second opinion from an experienced family member who works in pathology. He advised against taking the blood pressure medications since I don’t have high blood pressure. He suggested that I could take amitriptyline in a very mild dose if needed, but only as a last resort.

This whole experience has led to increased health anxiety, and now I’m afraid of going anywhere alone. Any time I feel a twitch or unexplained pain in my chest, I immediately worry it’s something related to my heart.

I’d appreciate any advice from people who’ve overcome similar situations.

1pls2j5,Used nasal spray every night for 2+ years. Quitting was brutal. Sharing what helped.,"Posting this because I wish someone had told me earlier.

After a nose surgery, I started using a decongestant spray “just to sleep.”  
That turned into **every single night for more than 2 years**.

If I skipped it, my nose felt completely blocked.  
I’d wake up early, anxious, mouth-breathing, feeling stuck.

Eventually I learned the spray itself was the problem **rebound congestion**.

Stopping was hard.  
Days 3–5 were brutal. Even around day 10–12, breathing still felt uncomfortable.  
I even slipped once because I was desperate.

What slowly started helping:  
• completely stopping the decongestant  
• switching to **budesonide nasal spray (Budenase AQ)** (non-addictive, but slow)  
• saline spray and steam  
• sleeping with head elevated or on the opposite side  
• breathing exercises when I felt like I “couldn’t get air”

**Recovery timeline (rough, based on my experience):**

* **Days 1–3:** Didn’t feel much improvement. Nose still felt blocked, especially at night. This phase tests your patience.
* **Days 4–7:** Breathing slowly became easier. Less constant stuffiness. Sleep started improving a bit.
* **Days 10–14:** Noticeable improvement. Nose felt lighter. Less urge to reach for the spray.
* **Weeks 3–6:** Swelling continued to settle. Breathing felt much more normal and stable.

Big thing I learned: healing is **slow**.  
This isn’t a 2-day fix it takes weeks.

If you’re using nasal spray daily and feel stuck you’re not alone and you’re not broken.  
Your nose just became dependent.

I’m still recovering, but it *is* improving.

It does not happen frequently but sometimes it is a bit frequent. all in all it effects my studies. Is this case normal. All people have these thoughts?.

example of imaginary thought are-

1. Thoughts like I have done engineering in all branches and made some fighter jet which beats all other fighter jets.
2. I have done something impressive and US govt offered me Free Gold card visa.
3. It can be any other imaginary thought.
4. Iam talking to a doctor before actually visiting doctor and explaining my issues.

Case 2- when Under office stress

If I have office stress then while studying i will definiltely keep thinking about the office stress either while watching videos or even if iam not watching videos, i keep thinking about the office situation and sometime used to watch mirror twice or thrice while ruminating. In this case, i dont get any other imaginary thought as i get in case 1 when no stress is there. For this, 5 yrs back doctor has given me Escitalopram 20 mg and iam still taking it. Also added risperidone 0.5 mg which i took for 2 yrs and stopped it last 2 yrs back since i was feeling as if my muscle lack power. Also i feel a bit sleepy between 6 Pm to 8 PM and i think risperidone is responsible for this. Also Iam taking propanolol 40 mg twice a day for essential tremors of left hand.

Now i have went to another psyhytrist and he has also put on Escitalopram 20 mg and risperdone 0.25 mg but to be honest Iam not liking risperidone anymore. Iam of the view it is effecting my memory a bit and have read that all antipsychotic makes essential tremors worse in long run. I aldo dont know why doctors prescribe antipsychotics.

1plq0qj,"Anxiety has taken over my body and life, and I feel stuck and alone","I don’t really know how to start this, but I need to get it out somewhere because I’ve been carrying it alone for too long.

Over the past year, my anxiety has slowly taken over my life. It wasn’t always like this. I used to feel more normal, more present. Now I feel like my body is constantly in survival mode.

It started after a breakup in April 2024, my first relationship. We’re still “friends,” but she’s now dating one of my good friends. Seeing them together or even seeing pictures of them hurts more than I expected. It feels like the wound never gets a chance to heal.

At the same time, I’ve always been very skinny and my family keeps commenting on it. I know they may not mean harm, but constant taunts have really destroyed my confidence over time.
I finished 12th grade in May 2025, but not with great marks. My dream is to study abroad, and I’m trying my best but it feels incredibly difficult in my situation. I’ve been at home for about 6 months now while my friends are already in college. My father scolds me for not trying enough and I already feel bad enough about myself.

Now the anxiety part:
My heart races even when I’m just sitting and doing nothing. I feel on edge most of the day. I get panic attacks randomly. At night, I can’t sleep for the first 1–2 hours because my mind and body won’t calm down. I have brain fog, forget things easily, zone out, and feel disconnected from myself.

The scariest part is that my body reacts like I’m in danger even when I’m not. It feels like my system is stuck and won’t switch off.
I don’t really have friends I can talk to anymore. After school ended, everyone drifted away. All of this has been buried inside me with no outlet. I feel extremely alone with my thoughts.
I don’t want to die, I want to live normally. I want to enjoy life like other people. But right now it feels impossible to live fully like this. I’m physically safe, but mentally I feel exhausted and overwhelmed.

I guess I’m posting here because I want to know:

1. Has anyone else felt like anxiety completely took over their body like this?

2. Can this actually get better?

3. What helped you when you felt stuck and alone?

1plpj3b,GAD or hormonal mess?,"A bit of context.

after a massive panic attack in October, I came off the pill after 4 years the same month (assuming the panic attack was hormonally triggered, I pieced it together eventually and it was caused because i accidentally took a sertraline tablet instead of a paracetamol in the night, and the unexpected brain zaps terrified me into panic). The doctor then put me on citalopram for a week thinking I had GAD before I worked it out, and that was making me vomit daily so I naturally stopped taking that. The doctor then forced me onto the mini pill for around 3 weeks last month after finding endo, I was an absolute wreck, heavy bleeding for 9 days and crazy heart palpitations so I came off that.

I’m just assuming my body hasn't had one opportunity to settle, after such big emotion shifts in such little time. I'm not anxious, mentally im fine. But the physical anxiety symptoms are ruining my life. The stomach churning, the air hunger, the general uncomfortableness in my body. Not to mention the crying over every slight inconvenience, I’ve always been an emotional person anyway but this is crazy. The sleeping patterns too, I can wake up like 5 times in the night.


It only seems to hit at the same time every day pretty much, never when I’m at work, never when I’m distracted. Always in the evening or night. 

I’ve had some good days of calm, multiple in a row with 0 symptoms and brilliant sleep, I’ve never really suffered with anxiety and I know my panic attack was caused by actual fear of something, not out of nowhere. But I just want to know if this is something I shouldn’t be labelling as hormonal. 

I’m week 3 into the journey of 0 pills in my body, so I know im very early into it compared to the 8 weeks of non stop pill popping my body has been through. All my bloods have came back fine, but I don’t want to see another doctor for them to put me on another tablet and send me out the door. I haven’t had a proper period yet either.

1ploggq,My obsession has ruined my life. I hate being so weird.,"This is probably going to sound stupid or illogical for some people, but I want to share it with you nevertheless.

Since I was a kid, I've been obsessed with numbers and statistics. I'm not smart, and I never had good grades in school either, but it was really uncomfortable for me to think that I was missing information about the world. Because of that, I got to know how poor the world is, how many people die of unnatural causes, and how many children are being born in poor countries. I realized how shitty the world is and how privileged I was (despite I'm poorer than most people around me).It may sound unbelievable, but thinking about this gives me severe headaches, anxiety attacks, and spontaneous crying. I can't live thinking that I've been born in a privileged European country with a 0.04% probability of being born. I just can't accept it. It's horrible. It makes me not want to live anymore. The therapist doesn't know how to help (and she doesn't care about me very much because she has lots of patients, and one lost case doesn't bother her very much.) I'm extremely anxious about this. Some people have told me with a smile to stop worrying about other people' bad lives, but that lack of empathy only made me feel worse. I hate this fucking world and humanity so much. I don't want to live here.

By the way, I want to make clear that I do not feel guilty, it's just that, as I'm obsessed with percentages, I hate the idea of being part of a minority.

1plnfgp,Life after GAD,"Did anyone here take paxil for GAD ? I was diagnosed with GAD and depression 3 years ago and was prescribed paxil. I took it for 8 months and it did magic for my anxiety but I had to stop it because I gained so much weight. My psychiatrist told me to try to stop completely without replacing it with another medication. Which I did and even after stopping it, my anxiety got so much better. I'm still doing therapy and I still get anxious but it's much better than before. After stopping l, I went through a rollercoaster of emotions where I would just start crying uncontrollably. But this lasted only for one month and got much better afterwards. 


However, after more time I started to feel that my whole life changed, like I became more connected to myself now that the anxiety was gone but I was still feeling my emotions very intensely. I'm working with my therapist to try to identify emotions as I couldn’t do this when my anxiety was present.


I went through a lot of hard times last year and they affected me a lot, but I also found myself having obsessive tendencies and couldn't regulate my emotions at all. I would fall into cycles of obsessing over a thought sometimes for days without being able to think or talk about anything else. It became a bit too much on my friends and my partner but no matter how much I tried I couldn't break the cycles until I got very burned out. And I feel that when my anxiety was worse, my emotions were more under control but now I can't control them at all. I can't even do the things that used to help me before, like writing or listening to music. 

I don't know if this makes sense or if it's related to the treatment or it's related to the events that happened last year. But I've never felt like this in my whole life. Has anyone had a similar experience with GAD and paxil?",1765638227.0,anxiety
1pln1mx,Anyone healing from DPD and severe attachment anxiety? I need hope,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently in therapy and was recently diagnosed with Dependent Personality Disorder (DPD), alongside severe anxiety and attachment-related nervous system dysregulation.

My main struggle is that my nervous system becomes extremely activated in close romantic relationships — especially around fear of abandonment, distance, or uncertainty (travel, delayed responses, etc.).

Cognitively I understand what’s happening, and I’m actively working on it in therapy (psychodynamic work, journaling, exposure, nervous system regulation).  
But on some days, my body reacts with intense fear, crying, exhaustion, and a feeling of losing inner stability. Occasionally I need a PRN medication to calm my system.

I grew up in a stressful and emotionally unsafe environment, so I know this reaction isn’t really about my partner — it’s old wiring and dependency patterns.

I’m not looking for quick fixes or reassurance.
I’m honestly just wondering:

• Has anyone here lived with DPD or strong dependent attachment patterns?
• Did things actually improve with therapy and time?
• What helped your nervous system become more stable and autonomous long-term?

I’d really appreciate hearing real experiences — especially from people who’ve been in therapy and stayed committed to the work.

Thank you 🤍

I think it’s really frustrating them that they can’t fix me.

I try my best to calmly comfort them and explain it isn’t their fault and all I need is for them to just remain verbally supportive and encourage my efforts, but it does take its toll on our relationship - especially when there’s anger directed at me during a panic attack.

All of this is incredibly hard to write, because I don't know how to describe how I feel. I had a therapist in the past and I'm working on finding another one, as her communication just didn't mesh with mine and she only made me more anxious by it.

I have perfectionism, and it's where my anxiety stems from. Sometimes, with a trigger at the wrong time, I will have panic attacks that last multiple hours over simple school assignments. It's even been something as inconsequential as getting a 93% because ""is so low of an A that it barely counts, I basically got a B, I'm a terrible person and I'm never going to get into college or be happy ever at all."" My therapist brought up that the level of anxiety and perfectionism could be indicative of OCPD and that dreading tests for fear of inadequacy is definitely unhealthy.

That's all fine, clearly anxiety there. But with my level of alexithymia, unless I'm actively having a panic attack, I won't understand that the anxiety is to a level where it's unhealthy. It took at least four bad panic attacks before I even realized I was anxious. 

I'm trying to determine, though, if perfectionism and catastrophizing is only centered around my grades, and my anxiety is only situational, or if there's more going on. 



For those who skip backstory:

I'm stopped from things I enjoy because every activity leads back to death. Even when I was a child, it would fuel my actions, just in ways I couldn't describe. I never learned to bike because I would fall and die, or steer improperly into traffic and get hit by a car and die. I have similar scenarios for anything from escalators to riding a car. I can't get my driver's license because I get so nauseous and dread even sitting in the driver's seat. Socially, I plan out conversations and script what I'm going to say. I'm paralyzed when a room is silent and I need to talk, because I overthink how loud I am or how suddenly I speak or how to get up without moving ""wrong."" I've also been told this could be due to my undiagnosed neurodivergence. But none of this leads to extreme anxiety like my perfectionism and I don't have panic attacks from it at least yet. Apart from every bit of danger leading to harm or death, these are ""normal"" anxieties in my mind? 

This may be a really stupid question, but does that last paragraph sound debilitating? This question is ultimately helping me decide if I need a low dose of medication. The idea of me on meds seems a little distressing and I'd rather not unless my anxiety is to a point where it's hindering or harming me, which I can't tell.",1765628517.0,anxiety

1pljc8w,had a panic attack at 4am and convincing myself I'm almost near dea..,"so this happened last week. woke up at 4am with chest tightness, rapid heart beat ( to loud), couldn't breathe properly. immediately spiraled into ""this is it, i'm having a heart attack at 23.""

spent time in google (mistake #1) which told me i had pulmonary embolism and other more. by 8am i was ready to call an ambulance but also too broke and uninsured so just sat there having an mental crisis about whether i'd rather die or go into medical debt.

finally calmed down enough to realize it was probably just anxiety. but here's the thing - how are you supposed to know the difference between anxiety mimicking heart attack symptoms and actual heart attack when you're in the middle of it? google is useless. every symptom checker says go to the ER immediately.

i needed something that could actually help me figure out if what i was experiencing was dangerous or just my brain get over scared. 


anyway i didn't die obviously. but this whole experience made me realize i need better ways to handle these moments when they happen. can't keep spending every panic attack guessing if this is the one that's actually serious.

How to deal with this? Guys

Anyways, I’m curious to hear your longterm experiences with a weight neutral anxiety medication.

1pliw2b,I Trauma Dumped on a Stranger and it Led to Emotional Fallout and Public Humiliation (CW: Suicidal Ideation),"I (28F) was desperate for connection after losing my job and meeting this man (37M) in May while suicidal. We trauma-bonded and hooked up that night. Over the next months, I repeatedly pursued him despite his vagueness, driven by a deep need for validation. During a severe mental health crisis, I called him. He immediately said he was **not attracted to me** despite him asking me the next day after we hooked up to come back and two weeks before the fight he wanted me to come over and asked if I was seeking **attention**. When we met, he became aggressive, yelling, calling me ""annoying as f\*ck,"" revealing the hook-up was a drunken mistake, and walking out mid-crisis. It was because I kept asking for reassurance and wanting to hook up, which makes me feel like a creep. In shock, I posted the situation on the AWDTSG page because I needed some validation and support. Someone sent him a screenshot of the post and he then threatened me with a lawsuit, said very vile and hurtful things, called me a liar, and blocked me. However, the post revealed he has a history of emotional abuse, harassment, and an undisclosed STD. I am now consumed by regret, blaming myself for pursuing him, asking for reassurance, and posting the information, feeling like a stalker, predator, and manipulator.

1plikhy,Unsure what to do about a decision I made,"I bought an iPhone 17 last Sunday to replace my SE. I’ve been questioning whether it was worth the price of upgrading though, and have been thinking about returning the 17 and going back to my SE.

I've been weighing up the pros and cons:

\+: I could afford it. Still living at home, save money every month. 

\+: Battery and camera are better.

\-: I could put the money towards something better - e.g, a newer car, since mine fogs ups really badly. 

\-: I’m not a photagrapher; take more screenshots than pictures. And I got around the battery issues with my SE by using a power pack. 

\+/-: I’m interested in the iPhone Fold that is supposed to be coming out next year. Obviously no one knows what it’s going to be like though - could wait until September and it’s not very good, or doesn’t suit me.

But I'm also struggling with fear of my family: as I said, I’m still living at home. I feel like my mum and sister would disapprove of me returning it. It makes me anxious, and dissuades me from returning the phone. At the same time, I am aware that it is influencing me, and that feels wrong.

This has been playing on my mind a lot this week. Does anyone have any thoughts?

1pli5yo,Does anyone else with OCD feel “dumb” or mentally blocked when anxiety hits?,"Hi everyone, I’m wondering if others here experience something similar.

One of the most frustrating parts of my OCD is that when an intrusive thought appears, my anxiety spikes very quickly. When that happens, I don’t just feel anxious but mentally and verbally blocked. It feels like:

* I can’t think clearly
* I stumble over words when speaking
* my speech feels awkward or unnatural
* when typing or texting, every sentence feels “off”
* I make more typos or misspell words more easily
* I become hyper-aware of how I sound or write

It’s like anxiety temporarily shuts down my brain, and I start worrying that I look or sound stupid. So I’m curious:

* Does anyone else experience this cognitive/communication shutdown during OCD anxiety?
* If so, how do you cope with it in the moment?
* Have you found anything that helps long-term?

1plhyt5,"Two years of medication, five years of therapy… still at the same place.","This may be a bit odd post but I am looking for suggestions on what other approaches can I try. A bit of context before that:

Since I became a father I have crippling anxiety regarding the health of my children. Every time they get a fever I get panic attacks and severe anxiety. I also start showing obsessive behaviour such as checking temperature of my kids every 10 minutes when they are ill. I also get super worried taking to the doctor in fear that they might diagnose something serious. Interestingly the trigger for this behaviour is primarily fever. I don’t have a problem taking my kids to the dentist or worry so much for a physical injury. But a fever triggers a fear or unknown and lack of control and I spiral . Unfortunately young kids fall ill a lot as their immunity is developing so this has made life hell for me and family.

For last 5 years I have been seeking psychiatric help for this condition. I was put on SSRIs for two years which definitely helped and then the doctor weaned me off saying I only need therapy. I have been in therapy on and off for 5 years. I have gone through everything from - it is normal for parents to worry about their kids, to looking at childhood issues that can be causing such strong reactions. I have been practising cognitive behaviour therapy, meditation, spirituality everything, but nothing has brought any meaningful improvement.

Two different psychiatrists and therapists have said that I don’t need treatment anymore and I can manage. Unfortunately, as soon as one of the kids start coughing and the thermometer shows fever , all the anxiety, panic and crippling worry rushes back.

I am looking for advice if there are any alternate treatments I can try as the traditional methods have not brought any meaningful change? It’s really affecting my ability to function as a good father and I am already noticing my anxiety is rubbing off of my kids negatively. Personal life is hell as well and my wife is fed up.

1plgomg,Health anxiety spiral after one chest sensation – struggling to trust my body again,"Hi everyone,

I’m posting here because I feel completely stuck in a health anxiety loop and I really need to hear from people who’ve been through something similar.

About a month ago, I had one single episode during brief exertion where I felt a sudden chest sensation (very short, intense, scary). Since then, my anxiety has completely taken over.

I’ve had medical checks done (ECG, echocardiogram) and everything came back normal. Doctors reassured me. Logically, I know that should mean I’m okay.

But emotionally… I just can’t trust my body anymore.

Since that episode:
	•	I constantly scan my chest and breathing
	•	I feel random tightness, pressure, or discomfort (especially at rest or sitting at my desk)
	•	I’m afraid to go to work, afraid to move, afraid to exercise
	•	Any new sensation instantly makes me think “this is it”
	•	Even normal body feelings feel threatening now

What scares me the most isn’t the original episode anymore — it’s the feeling that my body could “surprise” me again without warning.

I recognize that this has turned into severe health anxiety / hypervigilance, and honestly it feels like an anxious burnout. I’m exhausted from being on alert 24/7.

I don’t think I’m looking for medical reassurance anymore. I think I’m looking for:
	•	People who had one trigger symptom and then spiraled
	•	How you learned to trust your body again
	•	How you stopped living in fear of sensations
	•	How you returned to work / normal life

Right now, even when I’m objectively “fine,” my anxiety is at a 10.

If you’ve been through this and came out the other side, I would really appreciate hearing from you.
Just knowing I’m not alone already helps.

I wake. Heart racing. I can’t breathe. Arms tingling. Hands Cold. Utter panic. This happens on a daily basis. I live in utter fear. I tried going to bed early today but after twenty minutes of sleep I awoke with my heart beating out of my chest. I’m beginning to fear my sleep. I’m beginning to fear living my life.

When I dream I am scared. I dream of death. The other night I dreamt I was trapped in a river under slabs of stone. The stones crush me. Squeezing the breath from my lungs. I slowly sink deeper into the water. I am going to drown. As soon as the water rises above my mouth and nostrils I awake. Total panic attack.

That was the most memorable dream of recent. I have these dreams all the time. 

I have panic attacks during the day as well. They used to happen everyday but as of December 13th, 2025, today, it has been four days.

I don’t want advice or anything, I just want to vent or talk to someone about this. 

I have health anxiety, also, I can’t leave my home alone without my partner being with me. I am having therapy, started with calls and now we’ve gone on to video, next month we are going to do in person.

For the last few days, I’ve had chest pain, on my right side, when I’m still, it doesn’t hurt, when I move, it hurts. Due to me thinking “oh no this is it, my heart is giving up”, it makes me panic, which then makes me feel dizzy, struggle to breathe to… have a panic attack. During these moments I worry even more that my breathing is caused by my heart. Which it more than likely isn’t.
My partner is away on work, but he’s coming back today and he’s taking me to the doctor/hospital just to be checked.

I just wish that I can go out the house, call the doctor and actually do these things without having to rely on my partner. 

I feel so silly about it. When I am a little calm (like now) I can think clearly. I haven’t slept, I’m worried if I sleep, I won’t wake up. As soon  as I lay down to sleep, I focus on any pain, or different movement in my body, that could be wrong with me.

apologies if this seems outlandish, but recently i’ve been having intense anxiety about leaving my room at night. i’ve always been afraid of the dark (mostly what possibly lurks within it), but for the past few years i’ve been doing pretty okay with being in the dark without having anxiety or intrusive thoughts. i’m pretty careful not to watch scary videos as it usually makes it worse (my downfall is having a genuine interest in horror but being too scared to fully enjoy it without repercussions). few incidents here and there but whatever. recently, i watched the five nights at freddy’s 2 movie. absolutely love the series and had a great time with it, but now every time i leave my room at night, my brain constantly tells me there’s an animatronic lurking in the guest room, or going to climb up the stairs. that it’s gonna come after me. it’s gotten so bad i can no longer go back in my room facing forward, i have to enter the room facing the hallway before i can close the door, just to confirm nothing is there. it’s 2 am currently as i write this, and i went downstairs to get water. i was constantly on alert, waving my phone flashlight around and checking my surroundings (i cannot turn on the lights as my dad is sleeping downstairs and isn’t too happy when he is disturbed) jokingly told myself i was playing fnaf 4 in real life but as i thought about it, it got real fast. even tried listening to some music and dancing but it didn’t seem to help. unfortunately, the anxiety doesn’t end when i enter my room, as i have thoughts about the animatronics opening my door, attacking me, and my cries of help going unheard. as it gets darker earlier and earlier, it gets more difficult to avoid it. will be addressing it with my therapist next session, but i wanted to share my experience here if anyone else has had a similar one, and if anyone has some helpful tips on how to tackle this.",1765610947.0,anxiety

I cannot hold down a job ever since I found out that my husband had been cheating on me a year ago. My anxiety is keeping me from wanting to go out and do things because if I'm not busy, I know what he's doing. 

It isn't that I don't want to go to work. I love the job that I have somehow managed to keep for the last 4 months. It's just that every time I wake up to get ready to go to work, my brain just shuts down and all of the what-ifs come to mind. 

Sometimes, it isn't even about him, though. For context, I lived in a different state with my husband for 7 years until early this year when we moved in with my parents in my hometown. While I lived away, my family back home would do things together without me. I missed a lot of things. It wasn't always their fault, but now that I'm back home with all of them, I don't want to miss out on anything. I don't feel close with anyone in my family anymore.

1plbys3,Sudden severe week-long anxiety,"A week ago my wife got a bit nervous about a (small) new thing at work, and I think she kind of “got in her head” about the nervousness/anxiety and has been anxious to the point of nausea/shaking/loss of appetite and sleep, all for a week straight. She says it’s not so much about the initial anxiety as it is the fact that if this little thing could trigger her, anything could trigger her. Maybe she’ll never be able to do all sorts of things ever again without this severe anxiety.

We went to a psychiatrist today who prescribed a “long term” med and an “as-needed” med (idk the details/names). I know it wasn’t Xanax because I asked for her to be prescribed Xanax and the doc didn’t want to. My thought is if she has this as-needed anxiety aid, her anxiety about having anxiety might go away.

Anyway, the as-needed meds don’t seem to be helping. She’s still anxious, shaking, and unable to sleep or eat properly.

Shes in therapy too. Which helps I think but she started therapy before this event.

Idk… need some advice I guess. I’ve just been hugging her and letting her cry for a couple hours every night. Idk what else to do except tell the doc she needs something stronger as-needed. 

Does anyone have a similar experience? Everything I google is about panic attacks that go away in 20 minutes which doesn’t apply here.",1765598157.0,anxiety
1plbuhb,Can't handle the dentist anymore and my teeth are dying.,"I have been cavity prone my whole life and I've had severe, irreversible dental decay for 5 years. I'm a smoker and I've had ARFID for 17 years. Due to my arfid I've been repeatedly getting new cavities every single year since I was a kid and I'm in my 20's now. I've had more fillings and root canals in my life than I can count but every single dentist appointment they are always finding new cavities that developed since my last appointment. I geniuenly can't remember the last time they said I didn't have any cavities. I also have a half grey tooth that has also been half grey since 2022. Despite it being pain free for three years, now all of a sudden it hurts like hell. Surprisingly, even though I still have a ton of cavities inside my whole mouth, none if my other teeth hurt. I currently have 10+ cavities. All throughout my mouth. Some of these cavities I got filled earlier this year and some I've had since 2022.  The smoking isn't helping either. I know unlike the arfid the smoking is my fault but thankfully I have nicotine patches and I'm hoping to be a non smoker again in a few weeks.
All my other teeth are still pain free. But my one half grey tooth is now suddenly hurting so bad it's making it hard to eat and talk. Whenever I move my cheek too high it hurts really bad. I have to make as minimal lip movement as possible when I eat or talk and I have to chew on the other side. If I accidentally chew on that side or accidentally move my mouth wrong while talking it hurts. I also have a hard time yawning so being tired or bored is kinda awful rn because whenever I yawn it inevitably hurts due to the cheek movement.

But the cheek movement just makes the pain worse to the point I'm visibly in pain. The pain is always there even when my mouth isn't moving at all its just mild without the cheek movement.

Clearly I need to go to the dentist and possibly even get this tooth extracted depending on how dead it is rn, but my dentist anxiety is so severe I cannot handle it and some dentists can't even handle it. Every time I've tried to go to the dentist at my most recent appointments, I shake and gag uncontrollably almost the entire time to the point where it's extremely embarrassing for me and makes it very hard for dentists to work on me because i can't stay still and gag whenever tools go in my mouth at certain angles. Dentists often have to wing it with limited dental x rays when deciding treatment for me because I can't get through even the x rays properly because I can't stop gagging when the chip enters my mouth. 

And then whenever they need to do an actual procedure, due to the uncontrollable tremor and senstive gag reflex I've had dentists have to stop the procedure early because they couldn't work on me. Only really good and really patient and really experienced dentists can finish a procedure on me and it's still hard for them to because they sometimes get slightly frustrated with me and keep telling me to try and control my breathing even though that clearly doesn't help. I actually got dropped by my local dentist because they couldn't complete even basic procedures on me and so I had to switch to a dentist 10 miles away since it's the second closest one that takes my insurance. 

I was put on laughing gas once but it actually made things even worse, because, I know this isn't a typical reaction so idk why I reacted this way to the nitrous, but for some reason the laughing gas masked the effects of the localized anesthesia so I felt the pain during the procedure and started crying. That was the only time I ever felt pain during a dental procedure, was when I was on laughing gas. So never again.
I was also still highly intoxicated as I was leaving. I seemed really drunk. The only reason they let me leave was because someone was with me. Most people begin to sober up the second they're taken off the mask but it didn't wear off for me until a full 30 minutes later. 

The localized anesthesia they inject into my mouth effectively blocks out any pain during any procedure so I typically do not feel any pain, so I'm never nervous about pain since I know it won't be that painful so that isn't what causes my tremors and gagging, it is purely just a physiological reaction to the sensory input. The sensory overload from the extremely loud and distressing noise of the tools right in my face make me begin to feel super anxious which then gives me the tremors. And the gagging is just because I have an extremely sensitive gag reflex. I gag when yawning or even when just brushing my teeth. It could play a part in my arfid because i will actually throw up when I taste something I don't like which is why I can't tolerate most foods or some medications. The fear of the nausea is what leads to me eating less than 10 foods and its almost all junk food and some of it is acidic or carbonated. Hence the repeated cavities i always get year after year. 

I've also tried noise canceling headphones but it doesn't work and then my headphones broke by having it on my neck for so many hours while I was out and so I had to get brand new headphones. 

So at this point, some dentists literally can't work on me because I'm just too difficult and I literally can't get through an appointment because everything about the reactions and dentists getting frustrated with me and the possibility of wasting my time taking the train to the dentist just to not even be able to get much done it all just gives me way too much anxiety. Since even laughing gas failed, there is absolutely no way to get through dental treatment except generalized anesthesia. I truly believe the only way me and most dentists will be able to do it now is if they just fully sedate me, if they fr just fully put me under so I don't negatively physically react anymore.

Unfortunately, this is not possible because my insurance won't cover it because they don't believe it's medically necessary and they only cover what they see is medically necessary. (and their version of medically necessary is, they literally only cover root canals on SOME teeth, not all, so I've had to settle for fillings on some teeth that need root canals because they will only cover root canals on some specific teeth and every other tooth they will only cover a filling or an extraction)

So yeah idk I just don't see any way I can go back to the dentist anymore. I'm so worried that I'm gonna end up with a horrible dental infection that gives me an abcess or spreads to my brain or something since I clearly cannot handle the dentist.",1765597784.0,anxiety

Week 2 I felt symptoms lifting slowly but surely. I was able to have a shower and just be present and not roam around in my thoughts and spiral. If I’m being honest the past 2 days have been hard as my parents have gone away for 2 nights. Maybe I’m out of routine? Not sure. I have moments where I feel horrible but then I have moments of clarity. I’m holding onto hope and I know that the medication and a physiologist will help me in the long run. Please give yourself grace this is such a hard thing to deal with. The medication in my system is still leveling out from what I have read it can take 4-8 weeks (or even up to 3 months) for you to really see the benefits.

On Monday I (28F) am moving into a new apartment with my cousin (29F). I’m not really anxious about the new living situation outside of knowing it will be an adjustment after living with my parents for the past year. What I am anxious about is the move itself. We are renting a 15’ U-Haul  that her dad will be driving. I have my furniture in a second floor storage unit. 

One thing that worries me is that I have a lot of boxes in the storage unit that I will have to move out of the way in order to get some of my furniture. Another part that worries me is that a lot of my furniture is heavy. Even though there will be at least 4 people able to help move furniture out of there (me, my cousin, her dad, my best friend), I’m worried about it taking a long time. 

The second thing I’m worried about is getting the furniture inside the new apartment. My desk is very awkward to get around corners and I have a sectional couch that’s really heavy.

1pl90ew,I need help to determine if I had a panic attack.,"I want to preface this by saying I haven’t ever had a panic attack before and so am completely unaware of the actual feelings or, I guess, process of it. 

But, here goes. 

Well. Firstly I felt very hot, this was the first thing I noticed when leaving my room as it was hot inside, I had my jacket and a jumper on and I could feel I was getting almost too hot and couldn’t cool down. Then, I felt a tightness in my chest whilst driving as I couldn’t cool down. 

Then I felt just like something was wrong, I can’t put my finger on it but something was wrong with me. And during this, it’s like something hit me, I became so crucially self aware of myself, almost like I was so aware that it became incredibly overwhelming. 

This felt like too much, followed by my - I think usual chest pains which doctors claim to be lactic acid (very likely) - which then caused, like a pulsating through my body, like I was trying to jump out of my skin, like my body was trying to be extremely quickly sick, like it was trying to jump out of me (whilst not really being incredibly nauseous) and this pulsating jumped through my body a few times before I called my partner. 

Speaking, I felt like I struggled to speak, like my words weren’t very clear and my voice was shaky. I had this for about 10 minutes during my drive to boots chemist to check this out (as it was on the way to where I was driving) But, during all of this I just felt like something was very very wrong with me. I can’t really explain that feeling. 
And that feeling of something wrong with me felt like it was going to be a heart attack (I’m only 27, how daft) I also felt like I was going to faint, however I haven’t fainted before so I don’t know what that feels like, so it may not have been that. 

It’s taken me a good 6-7 hours to feel relatively normal again. 

It’s just the pulsating felt like my body was about to slump. I can’t remember much else, but that fear I’m struggling to forget. Since then I’ve had a pain in my left chest. But I usually have a sort of pain like I mentioned with lactic acid.

All of this is quite hard to put into words, so I’m just sort of confused with what happened to me. 

Oh, I should mention, it also seems to have been brought on by flicker of rain on my windshield, it was raining so, so lightly and it was almost as if these freckles of rain were overwhelming me, like there was such a heavy focus on them that I couldn’t get away from. Again, I can’t really explain it. The hyper awareness sort of brought that on.

I don’t have panic attacks, I’ve never had one, never fainted and I’m confused.

If anyone can help it would actually mean a lot.

I've been doing well enough, made normal ""friendships"" with my coworkers and say hi to management but that's about it. 

Well a few months ago they brought in more management and supervisors, and they liked me and promoted me to fill another supervisor roll. 

So now I'm being trained for that and I realize my  anxiety may be making me appear less confidant than I'd like. I don't remember how I handled it when I first started but now I am hyper aware of never knowing what to do with my hands, I find myself playing with my necklace/rings/hair, clasping and unclasping my hands, etc as my manager is training me. 

  
I just think it must be super obvious at a glance that I'm anxious and nervous or even worse because two of the managers are men, I'll be seen by them or my coworkers as like? Flirting?

i was prescribed propranolol to take daily or as needed and it definitely helps. the fear of having a panic attack in public has started to snowball into agoraphobia, making it hard for me to go to work/appointments/hangouts in fear of a health scare.

everything i see about agoraphobia says the only way out is through – you have to teach your body that you are safe and the physical sensations are just sensations, and you will overcome it through exposure. 

if i'm taking propranolol when i'm anxious, is this just enabling the idea that i'm unsafe and need to be calmed down? it helps so much but i don't want to rely on it forever or teach my body that i need medication to go outside.

It triggers me and I have to calm myself. May take a minute or a whole day/night. Last time it happened, I was playing a game and I didn't sit right on my chair so I had pain on my shoulder. Went to my left arm. So much fun.

I went to a doctor. We talked. We did two tests (blood testing and X-rays). Everything is fine. Heart rate, top shape. So we decided to use a bigger dose of Citalopram (from 20 to 40). I feel so much fine, but heartburn and I spend my day burping lol so i'm using a new medication for my acidity.

1pl49vq,White coat syndrome,"Okay, I haven’t posted in a while. Honestly, my anxiety has been quite manageable with therapy. I’ve shared my story here before, but basically, I had a baby in August 2024 and developed preeclampsia, which led to chronic hypertension. Now, every time I get my blood pressure checked, it spikes because I have PTSD. I had my annual wellness exam today with my doctor. I had my labs yesterday, and everything looks good. Of course, when they took my blood pressure, it spiked, and it wouldn’t come down even when my doctor took it. They took it 3 times. My reading was 142/76. The bottom number is good. I tried telling him I’m just really anxious (I mean, my heart rate was 120). He said we could add another blood pressure medication, but I definitely don’t want that. I’m already on the middle dose of Valsartan, and I find myself getting lightheaded on it sometimes. Does anyone have any tips on how to get calmer readings? I was so worked up that even box breathing didn’t help me. Its also not even just going to the doctors, it tends to spike just having the cuff on my arm, even at home.

1pl3t7h,It'll Pass <3,"Hey everyone

Approx 2 years ago i had a really bad weed induced anxiety (or panic i am not sure tbh) attack and was convinced i was having a heart attack and that i was about to die. (I've never had anxiety/panic attack before until that time). I developed a fear about having heart attack after that day. Whenever my heart rate increased even a tiny bit, my whole focus would shift to my chest. I'd check my bpm several times a day, my hands would get sweaty all the time, couldn't focus on anything etc it sucked real hard. After the cardiologist visit and wearing a holter for 2-3 days i was certain that it was pyschological. From that day on i kept telling myself it's all in your head you won't die today every time i felt bad (Btw after that anxiety attack i realized i was also afraid of death and that's something i still work on today internally. In my case it wasn't about just my heart)

Today i realized it's been around a year since i last worried about my heart. (and i can smoke again without my heart going crazy) During that time i was seeking comfort from here occasionally by reading what other people are going through so maybe this'll comfort someone: It's a temporary situation and it'll pass. First you need to eliminate the physical conditions and considering you are probably an average young person, trust me it's really unlikely you to die from a heart attack. Don't let it control your life, try to observe as it happens. Just observe don't react. You know it's all in your head so there is no need to feed that negative loop. Don't try to run away from it either. It's a part of you that you need to work on it. Even though it's said easier than done with time it gets easier

It'll take different time for everyone since everyone is different but i assure it'll pass one day

Also little side note, before all of that i thought people were exaggerating it about anxiety/panic attacks and i was thinking them as weak people. Oh boy was i wrong lol",1765575171.0,anxiety
1pl3moi,How can I tell when my symptoms are anxiety and when something is medically wrong with me?,"I may be wording this poorly, but I’m not sure how else to ask. I’ve been diagnosed with panic disorder for just over a year now, and while it’s gotten easier as I learn more about my symptoms, I can’t help but stress that something else may be really wrong with me every time they occur.

One of my main symptoms is brain fog/dizziness, and it shows up seemingly out of nowhere. I can be having a pretty normal day, and then I get a little dizzy, and suddenly I’m convinced something must be very wrong, and then I start panicking and having other symptoms. Other things I get like shivering, numbness, and tingling are all definitely unpleasant, but feel manageable to me, and on their own don’t lead to a full on panic attack (although they usually occur once I’m already having one). 

One of my other issues is food. I know this one is pretty common, but my appetite and my anxiety have a very odd relationship. Sometimes, I won’t have any anxiety until I’ve eaten a full meal, and then once I feel full for some reason I feel afraid, like I might get sick. Sometimes, I eat and my stomach feels indescribably strange, like I can somehow feel the food I just ate in my stomach. The best I can describe it is as if I can feel my digestive process (I know I can’t, I definitely got some odd looks from doctors by saying that). Sometimes, I avoid eating because I’m afraid of these feelings, so I get dizzy, and I already talked about how that goes.

I just wanted to know if anyone else has these symptoms/worries. I know health anxiety is huge for so many people here, and I’ve definitely experienced my fair share of overthinking my symptoms and fearing I may be dying or sick. But one of my biggest issues is that dizziness and stomach issues are both symptoms of so many other serious illnesses, and I’m afraid I’ll never know for sure if I’m just having my normal anxiety, or if something really is wrong. I’m also worried my diagnosis will always be a way for doctors to brush aside my concerns and not take me seriously. Having anxiety doesn’t necessarily mean I there isn’t something else going on, and I just wanted to know if anyone else has had any luck differentiating between what is being caused by anxiety and what needs to be seen by a doctor.

But everyday I get a small anxiety attack before I clock into work. I don't know why, I work at a decent place and get along with my coworkers, I have no reason to be anxious 

but then again, it wouldn't be a disorder if it was rational

What I've been doing is going to the bathroom before my shift so I can shake it off. Literally, I lock myself in a stall and I shake my arms and flap my hands to get it out of my system. It works most of the time 

I find that pacing and physical movement helps release that anxiety, while sitting in place makes it fester and get worse, so I pace and wring my hands a lot

Sometimes I have to hold my face and verbally tell myself, out loud, ""You're fine, you're literally fine,"" and that often snaps me out of whatever spiral I'm in.

1pl3aq5,Extreme anxiety around over consumption/consumerism,"I honestly don’t know where this anxiety comes from but I’ve had it since I was an adult and it keeps getting worse and worse older I get. I have extreme anxiety about over consuming or buying things that I don’t need or use “enough”. It causes extreme decision paralysis for me that makes me spiraling to overthinking before I can make a simple purchase. 

One big example for me is shoes. I’m trying to learn how to dress better and find my personal style. Right now the only shoes I own are two pairs of sneakers, a work shoe and a snow boot. I want to buy more shoes so that I can style my outfits more intentionally but when I think about a pair of shoes I might like I start getting really freaked out and worrying about what if I don’t wear them enough? What if they only go with a couple of my outfits and I only wear them one or two times a month? Logically I know that even if I’m not wearing them all that often I’m still using them and they’re not a waste. But emotionally it feels like if I’m not using something constantly all the time then I’m wasting it insulation shouldn’t even bother getting something unless I’m absolutely certain I’m going to use it all the time.

The thing I’m worried so much about right now is a water bottle. I just ordered a new bag which I know that I need because right now the only bag I have is a tote and the inside pocket broke and it’s starting to fall apart. But the problem is that I don’t think the bag is big enough to fit my 24 ounce water bottle on top of everything else I need to fit. So then I’m like maybe I need to buy a 16 ounce water bottle which will fit in the bag better. But then I think to myself that if I use the 16 ounce bottle in the bag all the time that I’m never gonna use the 24 ounce water bottle and then I’m being wasteful. 

It’s like every single thing that I bought I had to think through every scenario which I might use it and make sure that I’m gonna be “enough” but by some arbitrary standard. Honestly, I just get anxious thinking about how much stuff there is on this earth that no one needs or uses and I think I internalize it too much. But I don’t know how to make it stop.

Anxiety symptoms (for 4+ years):
Past health anxiety (convinced myself normal things were serious illness)
Physical anxiety symptoms (chest pain/heart aches that doctors said were anxiety)
Excessive worry I can't control
Sometimes feel like everyone is against me/attacking me (even though I know it's not real)


Mood/emotional issues:
Extreme mood swings when studying - go from really happy/energetic when I solve a problem to intense self-hatred when I fail one
My mood is heavily affected by weather (cloudy days = feel bad)
Swing between feeling ""gifted"" and feeling like ""a fool""


Existential/time issues:
Constantly pre-grieve things before they're over (can't enjoy good moments because already sad about losing them)
Time passing causes me real psychological pain
Can't account for where months of my time have gone - like I was there but don't remember what I did
Sometimes sit for long periods just thinking about how sad I'll be in the future


The concerning part:
When I fail at things or get very frustrated, I have thoughts about wanting to ""exit from life"" - not plans or intent, but the feeling happens regularly
Sometimes feel like life is meaningless/not worthwhile


Study/function issues:
Extreme difficulty starting tasks even when I desperately want to (can sit for hours unable to begin)
When I do study, can only get through small amounts because I keep ""drifting"" - doing nothing and not conscious of it
Have periods of ""mindless drifting"" throughout the day


Background:
About 18 months ago I wrote notes about needing help for anxiety but didn't go
Early 2024 had a really bad period - working in isolated conditions, constant anxiety, felt like ""hell""
Things improved in spring, felt better, thought I was fine
Now (winter again) symptoms are back and affecting my ability to study for important exams


Once convinced myself I had GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) but never got diagnosed.

This guy used it to threat me or make a joke out of it in August 2024 (I was aged 15). By this supposed 'joke' he made out the video, he had sent it in a groupchat with my old 'friends' and laughed about it. Sure, that was fine as others I used to hang out with had said such horrible things and thought it was funny. However, from the day I was informed he had this it sent off a stress alarm in my body from the potential threat of people seeing it and sparking violence against me or being cancelled etc.

Therefore, I was stressed about it CONSTANTLY for 8 months straight from August 2024 - May 2025. I struggled to sleep, cried a TON, got sunken eyebags severly etc. I live in the UK so this type of thing can have serious repercussions.

DISCLAIMER - I am extremely sorry for saying this. I have developed and am now 17 and understand the total disgusting nature of using such a term.

However, things took a turn for the best, when I stopped thinking about it in May. I got amazing Year 12 results in my A-level mocks.

But, the stress from this video even though he last brang it up a year+ ago has came back in September at the start of the school year 2025 to haunt me - subken eyebags purplish tint, bloated face, some acne which I never had before making me super upset and doubt the worth of life anymore. This stress showed from panic attacks in class, could not study at home etc.

I am in my final year of High School now and really need to meet my target grades of all A's which big uni's have the perception of me achieving when I applied to them. Thus, such a video interfering in my life feels totally overwhelming.

1pkx4qg,Best supplements for daytime anxiety?,"For context, I have been struggling on and off with anxiety for the past several months. I get these days where I just feel constant fear. It has no obvious trigger (it's not like I'm nervous about anything coming up later that day, -- I just feel uncomfortable and scared for no clear reason). It's made it difficult for me to function at work since I struggle to just sit still.

In the past I used alcohol to self-medicate for this. I was taking shots throughout the day just to keep myself at bay, but this eventually resulted in me getting a detox and going sober.

So what supplements would you recommend for me to use to just feel calmer? I've tried CBD & CBG, valerian root, and ashwagandha pills. And while these do help, it's only mild. Is there something I'm missing out on? Are there specific forms of the aforementioned supplements that are best?

1pkw5mp,Driving anxiety returned after accident,"I’ve struggled with severe driving anxiety resulting in me only getting my license this past summer at age 26. Shortly after I got a job that requires a half hour commute on the highway. There is no public transit option. I was doing it and things were going pretty well until we had our first real snowfall of the season. It was that sort of weather where the snow is half sticking half melting. I’m still not entirely sure what exactly happened, but on a bend in the road at highway speeds I lost control of my car. It slid left, then right, then left again across the oncoming lane of traffic and into the ditch. Thank god no one was hurt, nothing was hit, and my car wasn’t even damaged. However the ditch was too steep to drive out of so I had to call for a winch. 

In the moment itself I was actually pretty calm, but the aftermath is that this has destroyed my confidence in driving. What fucks me up is that a) I still don’t really know what caused me to lose control like that, and b) things could have been so much worse. Braking had zero effect until I was off the road in the ditch, which was grassy. I lost control of my car. It was only luck that no other cars were around to be hit. Thank god no one was hurt and my car wasn't even damaged. I missed work that day but had to go in the next. The whole day I felt like I was falling apart, like no one understood or cared how scared I was and how hopeless I feel. However taxing I found regular driving, winter driving is 1000x worse. I’ve gone back to asking my parents to ride with me because I’m afraid of doing it by myself and I absolutely hate losing that independence. I hate that independence requires driving but that’s another rant for another post. 

I’ve made peace with the fact that most of my anxieties are irrational. Like, being afraid of talking on the phone is objectively pretty silly and I can accept that. But driving is something that seems completely rational to fear and this incident has only reinforced it. In this instance I feel like I’m the sane one and it’s everyone else who’s crazy. Why are people okay with piloting around giant hunks of metal at high speeds when it objectively leads to thousands of accidents and injuries every year? Why do people just accept this as part of life?? I genuinely do not understand it. The only advice people give me is to get back on the road. How? Every time I start feeling confident in myself, that’s when things go wrong.",1765556735.0,anxiety
1pkw0qa,had my first anxiety attack in years this week,"post title is pretty much the TLDR. I had my first ‘proper’ anxiety attack in 10+ years this week and now I’m worried that I might be regressing. 

tw: mention of emetophobia (fear of vomit/being sick)

I got some last-minute theatre tickets with my family, and on the day of I woke up feeling a little nervous about it. this was a familiar feeling as the theatre has been a big trigger for me in the past - I think it’s something about the sense of feeling ‘trapped’ and like I can’t easily get out if I wanted to. I have also struggled with emetophobia in the past, so there is also an element of worrying about feeling a need to be sick, and not being able to get to a bathroom in time.

I tried to push the anxiety away, but as the day went on I started feeling worse, and by the time I made it to my seat that evening I could feel my heart going a million miles an hour. I tried sipping on a bottle of water and practising deep breaths, but nothing was helping. eventually the nerves became outright panic and I didn’t even make it to the end of act 1 before practically bolting from my seat (thankfully our row was quite empty, so I was able to get out quickly). 

some staff members responded very quickly to check on me while I was hiding in the bathroom, and I told them what had happened, and they were very kind and offered to get me some water and a different seat nearer to the exit. I reunited with my family at the interval and they were really worried, asking if I wanted to go home, but I brushed them off and assured them I was okay. I did move to a seat at the end of the row, and thankfully was able to finish watching the show, but the experience has nonetheless really rattled me. 

as I said in the first paragraph, I have not experienced such intense anxiety symptoms in at least 10 years. back in February I went to a different theatre production and sat right in the middle of a sold-out show, with next to no legroom either side of me, and was absolutely fine. back in September I did experience something similar on a plane as we were approaching to land, again with that anxiety about feeling ‘trapped’ in my seat/fear of being sick meaning I had to wake up the person sat next to me to make another dash to the bathroom to calm down. 

I am now really worried that this anxiety is going to become an issue for me again. it nearly ruined my life before, I could barely get on a bus or a train without feeling panic. I fought like hell to get past it back then, and I have absolutely zero idea what might be bringing it back now. 

does anyone have any advice on what I might be able to do to prevent further attacks, or if there might be some deeper psychological thing I need to work through? I have been feeling quite tense recently due to stress at work, plus tensions with my family meaning that home doesn’t feel like a relaxing environment, so I wonder if this could be a manifestation of that.

for this reason, i’ve finally decided to seek support, after being persuaded by my family.
our first meeting took place and went well. but i have a problem. they asked me to also see a psychiatrist and use medication to help me during our therapy sessions.
i used antidepressants before when i was younger for other reasons, and i know how many warnings are in their prospectus.
just because of this, i’m afraid that even a medication that could help me might harm me, or that if i have a heart problem and the medication makes it worse, or a sudden problem might arise, so i can’t start the medication.

A week later, Tom and I spent a whole day sailing together. It went really well. Afterward he texted me saying he really enjoyed the day and that I made him laugh. I got very excited but also extremely wired and couldn’t sleep for two days.

He invited me sailing again with other people and later invited me to his place to cook. He was very sweet with me, like puting his hands on my knees but at the end of the group sailing day I felt insecure because he seemed to look at the other woman a bit more, but at the end he kissed me again and texted me later.

We cooked together again at his place, had fun, and kissed. I asked about the girl from the party, and he told me he stopped seeing her after our first sailing day and deleted dating apps. He also told me personal things about his past relationship, his family, and his mental health. May I mentioned we had quite a lot of wine that night.

We eventually slept together, in the morning, a bit more sober. After that I felt anxious and left quickly. Three days later, he invited me over because he was sick and I brought him an infusion. I felt awkward and self-conscious during that visit. When things got more sexual I told him I didn’t feel in the mood. He said he wasn’t looking for something casual.

Think those symptoms have subsided, but my anxiety has been PEAKED ever since to the point where my fatigue and racing thoughts have been debilitating. Pacing, loss of appetite, inability to focus, withdrawing from family and friends, not because I want to, but because I’m just so on edge and anxious and my body feels constant fight or flight.

If you have seen my previous posts (they are still there if not) you will be able to see that my anxiety started a few weeks ago now and the physical symptoms have ruined my life.

I have been to the doctors 7 times and the hospital 3 times, they all told me the same thing. I’m perfectly healthy, I’m manifesting the symptoms due to my anxiety.

I have now registered with a new doctor and my first appointment was today (I also went to the hospital 3 days ago).

My new doctor told me that with his patients he will read through their history, but he likes to get to know them and judge from that.

The second I told him my symptoms he told me that my vitamin D is extremely low (17) and that I need to start the strongest tablets today.

He then did my blood pressure standing and sitting and told me I need to go straight to the hospital because of how low it is (even though every time I’ve been to the hospital and doctors they have not mentioned this once) i obviously started freaking out but was relieved someone finally was listening.

Luckily he was able to access my x ray from a few days ago and could see that my lungs and heart are working fine, but was concerned about organ failure.

I need an urgent cortisol blood test and have had an urgent referral put through for a cardiologist and have been told if I faint, I need to ring 999 straight away.

I know with anxiety especially health anxiety it’s hard to know whether you are manifesting this physically or if there is actually something wrong.

But PLEASE if ANYONE is not 100% certain and you do not feel like yourself, go to the doctor or go to the hospital and if they dismiss you, change doctors.

This isn’t to scare anybody as luckily this is really fixable with tablets, but the fact this could have been solved 7 weeks ago rather than me get worse is crazy.

1pksmd5,You didn’t waste that year,"I saw some posts about regretting ""wasting"" time being anxious, and fearing that when you look back, you’ll realize you never truly lived during what should have been your best years.

My first thought reading it was: Why do we always look back and blame the person who was already doing her best?

When we grow and reach a new level of understanding, it’s easy to feel disconnected from who we used to be. But don’t judge her. That younger self—that person—was doing everything she could with the knowledge and tools she had at the time. She was surviving.

I used to see the college entrance exam as more important than life itself. Back then, everything around me—family, school, society—was telling me exactly that. I didn’t have the awareness to question it, let alone push back.

Now I understand because I’ve grown. I’ve left my hometown, seen more of the world, read more, watched more stories that moved me.

But I would never say to the girl who stayed up until 4 a.m. every night from anxiety, who sometimes needed medication just to get through the day—I would never tell her, “You were wasting your time.”

Instead, I want to say:
Look how far I’ve come from that place. I am so much stronger than I knew. And I’m really proud of her—proud of me.

We don’t move forward by criticizing who we were. We move forward by thanking her for enduring, and by loving who we’re becoming.

A while ago I watched a movie about dissociative identity disorder, and after that I started worrying that I might have it too. Eventually I managed to calm myself down and let that thought go.
But then another intrusive idea came: what if my personality could just disappear and I would be left as an “empty shell”? I also managed to dismiss that one.
But then a third thought showed up — something like: what if I disappear completely? What if in this multiverse version of reality I suddenly stop existing?
And since then I’ve been stuck in this loop of:
“What if I disappear right now? …Now? …Now?”
It gives me intense anxiety and even physical discomfort.

so i hope that’s fine. this will also be highly anecdotal, purely because i have no other way to put it.

i feel like i take this too literally. funnily enough these feelings we’re brought to light via a ‘the onion’ title i saw on youtube about a girlfriend calling cold temperatures “sweater weather” while people die. and it made me think: is this not exhausting for everyone else? 

i’m not sure when exactly i decided to take the phrase literally. i believe it was somewhere in middle school when i’d first started seeing social media content about certain things people do that make them mad and piss them off, topped off with content regarding advocacy/activism (not speaking politically) nowadays, which i know is selfish to say. it got debilitating for me, to the point that i couldnt do anything with my life. a “how would you feel if you were (ex: homeless)” turns into “i will be homeless. how will i prepare for being homeless. i cannot prepare for being homeless i will likely die. im dying right now im dying in a house fire someones coming to kill me you should really check that door! what do you mean you can’t get up you’re gonna die??? why cant you move you’re gonna die!!!”

and this is the problem. i feel bad for people, and i dont feel their feelings, i feel their danger?? and if i dont then i feel incredibly bad for not feeling it all the time because it means that i dont care, something ive seen echoed by other people. this is funny, because there’s no way that they DONT turn it off with the way they act or the things they participate in. it sucks because the main way to combat issues i feel strongly about, for example homelessness; is to help people firsthand, it also involves regularly hearing and seeing horrible things and to be tapped into that all the time and i cant do it. it brings me back to the catalyst, the article,  the punchline (in comparison to their other ones/ usual form of comedy) seems to be that the escapism/enjoyment of the mundane when other horrible things are happening is at fault instead of, you know, everything else. dont they HAVE to turn it off? it only confirmed that i have to be in that headspace all the time. always. 

it’s also gone into my personal life. i feel as if i cant speak to my mother because she always has another horrible story or is watching some true crime documentary or something and i know its harmful but i cant say anything. i feel as if i can’t connect with people because as someone into heavier things, i cant do shock value. it makes me almost lose respect for people/things, which is funny because that makes them lose respect for me also. even when i put that aside i cant watch horror movies for example with my friends because then all i can think of “oh no thatd hurt. i have an axe in my head. im dying. im dying turn this off why does nobody care people die all the time why does nobody care that people die all the time someone has surely died like this, right?” SURELY THEY HAVE TO TURN THIS OFF? scratch that, THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO TURN THIS OFF, RIGHT?? and if they dont why dont think think of people who think in extremes? isnt that contradictory? anyways ive been rambling for too long sorry if this is incomprehensible.

1pkortv,Anxiety and eye strain dizziness,"Just wondering if anyone can shed some light. 3 months ago after an emotionally traumatic experience and a tremendous amount of crying my eyes were strained to the point that I couldnt watch TV or look at my phone without it being uncomfortable and causing a headache. This also came with pain when moving eyes and feeling all the muscles from my eyes all the way to the back of my head move when I moved my eyes. So sometimes I'd feel dizzy with the sensation especially when I sat down it would come with head pressure. 

So after a week could watch TV again and look at my phone but as the weeks went on and anxiety got worse I noticed I still couldn't read without feeling dizzy or highly uncomfortable. Anyway I went down the root of trying to find a cause, blood tests, ct scan prism glasses (slight misalignment) but these are my symptoms and its driving me to severe depression if anyone could relate to give some piece of mind. 

Waking up with severe tension in my entire head neck and scalp and scalp burns

Eye strain from the minute I wake up to the minute I sleep

Cant focus on anything still for more than a few seconds without feeling pulling in my eyes head and body, almost feeling light wanting to go cross-eyed and lightheaded 

Neck pain and burning in the neck

Standing still sometimes feel swaying

No blurred vision but sometimes dry sensation.

Pain in back of head

Also just to note I do have tmj and grind my teeth in my sleep with the stress

I started low dose sertraling 25mg 6 days ago im the hopes it will help me relieve the symptoms if its all anxiety. 

My main worry is not being able to focus my vision on anything without it pulling and dizzy. 

Also even though I've got small prism prescription that I've had for 2 weeks symptoms were there before but not as bad and symptoms decrease sometimes when im relaxed and not anxious

1pkolwb,I Overcame Debilitating Public Speaking Anxiety and Survived a 30-Minute Presentation,"I (27M) have always had an irrational fear of public speaking/presentations. Ever since I was in school, I would go to extreme lengths of making up excuses/faking sick to skip presentations or any form of public speaking. 

  
This stemmed from early horrifying experiences of public speaking. When I had no choice but to present, I would find myself completely frozen. My face would turn red, lips would start quivering and my facial muscles would stiff up severely (the worst!). 

  
This would even happen during social situations if I'm caught off guard for a mini speech or if the spotlight was suddenly on me. For presentations, I wouldn't be able to look anyone and I'd end up reading off slides with my back faced towards the audience. 

  
Funnily enough, I was able to mostly work in remote roles early on in my career. Even when I had to go to office and present, it would typically be in a low-stakes catch up meeting with less than 10 people. It wasn't nerve-wrecking as I'd present while seated with the rest of the team, which made it feel less intimidating. 

  
Fast forward to this year, I was asked to deliver a 2-minute demo in front of my entire company (100-ish) during our townhall. The first time they made me do it, I got so nervous I made up a ridiculous excuse and got a colleague to cover. 

  
I knew this wouldn't be sustainable so I prepared myself for the next couple of townhalls. Stumbled upon propranolol while researching on ways to combat anxiety and was able to pull through. The presentations were very short, just a couple of minutes and both times, I had someone to present with. I remember the first one going great because I addressed the crowd directly without feeling nervous. The second time felt somewhat scary but I could still do it. I took roughly 30-40mg of propranolol both times. 

  
Fast forward to recent events, I was asked to present for 30 mins in a company-wide event. The moment I found out, it completed killed me. I've NEVER done this before. I spent the next month leading up to the event debating whether to do it. Couldn't focus on anything, it was all I ever thought about. How on earth was I going to present for 30 minutes in front of so many people? 

  
Somehow, I psyched myself to do it, out of fear of being found out. On the day of the event, I considered strongly whether to still continue as my anxiety was debillitating. However, I felt it was too late to pull out. As soon as I stepped into my office, the fear paralysed me. I was so, so, incredibly close to just walking straight back out and going home with an excuse of feeling unwell. However, I knew deep down, avoidance would just grow this fear to the point of no potential return. 

  
I should mention that I took 60mg of propranolol (highest dose yet) to get me through this. Yet, it only helped with the physical symptoms so my mind was still racing. Somehow, by God's grace, I decided to just go up there when it was my turn. To my surprise, it went a whole lot better than I expected. 

  
I absolutely killed it, adding points which I didn't have during my practice runs. Making light jokes & engaging with the audience. It was as if the anxiety just dissipated within the first 30 seconds. I'm very certain propranolol helped because it's usually the physical symptoms that send my nerves to the extreme. 

  
By the end of it, I got a solid applause and compliments on my presentation skills. Everyone thought I was a natural which is insane considering I've barely ever presented in my life in front of that many people. If I could impart some key takeways from my experience, it would be: 

  
1) If I can do it, so can you. Trust me, my fear was irrational beyond belief. 

2) Propranolol is a game-changer. My HR is usually in the 100s during these things, it stabilised between 60-80 this time. 

3) Practice, practice, practice. This definitely made me feel confident in pushing through. ",1765535235.0,anxiety

1pko0yy,I feel like anxiety is ruining my relationship,"We have been dating for a year now. Once we started dating did I realise by her example how important it is for me to heal from my past traumas, and start fixing my toxic habits. I have been mentally healing for over a year and its taking a bad toll on the relationship and her, and I dont dare to bring it up anymore. 

In the first half was I the one helping her heal. Heal from eating disorder, anorexia, and depression. She took a good half a year to heal up, even though she says she started her journey years ago and I was just a boost in the recovery. 
Me, I started healing my anxiety and insomnia I got around my matura exams that I still have. For half a year now. And I dont feel close to recovery. I always feel anxius, and because of that I gained insomnia. A very bad one. I was terrified to go to sleep for months and only could calm down by accepting her help and support. Something I got too used to. Something I rely on too much nowadays even if Im not doing too bad. 

I tried to bring it up and talk it out with her, because I know its toxic. I tried to find solutions with her, but we always had the same conclusion:
Im just a random 19 year old over stressed and worried, and once I go to university and settle down, I will be okay again, and its completely normal that I rely on help I never got and refused before. Which is something I get and also hate. Im constantly worried it will ruin the relationship. Im constantly worried it will ruin her, no matter how patient she is. She visibly gets bothered whenever I bring it up and gets very sad saying ,,she feels like she doesnt love me enough when I say things like that"". Things like: Im afraid my anxius behavior will ruin what we have, or Im afraid my anxiety make her unattracted to me. Whenever I decide to take things in my hand, do my work alone, sleep without call, not tell her if something bothers me she gets incredibly sad because its like,,I dont trust her anymore"", which isnt true. She also spends every other week over at my place, which again, makes me worried she doesnt actually want to come over and spend time with me because of my anxiety and it slowly makes her unattracted of me and fall out of love. She also been coming over everyother week because its bad for the both of us to only see eachother for one or two days only on the weekends

Ironically, I’m having anxiety about taking Xanax. I’ve always had anxiety about taking ANY medication, I had a traumatic experience as an infant where I had to be restrained to be worked on. Of course they fed me pain meds and all kinds of stuff because this was due to the tip of my finger being cut off. I guess subconsciously this messed me up somehow, so now I really struggle with taking any medications. Given the anxiety I already have around any medication, on top of that I know all of the stigma around benzos and how they can be highly addictive. I totally know I sound irrational, but I have anxiety what can I say? My mind tells me what if I become dependent? What if I have a bad reaction? Is my anxiety even bad enough for this? Should I wait until my anxiety attack is severe before I take one?

I know I’m not the only one with anxiety around taking benzos and I guess I’m just looking for some advice and support. For those that take any benzo, do you take it regularly or only on your high anxiety days? What is your personal threshold for when you know “okay I need it now”?

It has caused me such bad health anxiety wondering if it's just anxiety and acid reflux, which I've always had health anxiety but never this bad. The first 4 days straight I thought I was dying, I've been in the hospital like 5 times during all this and it's only been 11 days.

I’m 23 now, I have a stable job, own apartment with my fiancé, my degree, and overall I’m doing fine in life… except when it comes to making friends. That part has always been a struggle for me.

I do have a few friends (met through my fiancé and one at work) My fiancé is supportive of me trying to put myself out there more and tagging along sometimes. But part of me wants to learn how to do things on my own and build confidence that way. How do you meet new people?? I don’t know where to start but,

I recently started a “bucket list” of things that scare me or make me anxious, just to push myself. I’ve already done a couple, and it actually felt good. I’m even thinking about trying a rave next summer or fall, just for the experience and to figure out who I am again.

I think I kind of lost myself focusing so much on school and work. I didn’t make friends in college, which still gets to me sometimes. There’s even a part of me that wonders if getting a master’s would give me another chance socially, even though I know that’s not the best reason to go back to school.

I know I can be outgoing once I warm up, reading social cues and starting conversations (overthinking everything) This is where I am lost. I’m currently in therapy to figure myself out.

If anyone has been in a similar place, how did you make friends as an adult?

1pkkgnj,Mental health counseling only helpful over the short term?,"Hello everyone,

I am 25M in the USA with Autism(similar in severity to what was once known as Asperger's) and Generalized anxiety disorder. I've had both of these conditions since I was a kid. I am seeking some input here from my fellow Reddit users.

I have a somewhat troubling history with mental health counseling also known as ""talk therapy"" that I'm wondering if others can relate to.

I have this problem where I will utilize ""talk therapy"" for several sessions due to my anxiety issues, complete the program and then ""relapse"" back to feeling anxious within a few years of completing the program. I have attended therapy programs on four different occasions with four different therapists and have had the same end result with all of them. I will provide a few examples below

Therapist #1(2012): I worked with a therapist for a summer at age 12. I felt less anxious after completing the program but by spring of 2013 my anxiety symptoms had returned. This was the year I started middle school and I had also been forced to discontinue my anxiety med at age 11 due to health issues so not as certain with this particular instance.

Therapist #2(2015): I worked with a therapist for several months during 2015(age 14/15 for me). I did really well with this program but by the end of 2015 I had fallen back into rather significant anxiety and by May of 2017 I was having panic attacks which I'd never experienced before then. I was a high school student during this time.

Therapist #3(2017): I worked with a therapist in summer of 2017(age 17) due to the panic attacks. I did well with this program but had relapsed into anxiety by probably mid 2019. I was nearly finished with high school during this time.

Therapist#4(2021): I worked with a therapist for several months in the summer/fall of 2021(age 21) as my psychiatrist ordered therapy as part of my anxiety treatment plan. I failed to make any notable anxiety progress with this therapist and am still struggling with my anxiety up to this day.

Do you see the pattern here? I always seem to see some improvement with my anxiety for a short time after working with a therapist but then always fall back into anxiety within a couple of years.

Does anyone else who's been in therapy experience this pattern? If so what do you do to break out of it?

I am asking because I've been having some personal issues and am considering going back to therapy but I want to be wise with how I use resources. I do also take anxiety meds but I am rather limited on these due to sensitivity to medications. I have read online that you aren't supposed to continuously stay in therapy for years and years.

1pkkcga,"After a chest pain episode, I can’t stop worrying","Hi everyone,

I’m posting here because I feel really stuck and overwhelmed, and I don’t know how to move forward anymore.

A few days ago, I had a very brief sharp chest pain right after a short sprint. It lasted maybe one second and then completely disappeared. At the time, I didn’t think much of it.

Days later, I started overthinking it, and since then my anxiety has taken over. I constantly focus on my heart, analyze every sensation in my chest, and replay that moment in my head. I feel like I’ve lost trust in my own body.

I went to the ER and had ECGs and an echocardiogram. Everything came back normal, and doctors told me it didn’t sound cardiac. Rationally, I understand that — but emotionally, I can’t let it go. My mind keeps asking “what if” over and over again.

This anxiety is affecting my daily life. I struggle to relax, to enjoy normal activities, and to feel like myself again. I feel trapped in this loop and don’t know how to break it.

I’m not really looking for medical advice — more for people who’ve experienced something similar. Has anyone here gone through health anxiety triggered by a single symptom? How did you manage to move forward and rebuild trust in your body?

Thank you for reading.

1pkjz76,"Trouble with ""low intensity"" but constant anxiety","Hello everyone

I am 25M in the USA and am looking for a bit of advice from my fellow reddit users. I have Autism(what used to be known as Asperger's in severity) and Generalized Anxiety disorder for context

I notice that I have days very frequently where I'll just be going about a normal day yet I will feel very nervous/on edge for apparently no reason. I know that it's anxiety because my underarms sweat and I feel shaky and nausea. Sometimes these feeling will subside after a brief time but other times they will last all day. These feelings usually don't get severe enough to cause a panic attack but are oftentimes very uncomfortable and constant.

For context I live a fairly simple life. I work a part time job in an industry I enjoy, I live at home with my parents, I ride the bus to work and I don't have any financial problems.

I am feeling frustrated that even if I follow my treatment plan(twice daily anxiety medication and coping strategies) that I find myself so anxious on a nearly everyday basis and I cannot for the life of me identify the source of my always ""charged up"" nervous system.

Does anyone else experience this and if so how do you help it?

1pkjula,Losing myself to anxiety,"Been dealing with GAD for around 2 years and recently panic attacks. Had a lot going on my senior year and felt that it was the stress of my normal regular life but it began to change I started getting panic attacks something I never really had with GAD and my academic really began to take a turn for the worse just as I was starting to do really well. But I know what I’m going through isn’t normal, I haven’t felt normal in years and haven’t been able to drink a caffeinated drink in ages and it’s silly but it’s hard, You want to drink a Red Bull or a big gulp full of coke and you can’t cause you know you will have a panic attack or just feel the dread of anxiety. I had the chance to go on meds earlier in the year and start seeing a therapist but I started to get used to the panic attacks hangover and the anxiety just started to become my life and I felt like an imposter bcuz what I was feeling shouldn’t be happening because I live a normal life and I should be grateful for everything my family has been through so much but I can’t. I can barely eat and go to school 5 days a week without feeling like hell on earth, I’ve been on Prozac 2 weeks 10mgs and feel the most depressed and anxious I’ve felt all my life.

1pkjjpp,"Shutting down when a friend, partner or family member needs support?","What do you do when you used to be really good at supporting your loved ones, but suddenly your anxiety takes a turn for the worse, takes over your life, and you shut down any time somebody is venting, looking for support, or even just seem *slightly* upset?

I used to be so much better at this, and now the guilt eats me alive every time I fail to support someone I love who needs a shoulder to lean on.

It's like... after a lifetime of dissociation, I'm finally starting to *feel* things again- but that includes debilitating anxiety that I didn't even realize I had?

Just a few months ago (not that long ago!), I considered myself pretty good at supporting my partner (known each other for 8 years, together for 2). They were having a really *really* rough patch in their toxic living situation, and I was always there to help. Not because I felt like I had to, but because I wanted to. I hated the idea of leaving them to face everything alone, so I did what I could to be the best support system I could be, even when sometimes all I could do was listen.  
  
But, suddenly, starting maybe around August, my anxiety has gotten so bad that, any time they reach out with something that's weighing on them, I just... shut down.   
The fight-or-flight takes over-- or, more often than not, I freeze. My chest hurts, it feels like I get tunnel vision, I fall into godawful anxiety spirals-- all while they're in distress, too, and looking for someone to listen, not someone to react worse than them to their own circumstances.

At best, I'm barely keeping myself together, and coming off as a little bit cold/blunt while I suppress the urge to run. At worst, I have to step away to stabilize myself from a panic attack before I can even begin to respond in a way that can help rather than make the situation worse

The anxiety is at a point where I feel like I'm constantly on a threshold, or survival mode -- and any little negative thing is enough to push me over the edge into a spiral. Like a glass of water filled to its absolute capacity, and the slightest movement from somewhere in the room will make it spill over. And it sucks, so, so bad

They know I've been struggling this way, and they've been incredibly kind and patient about it. They themselves don't make me feel guilty or ashamed-- that's all me. My anxiety does manifest in all kinds of other ways, including in our relationship, and they're handling it with so much grace, but I can tell sometimes it can be a lot for them, I get that completely

I'm trying to seek both talk therapy as well as psychiatry, but I can't get in for either until January.   
If it matters to answering the question at hand; I'm diagnosed with depression, autism, ADHD, and OCD

How do I get myself back to a place where I can handle the realities of life again? I'm so sick of feeling too fragile to do anything that matters, even something as simple as being there for a friend, my mom, my partner, etc

1pkjg2f,Miss feeling normal,"The past couple years have been especially tough for me. I will go into these episodes that can last weeks or even months where I feel nothing but physical anxiety symptoms and don't want to do anything, sometimes not even shower or get out of bed. I had this happen to me back in 2016 and had to take short term leave from work for about 3 months and during this time I was put on Prozac and by the time I went back to work I was back to what I like to call ""my normal"". When the prozac pooped out on me they started playing with my meds and adding stuff to it and eventually changing it, I've tried a bunch of different SSRIs and nothing gets me back to my normal like prozac did. I just want to live my life, spend time with my family and be a present father for my daughter, but this terrible illness consumes me and my physical symptoms are all I can think about. Anyone go through anything similar? I decided to stop trying SSRIs for a while so I'm not on any medication as of a few weeks ago, the last one I tried was Zoloft. Coming off of that was rough.

1pkj6va,Dental anxiety taking over my life,"So I have pretty bad dental/dentist anxiety. But not the kind that makes me skip appointments, the kind that makes me want to book in more often than necessary because I need the reassurance that nothing is wrong. I'm 33 and I've never had a cavity. I had an impacted wisdom tooth removed this year and the whole process was extremely stressful and worry-filled. I get so worried I cry sometimes during appointments (which I'm nervous about going to- but I'd be more worried about neglecting to go), and its all I can think about on the days before and after. 

My dentist is good and I generally trust him, but sometimes his language/explanations of things are a little cryptic, which stresses me out more. I had an appointment a few days ago, but now I'm obsessing over questions I forgot to ask, and stressed about having to wait another six months for the next appointment. 

It's not pain that I'm scared of experiencing, I'm scared of there being something wrong with my teeth. It's the body horror aspect at the thought of there being decay/dental issues. And also I'd feel a lot of shame if something was wrong. I'm so scared every time I go in that there will be a surprise problem.

1pkiuuo,"Im not sure, what I can do. I’m scared and stressed out. (Please read)","Hello, I am 20 years old as I just turned on November 18th this year. For all year long, I have been dealing with a stalker by the name of Bubbline (at least that's what he calls himself) who's been accusing me of grooming, and pedophilia. These two are very dangerous accusations that can ruin someone's life, let me start by saying when I was 18-19 l had a friend who was 17 at the time, as we both had inappropriate conversations, but I never had any intention to groom or harm her or anyone in my friend list. I was simply just a dumbass, and who would be too open about their addictions in the past. Recently, in the beginning of February I met a girl, who became my partner as we've been together. (She was 18 and I was 19 when we met)

I met her family, friends, and had the best 5 days of my life spending my time with her, my goal was to change and grow as a better person, and to work on my addictions and finally live a stable life. However, Bubbline who's now my stalker has been sending hate, posted everyday on his TikTok story about me, and even harassed my girlfriend and called her names. He had said many racial slurs, called my partner a fat WhOre, Hell he even lied about her age saying she was younger when we met, when we both shared we were legal adults when we met and wanted to be together, and still are till this day, she even likes to make fun of him. He even tried to turn around and compliment her cosplays.

He has drawn pictures of me getting killed, he even admitted to having murderous intent over me, sent me death threats, made countless videos about me, and even ignored everything I pointed out against him. While he's been screaming, l've been trying to stay silent and keeping my peace, for my mental health.
However it's not that easy, when he's breathing down my neck. I've tried to defend myself but he's super convinced that I'm the evil person, and he's the hero to his story. I can't remember the last time I drew a picture, because I used to love to draw and post online.

Even when I have many proof of his wrong doings, even for some reason being in a discord server, posting fetish thirst art, while minors are attended in the server, apparently that's okay, and me being a dumbass and being too open is a bad thing. I have Asperger syndrome, it's a type of autism that's kinda hard for me to explain. But it's hard to communicate well with people, and I'm too honest in ways.
I cannot take it anymore, I know he's goal is to get rid of me, and to take shots at me as much as he can, because I am a target, and I'm not sure what I can even do in a situation like this.

It's stressful. I am scared to ask for help, because I never have ever been in a situation like this before, what can I do?

1pki49i,fear of being perceived— how do i get over it?,"i hope i word this in a way that is understandable so i can find some support, guidance, or even comfort knowing that someone else may struggle or has struggled with something similar.

i’m 21 years old. i’m a female, quite small, 4’8, 80 pounds. this is important because it has bothered me most of my life. i’ve struggled with eating disorders since i was young, i’ve never felt my age, i’ve never felt comfortable in my own skin. i struggle feeling like a grown woman, i struggle finding beauty in myself, i struggle with confidence, presenting myself, anything that is not cowering behind baggy clothes and keeping my presence small. i can’t stand when people look at me, i can’t stand being perceived.

this is very real and very damaging to my everyday life. i’m unsure whether or not my physical body is the full reason why i am this way, or if it’s things that have led up from my childhood up until now, but i am constantly stuck in a state of dissociation. i obsess about how i look and how i am presenting myself so often that i am never really in present time, i’m somewhere else, somewhere in a future that doesn’t exist— a version of me that never will, the version i could be in that very moment, but instead of being, i visualize it and dream about it instead of just being—because i cannot let go. i cannot be present. it has ruined my life.

i’ve never danced around anyone. i’ve never sung around anyone. the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. i’ve went to parties, i’ve went to the club. i’ve drank, i’ve smoked pot, i’ve taken molly. i’ve played my favorite songs loudly. nothing makes me feel at ease enough to be myself because i am so caught up in both how i look doing whatever it is i \*should\* be doing, and how right or wrong im doing it, but im standing there like a deer in headlights feeing nauseous instead.

i have friends who love to sing and love to dance, and with that, have tried time and time again to make me dance with them—gently, easing me, sometimes just telling me straight up to loosen up and “move my body”.. i can’t. i so badly wish i could, but i can’t. i don’t dance when im alone because i feel like im being watched even if im not. i don’t even really like to sing by myself. if i catch myself doing it i grow embarrassed. i would LOVE to do these things but i just can’t. i get emotional because i genuinely feel stuck, like i can’t move my body, i can’t force myself to open my mouth to speak let alone sing. car rides are awkward, trying to have fun with friends or a potential boyfriend is awkward. i will sing in my head and smile, but even bopping my head feel impossible and embarrassing.. so i stay still while everyone else has a good time. everyone knows me this way and they think im beyond strange— and i don’t blame them. i hate myself for this. i don’t know where to start, i don’t know what to do to make myself feel comfortable. i hate that everything feels embarrassing because i dont know how to “do it right”, even if there is no right way (especially when it comes to dancing).

to add on to sort of the same idea, i don’t drive either. i am afraid of doing the wrong thing when it comes to being taught, to being seen. i avoided sports my entire childhood because i was afraid of failure, afraid of embarrassment, afraid of not being perfect first try, afraid of being wrong. i believe the same thing is happening when it comes to having fun with others, and even by myself. i get this same impending feeling of doom whenever im being taught to drive also. i just want to cry the entire time, many times i freeze up and cant move. to make things easier on myself instead of facing it i say “i dont know how” and leave it at that. i never try, because… why would i put myself in a position to possibly fail and embarrass myself? i so desperately want to be able to at least try.. because when i don’t, i look like im not enjoying myself (or in other situations like driving.. i just look lazy). i don’t know how to just feel good, i don’t know how to not think about what others are seeing or feeling. i don’t know how to not expect perfection. i second guess the things i know how to do, things ive known how to do for years. i’m never sure of myself even when i know something is true. i can’t stand that about myself. 

this isn’t only with dancing, singing, and driving. it’s everything. i am at a complete loss. 

i don’t know where to start so i can gain confidence to conquer this very compact problem of mine.  

i cry over this so much it’s genuinely taken over my life. i want to have fun and do these things, i don’t feel forced, i don’t feel like it isn’t me, i just feel stuck and embarrassed to the point that i would rather die than have fun because im unsure of myself :(",1765511739.0,anxiety

What am I missing? What more can I do? I think it's important to stress that I am not suicidal nor do I have ideation. My family and my partner and my friends all love and support me. My life is so good, but I feel like i have so much to lose that I'm so afraid of losing it. I just need someone here to tell me I'm not alone. I'm not crazy.

1pke01u,I have tried many different forms of treatment for years but nothing works.,"According to my parents, my anxiety started showing around 5th or 6th grade. That's also when I started seeing a psychologist. I had regular sessions for years until I started medication in 9th grade after getting an official diagnosis for anxiety disorder. It worked for a bit, but eventually it stopped. I started CBT again, but it felt like a complete waste of time.

Eventually it got so bad I couldn't work anymore and since I live in Canada and it's impossible to see a doctor, I went to the emergency room. I waited 5 hours, saw a doctor for maybe a miniute and a half and then she sent me to psychiatry where I waited another 4 hours to see a psychiatrist who prescribed me another medication that straight up worsened everything. Couple months later I was able to see another doctor who thought the medication the psychiatrist gave me was stupid and prescribed me another one, but it brought other problems. The doctor said she was going to call me 2 weeks later for a follow-up... that was October 2022 and I still haven't heard from her, and again since I'm in Canada, it's impossible to reach out to her directly. I tried her secretary but to no avail.

After that, I started hypnotherapy. After several sessions I felt a bit better but in the long run it hasn't changed much.

Now I am 23 years old, I am unable to keep a job for more than a week, even though I really want to and try hard. I am unable to make ends meet (obviously), CBT doesn't seem to work, medication was moderately unsuccessful, hypnotherapy is short-lived.

Have regrets.,"It started when I went in for the neuropsych evaluation that my psychiatrist referred me to. One of the first questions was about substance use, and in the spur of the moment I figured screw it, I'll finally say yes to cannabis. My line of thought was that it would send a message that ""this guy is doing so poorly that he went and got a medical card to cope"" framing my anxiety issues for what they were. So far neither of them seem to take issue with it, likely because I did mention I had a medical card. But now I'm worried that I screwed up, as a lot of medical professionals still see cannabis use in a very negative light. The cannabis use is on my neuropsych report, so now I'm afraid of using it in the future as well. It really sucks because I would like to be prescribed something more effective than what I'm on and ideally discontinue cannabis for good, but now I feel like my admitting to cannabis use will be a huge roadblock towards that.

1pkar99,Escalating Anxiety,"Hi, this may be pretty long. I am a 27F married to a 30M, he is my best friend and greatest support system. In August of this last year, we found out we had a miscarriage. I had to have a D&C and the hormones in my body are still going haywire. I have PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) think PMS but on steroids. It causes excruciating anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, among intense physical symptoms before your period comes. Before getting pregnant, I knew exactly when my PMDD episode would start, my cycle was like clockwork. However, now, my hormones are still regulating themselves after the D&C and my PMDD is out of control. I see a specialist for this and we have tried to alter my medications (progesterone & naltrexone) and it has only made my anxiety worse. Before meeting my husband, I had tried two different hormonal contraceptives and three different antidepressants (contraceptives and antidepressants are the usual treatment for PMDD) and I became suicidal on every one of them. My body never follows the rule book and I have had a good handle on it in the past, but I cannot grasp it now. I see my therapist every other week and they don't have any other ideas on how to medically treat my PMDD. 

The anxiety has escalated quickly and is now impacting many of my day to day functions. In the past week, if I am not at work, at least once a day I call my husband before a panic attack starts because I cannot think/make a simple decision. However today, I thought I heard someone in the house while I was downstairs and panicked. I texted my husband to call 911 and have the police come. I knew that all the doors were locked, I knew that our garage code isn't simple, I knew that my dog didn't react to anything happening and still I could not think. I could only feel my heart pounding thinking that I was about to die. I am a very realistic and practical person (or at least I was) and pointing out the facts is what worked for me in the past. I don't think that is working for me now and I am struggling. My husband rushed home today and made sure I was okay. He wasn't mad or upset, just worried for my safety. I feel so embarrassed to have had the police come to my house when no one was actually here. I feel horrible that this is impacting my husband's life too. I feel like such a burden for him and that isn't fair to him. I am very proactive about my health and trying to make sure I am feeling emotionally, physically, and mentally well, but I think the miscarriage broke me in multiple ways and I cannot figure out how to piece myself back together. Does anyone have any tips on anxiety that work for you? I will add - I used to be a big runner, have done 6 half marathons and just enjoy running. However, my husband and I are in the process of moving and since the miscarriage I have not felt any joy in working out. I do enjoy walks and take my dog out at least once a day, but it is also very cold where I live right now so outdoor exercise is not super plausible. I also read books, bake, do puzzles, and enjoy listening to podcasts (these things help distract me and tone down the anxiety), but we move soon, so most things are packed up right now.

1pk968m,"hi, could you help me find out if this is a medical emergency or straight up anxiety?","Hello  
Im a 17 year old female. Fit, healthy (not the healthiest person in the world when it comes to diet, but i do eat my greens, fruits, stay hydrated, and eat full of protein, but i also really love junk food and sweet treats), i have never smoked nor drinked, and trying to stay active by doing pilates 2 or 3 times a week or going to the gym.

Since last late october, after some kind of panic attack, I started really worrying about my heart health, thinking that what i was experiencing at the moment was a heart attack; my chest started hurting, i could really breath, and my whole left side went numb. All the symtomps went away the next day but the chest pain stuck. I then made the dumbest, worst mistake: searching on google. Honestly, the fact that heart attacks in women can last up to months to take place made me frightened. But them, I focused again on school, exams, and trying to pass all of them, that it quickly went away.

Not so long ago, this december, it came back. Sharp, stabbing pains in the upper left side of the chest, migrating to the upper inside part of the bicep, (but not at the same time) it gives me insane anxiety. I'm also taking iron supplements for my deficiency, which I got checked earlier this year after a vasovagal syncope. I had an EKG done and everything was fine. But i don't know if it still is now. I honestly want to make me believe that it is just anxiety because in less that three or four months i have to apply to university. i can't really sleep and im already an anxious person (had to undergo psychological therapy for it) so i get even more tachycardias while realizing i have to work hard for my future + chest pain that makes me wonder if i'll ever have a future, lol.

Im planning on telling my mom tomorrow if it doesn't go away, but i also don't want to ruin the trip we have in a week. It was really expensive and the thought of it really being a serious problem and having to get checked or something like that makes me sad because what if we don't get to go in vacation.

1pk91fj,My PCP minimized my anxiety to my face and I can’t stop replaying it,"I just need to vent because I’m still upset about how dismissive my doctor was today.

I’ve been on disability for severe anxiety and burnout since the beginning of November. My therapist had originally referred me to a disability clinic for the state paperwork, but they don’t handle my employer’s disability insurance. Since my PCP already knew everything I’d been dealing with, I thought going through her for the next part made sense.

She’s the one who treated all the physical symptoms I didn’t even realize were tied to anxiety. When I kept having constant nausea and vomiting, she referred me to gastroenterology. GI found nothing. When I broke out in stress hives and had a mild autoimmune marker, she referred me to rheumatology. They also found nothing. She prescribed prednisone and hydroxyzine for the hives, Xanax when the anxiety turned into chest tightness, and even buspirone earlier in the year because my depression/anxiety screening scores were elevated. She had every piece of evidence that things were getting worse.

I even called her office before scheduling to make sure she handles mental health disability paperwork. They said yes. If they had said no, I would’ve found somewhere else.

But the appointment was awful. I came in with a full timeline because this didn’t happen overnight, and I didn’t even get through the first part before she cut me off and basically told me to “get a new job.” As if switching industries in your mid-30s after a 12 year career is easy. As if I’m mentally stable enough to job hunt. As if the LA job market is booming. As if that magically fixes months of anxiety and physical symptoms.

Then she said she “can’t do more” because other people have “real disabilities.” Hearing that made me feel like she thought I was exaggerating or trying to avoid work, even though she’s the one who has been treating the vomiting, hives, chest pain, insomnia, and elevated anxiety scores for months. My therapist recommended several months off because she believes I hit full burnout. I wasn’t asking for anything unreasonable. I just needed documentation for what’s actually been happening.

She did fill out the paperwork I needed, but it was obvious she was reluctant and only signed off through the beginning of January because that was the maximum she was willing to do, one month. Not what matched my symptoms. Just where she personally decided to stop. It didn’t feel supportive at all.

And the worst part is that instead of having time to rest or work on my mental health, I’ve spent most of this disability leave stressed out about paperwork, approvals, and whether I’d even be believed. The first part of my leave hasn’t felt like healing it’s felt like navigating a system that doesn’t take mental health seriously.

I left feeling embarrassed, invalidated, and honestly hurt. I know I’m not faking anything. But it still stings to be treated like you’re not “disabled enough,” especially by someone who has been treating the physical and mental fallout of this the entire year. I’m exhausted and I hate that asking for help made everything worse. I just needed to get it out.",1765487286.0,anxiety

I at the same time have no sense of urgency to get it checked out, and absolutely every fibre of my being says I should immediately be checked out. 

I am in the situation where I have the sense that something horrible is about to happen in the next coming months, and at the exact same time, I feel I shouldn't be having that sense of impending doom at all. 

As if I'm in a crossroads of me feeling that everything is going to be ok, and that everything is going to be disastrously bad. As in, worst case scenario bad.

1pk8juc,Impossible-to-bypass phone addiction tool needed,"TL;DR:

need a phone addiction tool, w/ following REQUIREMENTS:

\-(at LEAST near-)impossible to bypass/delete 

\-no self-determination suggestions at this time, please 

\-iPhone compatible 

\-no dumb phones

\-app and device suggestions welcome! 

\-but, no phone jails 

Currently using OneSec subscription, considering Brick. Planning to post this in multiple subs. 

Any iPhone-compatible apps or devices that have worked AND are (near-)impossible to override/delete?

I appreciate the “just do this instead,” “just tell yourself this thing,” “delete the apps/accounts,” “put it in grayscale,” “get a dumb phone,” etc. But I am not interested in any of that at this time/have tried it already. No phone jails, I know I won’t stick to it as I’ll just not use it or I’ll increase the time I can use my phone. I’d highly prefer the answer not being to have someone else be keeper of the override password/similar thing, but if it absolutely comes down to it, then sure. 

I need something that I set up with intention, and that will then force me to stay true to it. I currently have a yearly subscription to OneSec. I know I could potentially change more settings through that to make it harder to bypass, but I’m not sure. I’m considering something like Brick and would probably keep it in my detached garage (and winters are freezing cold here, so that’s a bonus. I’m not going out in that just to get on Facebook).

.

.
Ok so I have really bad health anxiety. I also apply it to my loved ones and get anxious on THEIR behalf. It isn’t a mystery; I know where it comes from (have lost multiple loved ones w/varying health issues (witnessed the actual end a couple times) and watched like an insane amount of hospital and medical examining etc. shows growing up because it was “wow! really cool! I want to be a doctor!” then but now has become a “hey remember when you were 11 and this dude died of XYZ on TV?” so I have a weird amount of medical disease Names knowledge and the ability to Google).

The physical symptoms of this anxiety are also of course then feeding further into the anxiety because “well what if this chest tightness and shaking fingers ISNT anxiety…hmmm?” so it’s this self sustaining loop of disaster. And this happens to an extreme at least once or twice a month. I’m probably anxious stressing myself into an early grave at this point, and then I get anxious about THAT, hence the post title. 

I won’t list out my current health problem Fixations because I try to be mindful of others who may latch onto the idea + get stuck in an obsession spiral like I would, but I’m on vacation and one of them is totally ruining the vibe. I’m trying to enjoy the scenic views and all I can think about is where the nearest hospital is, what symptoms to look out for, and what I would do if one of my loved ones (traveling w/ my mom and a sibling) were to collapse and if I still remember how to do CPR and so on so now I’m so stressed I can’t even enjoy my vacation that I’ve spent thousands of dollars and 12+ hours of travel time for. Isn’t vacation supposed to be relaxing? LOL

I’ve tried describing my thoughts to my family in the past and they always give me a glazed stare and tell me to “Stop thinking about it?” which is well meant and I love them but yeah.

This is so unbelievably annoying and I’m so upset for being like this, and it’s only because it’s me that’s it’s a problem. If anyone else was this stressed I’d comfort them, not think they were embarrassing like I do of myself.  

I know I need to try and get help again eventually (tried therapy multiple times and diff medicines to no avail) so this isn’t about that—I just am so annoyed right now and needed to vent LOL

1pk6wyg,"Heart related, nerve compression issues, GERD or anxiety? (Has anyone experienced these symptoms?)","Age: 30 Height: 5”11 Weight: 103kg

This random attack suddenly happened to me while I was working back in April. I had a strange inner chest tightness, and my left arm became tingly and numb. I remained conscious throughout the whole experience. My body was shaking, and during the tightness—which lasted around 10 seconds—I remember my surround sound stopping, and all I could hear was my heart pounding in my ears. I put myself into the recovery position because I had no idea what I was going through. I was in shock, and the first thing I thought was that I was having a heart attack. It was a very strange feeling and still difficult to describe to this day.

An ambulance attended my workplace. They conducted an ECG, checked my blood pressure and sugar levels, and everything was normal. I was taken to the hospital, where blood tests and further ECGs were done, and they all came back clear.

For the first two weeks after the attack, I was severely distressed because I still had no idea what had happened to my body. This distress caused the chest tightness to occur two more times, and I had to call an ambulance again. Further ECGs and blood tests were carried out, and again everything was clear.

Since then, my whole nervous system feels dysregulated. I constantly feel a rush of adrenaline and have weak, jelly-like legs. I have a constant pressure in my head and body. I feel like the chest tightness episode caused trauma. My whole chest wall has felt tight ever since. I sometimes get a burning sensation in my chest, like something is stuck in my throat. I get shortness of breath. I also experience a loss of balance—almost like a sinking feeling behind my sternum. My left forearm and hand constantly have an electrical, tingly, pins-and-needles sensation. I experience heart palpitations. I just feel physically exhausted with these ongoing constant symptoms that won’t go away. Going to sleep with this feeling can be difficult at times.

I do suffer from neck issues stemming from a car accident in 2022. My neck has worsened over time. I constantly feel the need to crack it, and when it flares up, the pain can radiate to my shoulders and back.

1pk4a2u,Any suggestions pls,"Hi,
I wanted to explain my situation properly because it’s been difficult to put into words.

I went through a harassment incident at my college hostel involving a staff member (a peon). He repeatedly targeted me, mocked me, and mentally disturbed me. It went on for my first two years (untill this time I kept ignoring him) before I finally reported it to the hostel warden, college dean, a trusted professor, and my HOD. They took action and I received protection, but the impact mentally stayed with me.

During the time of incident took place 
My exams were going on 
Intrusively his deeds his words (what ill he did to me what ill he told me ) would randomly come 
I know its of no use thinking about him (why u thinking don't think about it)
I felt bad and pain as they came (why did he did it to me , why out of all he kept of harrasing me )
I told myself forced myself (you should focus here on your study Tommorow is your exam)
Same goes for when I was doing leisure activities, for example watching movie(i have to tell my self only watch the movie no need to think ruminate spiral about it)


Since then my mind has not felt safe. I get nonstop intrusive thoughts, a constant fear that something bad might happen again, someone might again target me, harras me, (I also seek for revenge like beating  him up, even though I know it's not a good thing) tightness in my chest, and heaviness or pain in my head (if my mind brings up the flashbacks of those events, even his name ,face do a pulsing pain in my head) (then later i think why I thought about it). My brain keeps telling me negative things like “you can’t do it” or “you won’t enjoy,” automatically even when nothing is wrong around me.

It’s not that I want to think like this — it happens automatically and it’s exhausting. I feel like my nervous system is always in danger mode. Because of this, even normal activities feel difficult and I feel tired, anxious, and mentally worn out most days.
(You can see like i just woke up from sleep and quite few mins later i again feeling tired and worn-out and go back to sleep)

I am taking psychiatric treatment and trying to recover.

This autumn has been incredibly difficult for me. I’m three terms into my university programme (studying to be a psychologist), but I have decided to change programme (to study social work instead). I don’t feel as passionate about psychology as I used to, and I feel lonely in my class. That killed my drive to continue on my programme and I decided to try another. 

I will start the other programme (social work) in January, but I am so extremely anxious. It’s mostly social anxiety. Since I didn’t really get any friends in my current class, I’m scared it’ll happen again. I also feel anxious about changing programme. I constantly worry about if I’m making the right choice, if I’ll end up lonely or feel like it’s too much and quit the new programme as well. 

It’s frustrating because intellectually I know that there’s no use in worrying, that I can’t know the future and have to stay present instead. But it is impossible for me to not feel anxiety. Every day I walk into class I get anxious because I don’t have any friend to sit with, to the point where I actively have to force myself to continue to go to class (I need the school points to keep my apartment, so until I change programme in January, I have to stay in my old programme).

1pk2pkw,How can you work on becoming a less anxious person?,"I’m curious about your opinions. I recently took a language exam, and while I was watching the people around me, I realized how much someone’s general well-being (and basically everything) is influenced by how nervous, overthinking, anxious, or, on the other hand, how calm they are. Unfortunately, I belong to the first group, but I’ve always been really interested in how I could improve myself, especially in this area.

The usual calming thoughts don’t really work for me, even though I know there’s nothing at stake, nothing changes whether I pass or fail, and that the examiners are just people too, they (hopefully) won’t intentionally hurt me, etc. I’ve read so many of these typical “don’t worry” ideas that I don’t think you could tell me anything new, but sadly, none of it has really helped me move forward. I still shake, I can barely speak, and it makes both the exam and the night before extremely difficult. Even while I’m talking, I don’t calm down; I often freeze up and can’t think, and my heart rate goes through the roof, which makes me even more afraid. The only somewhat comforting thought is that my problems don’t start there, but still, when I’m actually in the situation, I can’t detach myself from it.

I really envy those people who take exams completely calm, with minimal anxiety, as if they were just chatting with a friend.

I remember about the unfinished things that I've decided aren't important for now (like reading a different book), about long-term projects (like learning a language) and so on. Scheduling doesn't help, because I start thinking about remaking the schedule.

1pjyxvl,Major Anxiety and OCD from tarot card readings,"Hello, I am here because I am at a loss for words for how else i can help my anxiety

For context! I'm single, and i've been looking for dates using dating apps for a while. I was growing really frustrated with this and then came along an opportunity to have a tarot card reading on halloween. I thought, why not? and so asked about love since i was struggling. It was mostly an okay reading! Until there was a future part of it that mentioned 'The six of pentacles reverse' - and well my tarot reader said 'Someone may try to take advantage of me'

For some reason this sparked a massive anxious streak in me and i decided to delete all my dating apps in fear that i was somehow manifesting a bad relationship. I was also pretty gutted, I really want to find a healthy relationship and this was not the news i wanted!

I suffer a lot with anxiety, and i have some tarot cards at home. I asked them frequently, 'what kind of partner am i attracting?' and it would always point to cards such as 'The knight of swords reverse' , 'the magician reverse', ' The high priestess reverse' and i was gutted, I cried about the cards thinking I was going to end up with some abusive person. This played on my mind for weeks and i decided to lay the cards down. I tried looking inwards and i found that yes, you know what? I DO need to be more intuitive when picking a partner, Ive always ignored my gut feeling when in a relationship and perhaps i have rushed into things too quickly. I felt good knowing this, and spent the last 2 weeks resting, and working on trusting myself again, and when i wanted to start dating, what boundaries i wanted to set.

Flash forward to a few days ago and i felt a lot better! I asked the cards. 'Am i ready to start dating again?' and postive results! I got ( Past: 4 of wands, Present: knight of cups, future: 10 of cups' with the bonus cards of 'reverse 3 of swords and 'the high priestess') I was sooooo happy about this reading! I thought my hard work was paying off.... Until. I asked what kind of partner i was attracting with my energy right now. This is where i got confused. I got: ( Past: 7 of pentacles , present: 9 of cups, future: the moon.) It sounded promising at first, but i had no idea what 'The moon' meant and it really freaked me out! I asked for more clarification to what this meant and i got ( Past: 3 of swords reverse, present: queen of pentacles, future: 8 of cups reverse) and then even more cards, (Past: reverse 7 of cups, present: reverse 8 of wands, future: reverse magician.) ..... I am so confused! For bonus! I asked the cards 'I am afraid of attracting the wrong person, what shall i do?' and it answered: (reverse page of pentacles, queen of cups, reverse 2 of swords.)

Well, I've been spiralling since then, I couldn't get out of my head how the Moon could mean deceit, I had already gotten the reversed magician in previous readings and the revesed high preistess. So, in my spiral, ive drawn more cards, What is the moon trying to tell me? further expansions on what kind of energy am i attracting?""Past: Reverse 3 of swords, present: Queen of pentacles, future: 9 of cups reversed) ( past: 7 of cups, present: 8 of wands reversed, future: magician reversed.) ( past: 3 of swords reversed, present: the star reversed, future: the chariot ) I got more obsessed about deciet and started asking the cards questions like... ' Am i in danger of a partner being dishonest with me?' I got: (Past: King of wands reversed, present: queen of pentacles, future king of swords)( Past: The empress, the present: The devil reversed, the future: Two of pentacles) (Past: 9 of wands, present 7 of pentacles, future: the hanged man.) I also got cards such as (Past: 3 of cups reverse, present: 10 of cups and future: 3 of pentacles) (past: 7 of swords, 2 of pentacles, reverse page of wands)

Even more confusion, so i pulled more, 'How can i best protect my heart while moving forward?' - (Past: 7 of swords, present: 2 of pentacles, future: page of wands). 7 of swords.... panic! and finally...

What is my next partner's intentions? ( The fool reversed, the seven of swords, the tower.)

My worst fears had been shown to me. I cried on the spot, ran to my mother and cried with her. My mental health has spiralled into deep depression and major anxiety, I am having panic attacks and crying all the time. I've told my mother to hide my tarot cards away so i dont pick them up again and have started seeing a therapist. Although they mentioend it could be months before they see me.

 I am living in a state of fear that my next relationship is going to be deceitful and abusive and it breaks my heart because i want to find love, good and honest and i feel like im trapped into meeting this horrible person with no escape, no hope, thats the future partner thats in store for me.

I suppose what i am asking is... How do i get out of this cycle that impending doom is waiitng for me? I'm struggling to eat, struggling to get on with my life because of what has happened. How do i stop thinking that this type of relationship that is what is in store for me? I can't bare to go through that. Anyone who knows tarot and is able to offer their perspective is grately appreicated or if there are any techniques or ways i can ease this overwhelming anxiety would be great!

  
Thanks!

1pjycg8,Can't go outside.,"I was always an outdoor kid growing up but my mum only allowed me in select spaces. I could never go outside of the school and when I do, I have to always have a guardian near me. It started affecting me mentally. There was always the looming threat of SA and the crime rate for my country is one of the highest. I loved going on walks but I also loved the freedom of no one baby sitting me for an hour or two. Then, I think I started adopting my mum's line of thinking and I'm so scared of going outside anymore. There's also some social anxiety mixed in there but that's something I can't quite unpack yet. It feels like I'm wasting away my teenage years because practically everyone I know had had late night walks with friends but I just can't get that because of safety reasons and it makes me feel sad inside.

1pjy9l0,Help me please💔,"I’m a 23-year-old guy, and I’ve been dealing with something for as long as I can remember. I don’t know if it’s anxiety, shyness, or something deeper, but it’s affecting my life a lot.

Whenever I’m in an unexpected or uncomfortable situation, my body reacts in a way that I can’t control. My heart starts racing, my breathing gets fast and heavy, and I suddenly can’t talk properly. My voice changes, my face changes, and I feel extremely awkward — like I’m not myself anymore.
It happens when:
	•	I randomly run into someone (especially a girl or someone I haven’t seen in a long time)
	•	I have to walk into a place alone where people are already sitting together
	•	I go to someone’s house by myself
	•	I’m in an argument or confrontation
	•	Someone criticizes me or puts pressure on me

In these moments, my body goes into panic mode instantly. I freeze, I can’t defend myself, and afterward I feel embarrassed because I know I didn’t act like myself.

On top of that, I have a lot of problems with how I see myself.
I honestly don’t trust myself, and I don’t like how I look. I’m actually embarrassed by my appearance. Whenever I’m in a group of friends or around people, if I don’t like how my face or hair looks that day, I just want to leave. I try to find any excuse to be alone because I don’t want people to see me like that.

The truth is, I don’t even know exactly what I look like anymore — and I don’t want to know. I avoid photos completely. I never let anyone take pictures with me, because I hate the idea of my face being posted on social media and everyone seeing it. People around me know that I’m the “quiet” or “weird” one who doesn’t take photos and doesn’t talk much.

All of this together makes me feel like something is seriously wrong with me. I passed college but I don’t have work because of those problems.

Does anyone else relate to this? What could this be, and how do I deal with

I just wish I had a stable income and could work doing the basics in peace, but these days that simple desire seems unrealistic. 

The paths currently advocated for improving one's life and income are: 

- Sucking up to superiors until (maybe) promoted: well, I have a fundamental problem with that, I don't like selling myself, and I'm certainly not socially capable of doing it effectively if I wanted to. 

- Studying and specializing: it's not a guarantee of recognition because what seems to matter most is the social aspect and brown-nosing, but even if I took that path, I'm quite stupid, my academic record is a disgrace, I won't go far that way. 

- Having an exceptional skill: well, that's more a matter of luck, and I don't have that. I'm incredibly mediocre at everything I do, compared to the people who studied with me and the position I currently hold. 

I was the worst in my class at what I do now; I got  the position through luck and deception, I'd say. In short, considering the limitations and resources I have at my disposal, am I lost in this life? Doomed to misery and squalor?",1765461670.0,anxiety

1pjwnf1,This blew my mind: your gut reacts to stress way before your thoughts do.,"Something I noticed that changed how I see anxiety:



My gut reacts to stress way faster and way louder than my actual thoughts.



It doesn’t understand fear, danger, or “what if'' thoughts.

It only understands:

– tension  

– pressure  

– breathing patterns  

– how fast I’m eating  

– how safe or unsafe my body feels  



And when the gut freaks out, it sends these intense signals upward that FEEL exactly like anxiety.



What confused me for years is that the body can create the anxiety feeling even when the mind is calm.



Sometimes it’s not:

What am I anxious about?



But:

What is my body trying to signal right now?



Things like:

– not sleeping enough  

– eating too fast  

– holding tension in the diaphragm  

– shallow breathing  

– feeling rushed  

– sitting in a weird position  



…can create the SAME physical sensation as anxiety.



It’s wild how the body can set the emotional tone before the brain even forms a thought.



This made me realize:

Sometimes the feeling comes first, and the thoughts try to explain it afterward.

1pjv1zp,Supporting someone with GAD,"Hi everyone,

my brother has GAD (diagnosed a couple years ago but he's been fighting with it for longer) and in addition he might be on the autism spectrum (my family pretty much all have this assumption but don't know if / how to speak to him about it), and he's most likely gifted (he was tested as a kid and the only reason he didn't get the ""label"" was because his social intelligence score was lower, everything else was pretty much through the roof). 

So we have this really smart young man (mid-30s) who is struggling a lot, and with most of that invisible to other people. He does not have a ton of friends (really just one good friend), and he does tend to want to talk more when he's struggling. So I usually interpret not hearing from him as a good sign, but when I do hear from him, it's almost certain that he's not feeling well. His anxiety revolves around health concerns a lot but seems to be fuelled by other things, like when his job is stressful, when he hasn't been around people a lot, when he's gone on a bad date... I mean I guess that makes sense, I feel worse in these situations too.

So I was wondering, in general, what would be helpful? Just listening? Reassurance? Rational picking-apart of the fears he's fighting? Sharing own experiences with anxiety? Practical advice, e.g. with relationship\* / job stuff? 

  
\* this is a point that troubles him a lot in intervals, like, sometimes he's like ""I'm fine alone"" but other times you can tell it's doing a number on his self-esteem that he's never been in a serious relationship, and I think at this point he's kind of given up hope that it will happen

1pjutfj,Any suggestions pls,"Hi,
I wanted to explain my situation properly because it’s been difficult to put into words.

I went through a harassment incident at my college hostel involving a staff member (a peon). He repeatedly targeted me, mocked me, and mentally disturbed me. It went on for my first two years (untill this time I kept ignoring him) before I finally reported it to the hostel warden, college dean, a trusted professor, and my HOD. They took action and I received protection, but the impact mentally stayed with me.

During the time of incident took place 
My exams were going on 
Intrusively his deeds his words (what ill he did to me what ill he told me ) would randomly come 
I know its of no use thinking about him (why u thinking don't think about it)
I felt bad and pain as they came (why did he did it to me , why out of all he kept of harrasing me )
I told myself forced myself (you should focus here on your study Tommorow is your exam)
Same goes for when I was doing leisure activities, for example watching movie(i have to tell my self only watch the movie no need to think ruminate spiral about it)


Since then my mind has not felt safe. I get nonstop intrusive thoughts, a constant fear that something bad might happen again, someone might again target me, harras me, (I also seek for revenge like beating  him up, even though I know it's not a good thing) tightness in my chest, and heaviness or pain in my head (if my mind brings up the flashbacks of those events, even his name ,face do a pulsing pain in my head) (then later i think why I thought about it). My brain keeps telling me negative things like “you can’t do it” or “you won’t enjoy,” automatically even when nothing is wrong around me.

It’s not that I want to think like this — it happens automatically and it’s exhausting. I feel like my nervous system is always in danger mode. Because of this, even normal activities feel difficult and I feel tired, anxious, and mentally worn out most days.
(You can see like i just woke up from sleep and quite few mins later i again feeling tired and worn-out and go back to sleep)

I am taking psychiatric treatment and trying to recover.

After a month it went away again for few days and then it came back till now, I feel like it actually got alot worse in the last few days especially at night when I was just chilling as usual and I felt my body go numb again though I didn't have balance problems or dizzines, on top of that I felt like air was escaping my lungs somewhere for 20 seconds and derealization got alot worse like my brain wasn't processing what I was seeing on top of having a weird deja vu a minute before, I was really tempted again to go to the ER but I didn't (it was 2 days ago) on top of that I now started feeling like that all day long unlike before only at night, when I'm going somewhere I would just often get confused when I go the wrong direction or not remember what I did or said 5 seconds ago alot of times even when my heartbeat is normal, it gets alot worse at night when I'm going to bed and close my eyes for 10 seconds, I would start answering to vivid images that pop up like for example if my brain imagined a person asking a random question I would answer it out loud or move my hand or something, tonight I woke up in the middle of the night confused af, I thought I couldn't speak and move though I could on top of the physical numbness that came back few days ago when I even slightly focus on my limb or whole body it even kinda hurts a bit like phantom pain I would just move my hand and feel like it's actually a cm away from it and the numbness as if you were to keep your hand in cold for a bit and it's numb but whole body, you can move no problem and you don't feel the cold. i can't tell which is worse, the numbness, detachment ( like being only 40% there feeling ) or other symptoms like fear of forgetting how to breathe, feeling like you're about to faint, fearing that you might choke on food, weakened taste buds, or  just anxiety while relaxing, has anybody here experienced similar symptoms combined and fully recovered?",1765450428.0,anxiety
1pjudzk,Can this symptoms cause by anxiety ?,"

Hi everyone,

I'm trying to understand what might be causing the symptoms I’ve been experiencing for more than a year and a half. I’ve done multiple tests (blood work, heart checks, EEG), and everything came back normal. But the symptoms continue to show up on and off.

Here’s what I deal with:

Full-body weakness and fatigue

Body pain that changes location

Numbness and tingling that vary in intensity

A constant pressure inside my head

Episodes of blurry vision

Internal shaking

Burning or warm sensations in different parts of the body

Sudden full-body numbness episodes

Sweating and a sudden drop in energy

Fast heartbeat at times

Morning stomach discomfort and sometimes diarrhea

Feeling drained after small physical effort

A strange “detached” feeling (derealization/depersonalization)

My B12 level is 191 and Vitamin D is 31


The strange part is that these symptoms never appear while running, but they do happen when I'm walking slowly or standing, especially outdoors. Yesterday I was walking and suddenly experienced dry mouth, increased heart rate, weakness, and fatigue, even though I had eaten very lightly earlier in the day.


My question is:
Could symptoms like these be caused by anxiety or panic-related episodes, even if I don’t consciously feel “anxious”?
Or should I be looking more into neurological or nutritional causes like B12 deficiency?

Any experiences or insight would be appreciated. Thank you.

1pjucve,Medication?,"Hi all,

I have been diagnosed with anxiety and emotional dysregulation. I’m 26(F) and have been going to therapy since I was 20 but found my current therapist 2 years ago.

She has been fantastic and I have learnt and improved alot in the last 2 years. Something that I still struggle with is overthinking, paranoia and anxiety especially in social situations. I avoid doing stuff because I feel so nauseas and anxious. It has been so emotionally exhausting. 

I have had a very stressful last few months which has gotten worse recently and since then, my anxiety has been through the roof. I am really trying to get my shit together next year and trying to be the best version of myself but I feel like my anxiety and everything is holding me back. It’s like no matter how much I try and push through it, it doesn’t go away. I try to regulate myself and I manage to do so but it spikes back up not long after.

It is hard for me to regulate myself when I’m at work because I can’t just sit alone at work and do what I har to do. I have had to take some time off study because I just have no motivation. I am so incredibly tired and I either struggle to sleep because my brain won’t shut up or it’s broken. 

My psychologist has recommended me medication July last year. She believes that’s going on a small dosage for a small amount of time while in therapy and creating good habits and building myself would really benefit me. At the time, my ex said no and talked me out of it which is why I hadn’t.

Since I have been feeling so incredibly shit recently and it’s effecting my day to day, I have been thinking about speaking to my GP about doing what my psychologist suggested but after doing research, I’m not certain. It sounds absolutely great to be able to stabilise my emotions so I can put the work in on myself without the extra shit but I have heard so many horror stories about the withdrawals and not feeling the same after and wishing they could go back to how they were and that terrifies me. 

I will speak to my doctor about it but what is your experience with mediation and withdrawals if you have been through them? ",1765449232.0,anxiety
1pjub2g,"Should I move ahead with marriage, with my anxiety disorder ?","Anxiety or nervous system issues were always there but first I got diagnosed with anxiety or panic attack is in 2021 during covid. Took medications not therapy got extremely confident , made significant improvement in life in areas like health, job . 
But in 2022 it triggered again and it took me a while to accept that this is not just one can control with positive thoughts. This time took medications plus therapy understood that body behaves differently and in those times behaviour needs to change, actions need to be taken. Still it’s just not that easy as it sounds. Then also I took a break from searching a partner from arrange marriage. 

Slowly with time nervous system healed , I became balanced. Tried going ahead again. I was searching got close few times, girls were also good but somehow it didn’t worked and then again in june 2025 it started coz i stopped sertraline in between, i admit my mistake (advised for 3 years , i stopped in 1.5yrs) . 
Now even though I am balanced, the kind of negativity or doubts have entered i just can’t able to make a positive picture about marriage in my head. 

As soon as I start to think about it, the last few months struggle comes in front of me. Those panic sensations in head, hands, stomach, chest . And all those times i said mo to marriage in my head. 

Even though I know it’s all BS but still i just can’t make a picture and be calm about it. I am sensitive also , i feel the other person should not have to suffer due to any kind of void in us. 
Any suggestion? ",1765449045.0,anxiety
1pjtt5q,Struggling with anxiety while quitting vaping + trauma therapy,"Hey everyone,

I’m really struggling right now and could use some advice. I recently decided to give up vaping, it was a huge contributor to my anxiety, but the withdrawal has been intense. I’m using Nicorette mints to help, but even with that, the anxiety feels almost impossible to manage sometimes.

On top of that, I’m going through trauma therapy at the moment, which is bringing up a lot of emotions. And, like clockwork, this time of year is always really hard for me. It feels like all of it is hitting at once, and I just can’t seem to catch a break.

I know I can’t go back to vaping because it genuinely made my anxiety worse, but I’m desperate for anything that can help take the edge off. Has anyone been through something similar? Any coping strategies, tricks, or just ways to survive the day-to-day that you’ve found useful?

1pjtnb9,Stuck in retail,"I'm currently stuck in a dead end retail job and as someone with severe social anxiety it is extremely stressful. Every interaction with a customer has me coming away from it thinking that the other person hates me, or is annoyed by me, because of some social mishap I made or the fact that I'm just a generally awkward person. And with Christmas coming up the number of customers is becoming too much for me to handle. The store has been flooded with customers lately, and it's hard to actually focus on doing my job when I'm surrounded by all these people, any of whom could potentially stop me and ask me for something, which can quickly stress me out.

My doctor prescribed me buspirone for the anxiety but it hasn't helped much. Or I haven't noticed any effects, at the very least.

These anxiety issues cause me to be extremely drained at the end of the day, thinking over all the awkward stuff I said or did that probably annoyed someone or pissed someone off, whether customer or coworker. And combined with my depression, it means that my ability to look for a new job is very limited. I do the bare minimum looking for jobs and I find nothing, and I don't improve myself or work on my skills either, because I genuinely can't be bothered. Depression or laziness? Maybe both?

Anyway, not sure why I'm posting this. Maybe just to get it out there, to vent. Maybe if someone has advice that'd be nice but I'm not hopeful. I've gotten little great advice in the past, whether through counselling or online support. I just feel hopeless about my ability to change my situation. I need a new job, certainly, but I can't manage to get one. And in the meantime, I'm just getting by day by day, overly anxious in a job that seems tailor-made to target my childhood fears of having to talk to people, a fear that has persisted into adulthood and has made me dread going into work every single day.

TL;DR: Working in retail as someone with severe social anxiety is draining me, leaving me (combined with my depression) unable to find a new job. I feel hopeless, like I can't do anything at all to change my situation.",1765446456.0,anxiety

1pjr3wd,My anxiety,"Hi guys. I am 22F. For years I have been struggling with general anxiety that seems to have gotten worse over time. I function well. I have a full time job, go to school, and have a boyfriend and close friends. Lately I just feel like I am so overwhelmed and tired. As in lately I mean for the past year or more. I wake up tired and no matter what I do I just feel tired. Like the heavy eyes tired. I am not sluggish per say, just fatigued and stressed. I walk fast and I’m a hard worker and like to get things done.

However, I am always worrying about the next thing. I repeat things in my head over and over. I can’t shut my brain off. Any situation or any to do list I have replays on a loop. It’s hard to put into words but I’m sure anyone with anxiety understands what I mean. This anxiety causes me stress as well. I don’t relax much, I am constantly on the go and even when I do have downtime I feel like I can’t get out of my head. I am always thinking about something, whether bad or good but mostly bad or things I have to get done. I also struggle with fast heart rate. Even at rest its beating fast and beats faster during any situation.

My job is also a high stress environment so that definitely doesn’t help but it pays well and I don’t plan on leaving anytime soon. I feel so anxious at work with the millions of things I need to do. I just feel like I have no time to think and constantly on fight or flight mode. When I get home by the end of the day I don’t even want to talk to anybody, I just want to sleep.

I have spoke about this to my doctor before and she asked if I wanted to take medication. The thing is, I’m pretty against taking medication. The only medication I am on is levothyroxine because I have sub clinical hypothyroidism. I get hot flashes, hair that falls out easily, and feel even more tired. So, I kinda have to take it until I find an alternative. Anyways, I’ve never taken any other medication that I didn’t absolutely have to take. I just feel weird about it. I’m also scared of side effects and if it would change me as a person. I’ve always been a firm believer or letting the body do its thing but I just can’t take it anymore.

We’ve just moved houses and my little sister had to take the bus for the first time. She used to be picked up and dropped off by car her whole life. She’s a germophobe, so she refused to get on the bus on the way home. She missed the bus and stayed at school for an additional hour.

My older sisters and dad didn’t have the time to pick her up, and I absolutely didn’t have the time. I’ve been mentioning how stressed I am for the past 2 weeks and how much I’ve got to get done.

When I talked with my sisters, they were too fed up with the little one to go pick her up. They wanted her to find her way back home by herself as a lesson. However, I knew it was cold and the sun was setting. She wouldn’t have been able to walk home like that. The guilt was eating me alive and making my anxiety worse.

I gave in and eventually picked her up. I was so mad and frustrated and anxious. I was literally shaking with anxiety and anger on the drive.

When I got home, my older sisters were so mad that I had gone to pick the little one up — literally lecturing me on why I shouldn’t have gone and that she needed to learn a lesson. They said she can’t always get her way, but I physically couldn’t stand the thought of her being alone like that.

It went from 0 to 100 so fast I don’t even know how it happened. I was still shaking, but then I was suddenly sobbing. I had absolutely no control over myself. I went to the bathroom in hopes of calming down, but I ended up passing out from how hard I was hyperventilating and crying.

1pjofur,Finally recovering from years of Panic disorder and somatic OCD :),"Hello everyone,

Its been 3 years now that i've been suffering from a Panic Disorder and Somatic OCD, and i guess i really wanted to get this out and finally be able to express myself and what i went thru and hope that my post can help others suffering from this combination feel less alone and hopeful about their future, and share my progress with you all as im very proud of what i have achieved for the past 6 months but i have no one to share it with.

I'm 23 and most of my life i have always been fairly normal, except for my social anxiety as a teenager which i guess started all of this unconsciously. Ive never thought once in my life that it would get this bad and id be dealing with this hell of a disorder.

3 years ago is when everything started, one day i started noticing my breathing and i couldn't stop noticing it which lead me to start breathing manually... at first it was fine as i thought it would go away on its own but it never did and i found myself breathing manually for 70% of the day, i couldn't sleep and i couldn't talk to people at all which made me thought i would be like this for the rest of my life, i would never be able to breathe automatically again...

This experience lead me to develop the panic disorder, everytime i was breathing manually, so many about 15k times a day i would panic cause i thought this would never end and i broke myself, and in the span of 6 months it became so deeply ingrained that it essentially became a pattern.

After 6 month the manual breathing went away, as in 2022 chatgpt came along and i was finally able to get a tool where it could give me direct advice and understand it and it gave me solid advice to just not fight it and let it happen and it worked.

but the panic stayed as my brain made it a new baseline to panic every-time i breathed like conditioning, and i was experiencing a panic attack about every 10 minutes or so and everytime i breathed every day for the next 2 years, it was horrible, i think a lot of people here knows how it feels like so i don't really have to describe it.. but it was hell, nothing worked to stop it.

6 months ago i finally started seeking therapy for it and my therapist recommended me ACT and Exposure therapy, where you accept the feelings and let it happen and expose your brain to it until it becomes desensitized to it on its own, and it has finally been able to break me out of this hell, i fought so hard, every day to expose myself to the panic, to different triggers and now although i still have it, i am able to function normally despite the panic attacks being here from times to times and im able to make it background noise and know that nothing will happen to me.. its so freeing to finally get myself back, my freedom and being able to do things knowing it cant hurt me..

i saw a huge reduction in the frequency of when it happens, from like every 10 minutes to every 4-5 hours or so and when it happens now it subsides quickly like after 30 seconds or a minute, i only get peaks now and it goes away.

Im very proud of myself from what ive accomplished and i keep looking forward to my future, and finding my peace, and i hope that anyone else suffering from this does too, just know there is a light at the end of it and i hope you all find your light, its hard but we are incredibly strong, its a horrible disorder and yet we are still here and still fighting, we are genuinely very strong and this strength will be a sort of gift once healed :)

I wish you all the best, in your journey to find this peace.",1765427249.0,anxiety
1pjo4td,Palpitations/PVCs ruining me,"I don’t even know where to start. I feel like PVCs have been controlling my life for months now, and I’m honestly exhausted. I’ve always been a little prone to health anxiety, but it was never debilitating until this whole PVC mess started. It’s like the second I felt that first weird thump in my chest, everything in my life got divided into “before” and “after.”

For most of my life I never really thought about my heartbeat. I knew anxiety could make me feel off sometimes, but I never paid attention to the physical stuff too much. Then one night, completely out of nowhere, I felt this HUGE thud in my chest, like my heart literally flipped over. It scared the hell out of me. I sat up immediately, convinced something terrible was happening, but then nothing else happened… until it did. More random thumps. Then quiet. Then another one. I barely slept that night because I was just lying there waiting for the next one.

After that, it was like my brain locked onto my heartbeat 24/7. I couldn’t stop scanning myself. Every little flutter or pause sent me spiraling. I tried to talk myself down at first, telling myself it was just anxiety, but I’d never felt anything like that before, so of course my mind automatically jumped to the worst-case scenario.

I finally went to the doctor, totally prepared to hear something terrifying. They did an EKG (which of course came back normal because my heart always behaves perfectly when someone else is looking at it). Eventually they sent me for a Holter monitor. I wore the stupid thing for 24/48 hours — felt like I was hyper-aware of every beat while it was attached — and when the results came back, they said it showed some PVCs and PACs, but still under the “concerning” range. Apparently “benign.” Love that word. Benign. It should’ve made me feel better, but it honestly didn’t. All I could think was: If they’re so benign, why do they feel so awful? Why do they feel like my heart is tripping over itself?

I cut out caffeine completely, which was its own nightmare. I cut out alcohol. I drank more water than any human should. I tried breathing exercises, stretching, sleeping earlier, everything. Sometimes the PVCs went away for days, which gave me false hope, and then BOOM — one random night I’d get a cluster of them and be right back at square one. It’s like my body waits until I finally relax and then throws one in just to keep me unstable.

The worst part is that when I’m doing something fun or distracting, I barely feel them at all — which tells me anxiety is definitely feeding the fire — but the second I’m quiet or trying to sleep or even just sitting still, my whole brain zooms in on my chest. Is that a flutter? Was that a skipped beat? Am I about to go into some deadly arrhythmia? It’s honestly pathetic how much time I spend just thinking about my heart. I used to worry about normal life stuff; now I worry about whether one rogue heartbeat is going to kill me.

I know, logically, PVCs are common. I know tons of people have them and don’t even notice. I know my tests were fine and my doctor wasn’t concerned. But it feels like I can’t escape this loop. I’m tired of constantly checking my pulse. I’m tired of bracing myself for the next thump. I’m tired of being scared to lie down at night because that’s when they hit the hardest. I feel like my entire personality has been replaced with someone who just… obsesses over their heart rhythm all day.

I guess I’m just venting because I don’t know what else to do. I don’t want PVCs to take over my life, but right now it feels like they already have. If anyone else has dealt with this or gotten through it, I would genuinely love to hear how, because I’m starting to forget what “normal” even feels like.

1pjo4e5,I think ive developed health anxiety. Is this normal?,"Im 20M and awaiting a doctor's appt. A few weeks ago I was having issues breathing, and now getting checked to see if I have asthma. For the last couple weeks ive been good. Last week I was on a date with my bf, we spent the day at a mall, shopping, went to other places. Then the place we ate dinner at was crowded and full of people. While eating i noticed the way my food went down my throat, it felt like I could feel everything. Every texture. Hear every sound. Then my heart rate went up and my breathing swallowed.​​ Im neurodivergent and can get overwhelmed easily, but this feeling was different. My bf held my hand and calmed me down abit, we left after but I freaked out. 

Its been a week now. I haven't had issues breathing. But I keep having that sense of doom over my head. That uneasiness that something is wrong. I keep worrying about it, then my mind goes to thinking maybe its a brain issue and the reason im so anxious is because something neurological is happening. I also noticed I cant hardly eat. Everytime I do that feeling comes back. I can only eat a little at a time, it doenst matter if its my favorite meal in the whole world. I keep thinking im on the verge of a heart attack, or stroke. My shoulders or chest will also hurt as a response. I have no idea where this came from, but theres a couple possibilities I've rationalized. 

1. Im anxious about potential asthma. Usually im a calm person and the type to ""see what the doctor says"" but its possible theres underlying anxiety. 

2. My uncle recently passed suddenly in a motorcycle accident, reminding us that life can be cut very quickly and suddenly. I wasnt even that close to him, he lived in another state entirely​​​. But this was right after my breathing issues (assumably from allergies)

3. Its something much worse than anyone imagined and I just dont know what it is yet. But my bf thinks im fine and lowley overreacting abit. 

Is it normal to randomly developed health anxiety? This was never an issue for me before, im 20 and generally healthy as far as im aware. ​

I’m trying to figure out what the typical dosage is for anxiety. Is 50mg considered high? Do some people need a higher dosage than that for anxiety? If 50mg is considered at the high end for dosing, then I’ll probably throw in the towel. My psychiatrist is flexible with dosing but she also doesn’t seem well versed with dosing. Any insight?

1pjm4z0,Anxiety hangover in full effect,"On Saturday night I started to not feel super great and went to bed wearing my Fitbit and before falling asleep saw my pulse was at 110 lying down. Proceeded to sleep about an hour before waking up panicked and seeing my pulse over 110 again. That kicked off 5 hours of me being unable to sleep for the rest of the night and just laying in bed panicking and not feeling well.
Attempted to get up and go to work and felt ok after a shower and for the first half hour but when I tried to eat my breakfast just felt sick. Was constantly either too hot and sweating or too cold and freezing. Eventually decided after 2 hours at work to go home and rest. After getting home I check my blood pressure to see it at 145/100 and checked my blood sugar (I am diabetic) to find it at 250. That lead me to driving myself to the ER.
After some blood tests, being hooked to a ECG and blood pressure monitor that showed me at 160/115 and a full bag of saline drip, got told it was likely just a stomach bug and to go rest it off. But realized after they released me they never did blood tests to rule out clots and started to panic I was having a heart attack. Ended up going to my moms and having a good cry and felt much better and was able to sleep that night, although tossing and turning pretty regularly. 
Decided to call in the next day to rest and relax and got an hour walk in and was feeling a lot better. A more restful sleep later and I went to work the next day and made it through about 75% of the day before feelings of anxiety came back. Got off work, went for another walk, and then took a shower before bed where I took 40mg of CBD gummies and a 3mg melatonin gummy. Felt alright and went to bed only to wake up freaking out again. This time no nausea but just a heart burn like pain in my chest and joint soreness in my shoulders and elbows. 
Ended up staying awake for 4 hours before I was able to get a little more sleep in and go to work where after 75% of the day we went to a company bowling event. Before I showed up to work was able to meditate and stop the nerves in my body from being on end but still felt plenty of anxiety throughout the day and random chest tightness/heartburn feelings as well as pain in between my shoulder blades. 
Now I’m at home sitting on a heating pack on my back and trying to calm down. Thankfully I don’t work tomorrow but just feel so tired/done with this feeling that something is wrong even though I know that if I were having any kind of cardiac emergency it would’ve been more pronounced and more of an issue either on my walks or while bowling with my co workers. 
I guess I just wanted to vent but if anyone has tips for things I can do to not be so on edge or even just to help someone know they’re not alone in their feelings right now. We will get through this and feel better, I know it ",1765420416.0,anxiety

1pjlw5m,Nuropod actually seems to have helped.,"So.. about 4 months ago I decided to talk with Dr. GPT about anxiety and see if it had any suggestions I hadn't already thought of.

It actually mentioned one that I had messed with in different ways, but never this directly ""Vagus nerve stimulation.""  

I had tried various forms of VNS in terms of breathing exercises, meditation.. even stimulating the dive response by putting a cold mask on (which is supposed to stimulate the Vegas nerve). However, none of them every really seemed to make a big dent.

I found several Vegas Nerve stimulators online... However, the Nurood (it's pricey) came with the most research behind it.

What you do is attach a little clip to your left ear and it delivers tiny electric shocks (it feels like a slight pulsing). I do it for 20 minutes in the morning while doing breathing exercises and then 30 minutes at night while watching TV in bed. (From what I have read, you don't want to overdo it as it can cause overstimulation that way).

However, I can say that it certainly seems to have helped. 

My anxiety spikes don't seem to be as debilitating as they were. I recently did something that used to cause me HUGE anxiety (walk, instead of drive to the supermarket so I didn't have a quick escape) and while I felt some anxiety, it wasn't the usual 9/10 I would get, which is what led me to just drive instead even though it is only a mile away).

This is NOT a cure by any means and it is expensive ($900).

But, it does seem to have helped, so I wanted to share.

Just google Nuropod and you will find it.",1765419747.0,anxiety

1pjigr8,Just admitted to myself that I have food anxiety. What now?,"I (26f) have been struggling with, I guess you could call it, disordered eating or food anxiety. I never had an eating disorder per se, but for as long as I can remember, I've had anxiety about food. When I was born, I was premature by 2 months and have always had issues with eating. My mom even said that whenever she was breastfeeding or bottlefeeding, she would have to feed me in increments because I would always throw up. I never really had a big appetite and, as I got a little older, there was a period of time where my father wouldn't let me leave the dinner table until I ate all of my food which would cause me to get sick again. Ever since then, I would have frequent occurrences where I could be starving, but as soon as there's food in front of me, I would get nauseous and can't eat. There would be instances where I would be at a restaurant with my family and as soon as the food comes out, I get nauseous, try to take small bites, then start gagging and have to go outside. It could be triggered by even the sight and smell of food.

It has definitely gotten better now that I'm an adult, but I still experience this food anxiety in certain situations. For example, this past Thanksgiving, I started getting anxious when it was dinner time. It was a sit-down dinner, not like previous years where everyone kind of grazed throughout the night. No TV, no music, just everyone at the table eating. I'm prescribed an anxiety med that I take for emergencies, which definitely helped with the anxiety symptoms (sweating, deep breathing, etc) but I still had no appetite and would get nauseous whenever I tried to put food in my mouth. It isn't until later when I'm calm that my appetite comes back and I can eat everything in sight.

My mom thinks that it's a subconscious trauma response to my dad force feeding me. Since I've never explored it until now, I don't know what form of therapy or what kind of specialized doctor would be able to help me with this. It's very embarrassing and something I'm upset I can't control. Any advice is very much appreciated.",1765410351.0,anxiety

1pjhyab,20 M Need Some Advice for Anxiety,"In the first week of October, I developed a gut infection after several painful episodes of diarrhea, which was followed by a bladder infection and a UTI over the following weeks. This sequence of illnesses triggered muscle spasms, nerve tingling/burning/numbness, abdominal and groin pain, debilitating fatigue, and significant stress. I had never experienced that level of pain all at the same time ever in my life.



I was prescribed Levofloxacin for the UTI, along with a few other medications and vitamin supplement to manage the GI symptoms. During this period, I became extremely stressed and hyper-focused on my symptoms—constantly looking up diseases and catastrophizing, worrying that this might become a lifelong condition.

By early November, the accumulation of symptoms and fear caused my stress levels to escalate even further, and I was only sleeping about two hours each night. Although the primary infection symptoms have now subsided, I’m still dealing with lingering issues: nerve tingling, headaches (often accompanied by a heavy feeling in my head), fatigue, shortness of breath, rapid shallow breathing, frequent yawning, and muscle aches in my neck, shoulders, and back. Since early November, I’ve also had a persistent dry, burning sensation in my eyes, for which I’m using eye drops.



It feels like my body is stuck in a constant fight-or-flight (or freeze) mode. My doctor believes this is generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and suggested both CBT and an SSRI. Been to 1 session of CBT don’t think it was too useful because I couldn’t attribute what my anxiety trigger was(will continue CBT though). All of this is very new to me—I’ve been through stressful situations before, but I’ve never experienced anything like this. Even caffeine makes my physical symptoms significantly worse, so I’ve had to stop it, which has been a huge bummer.



Most days now, I feel mentally calm but physically pained and exhausted. Its not like a thought is triggering physical symptoms of anxiety, its more like these symptoms are always there throughout the day. Right now, I’ve started doing yoga, meditation, and trying to improve my diet. 

Just wanted some advice from anyone who has dealt with something similar, especially regarding medication as thats something I would preferably want to avoid.(Sorry if this is too long.)

1pjhtb2,i found out its easy(er) to talk to and meet new people at a boulderroom/boulderhall,"there are indoor boulderhalls and climbinghalls. i do both, but its much easier starting a conversation in the boulderhall i have noticed. 

**in the boulderhall:** there you just try your route and then rest. while resting you just look around (dont stare, well its obvious ;P) and sometimes at people if you feel like it. 

sometimes (its not so rare) a good opportunity arises when you can say a little sentence, like when someone tries the same route and is better:""oh, i will need a long time to can do it"" or is worse:""ah, this (route) is particulary hard (do as if you are struggling, make your weak, so he/she isnt sad or intimidated)""

  
or if you search a girl or a boy, a mate LMAO: just climb and fail, stay sitting then look around, look at people and into their eyes (thats important) and see if you notice someone who notices your views and looks back. either he/she comes to you or you need to come to her/him. if you are unsure, just go away some distance and if he/she comes back after minutes, he/she is maybe, probably interested, well not uninterested anyway.

also if you have a friend or sister/brother, take them with you. other people are more open and relaxed when they meet the same sexed people.

  
i didnt find anyone in the **climbing hall**, because i find its harder to start a conversation there. you hold your partner with the rope there and its always a 2 people group and more serious/more concentration.

maybe this helps some :)",1765408637.0,anxiety

I really do not want to do some things that should actually be really enjoyable, such as going on trips, doing even ""little"" activities like just a day in the mountains, skiing, things like that... I don't know why, I feel the NEED to to them, because if I refuse to, I feel extremely guilt, ungrateful, I feel like I'm wasting opportunities and really missing on beautiful things, but actually I just DREAM about the after, when everything will be over, when I will be able to go back to my routine, when I won't have anything planned anymore. Until then, I cannot relax, I will always have in my mind that thing (trip, etc...) that I will HAVE to do, and I can't relax, like that thought it's ALWAYS in a corner in my mind. It's so weird, because those things are things that I actually enjoy, like skiing, I love being on the mountains, see the view, the feeling of skiing, so it doesn't make any sense, but I feel kinda anxious about having something planned. And then I'm so happy and I talk about it, once it's done, and I feel so at peace, with my conscience I guess??, at peace because I did the ""right"" thing, I made the right choice. But that ""good"" feeling gets only AFTER that experience is over. I hate it, it actually ruins everything, I actually always wish that nobody proposes me anything, so I don't even have to make a choice.

1pjh2bq,Advice on anxiety freeze response,"I have this chronic freeze thing where my brain shuts down very easily physically and mentally, whenever I try to do anything like thinking, speaking, tasks, hobbies, etc. I don’t feel the panic, my body jumps straight into freezing but I’m also hyper vigilant at the exact same time, I notice everything and everyone around me, I notice how their energy and moods drop and it signals danger which makes it worse and then if I try to force myself out of being frozen I start spiralling, crying and hyperventilating etc or sometimes this just comes after being frozen too, which then leads into autistic shutdown. It feels different to my normal anxiety because I don’t feel any warnings at all, it’s like someone slamming on the brakes and I jump headfirst into freeze with no warning before I feel a drop of the worrying, feeling anxious and scared I feel like I’m constantly like 60/70% frozen and only like 30% of me is actually doing what I’m supposed to do but I also experience chronic brain fog (I’m not sure if that’s also related  my freezing or if that’s its own thing) it’s very weird I’m not sure if I’m even describing it correctly so I’m sorry, I’m autistic so putting things into words and sentences is also difficult for me.

I have tried Cognitive behavioural therapy but it doesn’t help at all because there’s no thoughts to challenge when the freeze hits, I’ve tried grounding but honestly grounding exercises only make me angry- grounding helps if I’m having a panic attack where I’m hyperventilating or having spiralling thoughts but it really does not touch the freeze, it feels like anything I do to unfreeze my brain just triggers me again and I’m extremely exhausted from it

Any advice would be greatly appreciated and knowing if there’s others that experience this would also help me not catastrophise my experience because so far I’ve only learnt I’m not worthy of help because the help does not help at all, everything I’ve tried so far as had no positive outcomes ",1765406775.0,anxiety

Already went to multiple doctors and ruled so many things out that at this point it’s either a super rare ailment that occurred for no reason or it’s just a physiological manifestation of something like anxiety.

I’ve always been anxious but never to where I got panic or anxiety attacks or that I’d think it would manifest physically.

The doctor recently noted that I have some hyperthyroidism and Grave’s which often manifests as physical symptoms of anxiety. My resting heart rate was 110-120+ almost always. Overheating easily. That all could’ve compounded with my health anxiety which again I feel a lot of anxiety mentally but I didnt think it’d manifest physically. How I’ve heard it explained is that it’s like your body is permanently on fight or flight even if your mind isn’t.

Wondering if yal ever get these long bouts of headaches as you feel your anxiety manifest physically. I usually only feel the high heartrate when I’m super anxious but now my heart is like 120 even if I’m sitting and near 100 if I’m lying down.

1pjex5b,I’m worried about my teen developing psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia,"A little background. I have a raging anxiety disorder. It’s been on and off total for about 10 years. I’ve been doing well, up until the last year when I found my husband was having an affair. The disorder came back full swing, reintroducing my fear of schizophrenia. I’ve worked through this particular fear before, as I used to worry that my anxiety symptoms would lead me into full blown schizo land. After a lot of work, I seemed to be doing ALOT better with it… when it came to myself.

I have two children. One 14, the other 6. Both have been treated for anxiety. My 14 year old however is having a hard time with life right now. He resents his father for cheating on me, and to be honest, the last year has been hell for all of us. He also has a hard time in school. He has great grades, keeps them up. But he gets so stressed about it. He also has a history of being bullied/picked on. On top of all that, he broke up with his girlfriend a couple of months ago and she has been stalking/harassing/and asking others to bully him online.

This all brings me to my concern. A few months ago, my 14 year old told me he was having hallucinations. He knew the things he was seeing weren’t actually real, so he was able to distinguish the difference. He explained that he would see something, blink, and it would go away. He had 3-4 hallucinations over the course of 4 days. He was sick (possibly with mono) the week prior. I do mental health checks with my children weekly, just to see how they are doing. He said he has not had any hallucinations since. 

Last night, when doing our weekly check in, he asked if he could skip school. I asked him why and he said because no one at school likes him. He’s getting picked on again, and says people talk about him. He told me he feels weird when he’s in school, and the best way to describe it was lonely. I tried to dig deeper, but he had a really hard time explaining exactly what he was feeling. 

So, my question is, do we think this is all just anxiety/ normal teen development topped with lots of stress factors? Or is my child in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia? I’ve got myself so worked up about it, it has literally been making me sick. ",1765401619.0,anxiety

1pje5o8,"10–14 day anxiety waves, false windows, and now starting mirtazapine + quetiapine. Anyone else relate? (Day 10 of latest episode)","Hey everyone, I’m in the middle of another 10–14 day anxiety “episode” and I feel completely overwhelmed. I’ve tracked these cycles for months, but this one has hit really hard, and I’m hoping someone else out there understands this pattern.

My anxiety doesn’t come as single panic attacks — it comes in waves over many days. Full-body surges, buzzing nerves, morning cortisol dread, doom thinking, then random short windows of calm before the next crash.

My typical pattern:

•	⁠Emotional trigger → a few days later the morning anxiety starts
•	⁠Waves throughout the day, sometimes hours long
•	⁠Brief “windows” that have me into thinking I’m ok. Late evenings I am mostly ok, perhaps slight lingering anxiety
•	⁠Then an even worse day after that
•	⁠The peak always lands around Day 7–10
•	⁠Things only really settle after a couple of solid nights of sleep ￼ This episode started around 1st December after a difficult emotional trigger involving family stuff. Slowly built into full hyperarousal: barely sleeping, buzzing legs, adrenaline dumps, internal shaking, doom, the lot.

Medication timeline (this part feels important):

I was originally prescribed mirtazapine 7.5mg about a month ago. I took it once back then but didn’t like how it felt.

•	⁠Day 7: Took 7.5mg again → actually slept really well that night.
•	⁠Day 8: Took the same 7.5mg → but this time the anxiety completely overpowered it → horrible sleep, constant waves, felt like I was falling apart.
•	⁠Day 9: Ended up in A&E because the waves were relentless and I couldn’t cope. They reviewed everything and prescribed: • Mirtazapine 15mg at night • Quetiapine 25mg twice daily

So Day 9 (last night) was when I actually started the 15mg mirt + quetiapine combo.

Last night on the 15mg and 12.5mg Quetiapine, I finally slept properly again — deep, long, restorative sleep.

But today (Day 10) I’m still getting strong waves, emotionally I still feel shaken and unstable.

Where I’m at right now: • Day 10 of this episode • Physical intensity strong today even after solid sleep • Emotional intensity still high • Terrified tomorrow might be another bad day • Really hoping two nights of good sleep will break this cycle

These episodes feel like my nervous system is stuck “switched on” for 10+ days straight. It’s horrible.

Does anyone else get these long multi-day waves where one day looks promising and the next day hits harder?

And if you’ve taken mirtazapine or low-dose quetiapine for this kind of prolonged episode, how long did it take before things genuinely eased?

1pjdxa4,Opinions on prescriptions that actually work.,"Hi, I have extremely bad anxiety, so bad that it’s caused me to stop driving as much and doing other things I always enjoyed because I’m so scared of something bad happening. I haven’t been able to get a diagnosis yet but I believe I have OCD. I’m constantly worried something bad is going to happen and other things.

Anyways, I’ve tried a lot of meds and none seem to quite do the trick. My current prescriptions are 450mg of Wellbutrin and 5mg of Abilify. Also prescribed Spirnalactone but I think that’s unrelated. I hate the side effects of them though. Abilify gives me a tremor and the meds to fix it give me blurry vision. Wellbutrin (I think) causes my mouth to taste like metal. I’ve tried Prozac, Zoloft, lamotrogine, and a couple others I forget. 

If anyone has any recommendations on how I should best proceed I would really appreciate it. I feel so frustrated because all the meds I try seem to work at first and then don’t work anymore. ",1765399314.0,anxiety

Just that quiet pressure, the kind that makes you stare at the wall because your system is bracing for something, even though nothing is happening.

People think it’s “overreacting,” but it’s the opposite.

1pjdtqv,Propranolol might be a life saver,"I just wanted to share my experience because I was hesitant to start any drug. 

I started therapy and met with a psychiatrist this week for my driving and flying anxiety. The anxiety is so bad, like almost immediately and automatically a panic attack when getting on the freeway. 

The psychiatrist gave me 10 mg propranolol and today was my first time trying it. After an hour, I could not feel any inkling of anxiety so I decided to see what would happen if I hopped on the freeway. My brain still had some fear, but not feeling any of the physical symptoms almost immediately changed the way I view driving. I wondered why I ever felt scared.

Most of my anxiety stems from the physical sensations and I think my brain learned to fear things based on what my body tells it, so I think the propranolol will help to train my brain to not be scared of these things. On top of therapy (EMDR), I think this might be the golden ticket. ",1765399080.0,anxiety

1pjcxbm,Does anyone else get overwhelming thoughts + surreal feelings during normal activities? Panic episode at the salon today.,"Hey everyone. 29F here. I’m hoping someone out there has experienced something similar because today really scared me.

I had a 2.5-hour hair appointment, something I used to love and find relaxing. But the entire time, I felt like I was in this weird, altered state. I looked totally normal on the outside and was able to talk to my stylist, but inside it felt like a war.

Here’s what happened: My mind was flooded with nonstop, random thoughts and old memories, almost like a mental slideshow I couldn’t pause. I kept feeling like I might throw up, pass out, or even lose control of my body. At one point it felt like I wasn’t getting enough air, even though I was breathing normally. I felt sort of detached/unreal, like the world wasn’t “settling” in my brain correctly. I considered leaving early or saying something, but I pushed through and didn’t. From the outside, I probably looked totally fine, but I felt terrified inside.

For context, I’ve been dealing with intense anxiety and panic since a major panic attack a couple months ago. I also only got about 4 hours of sleep last night, which probably made everything worse.

Now I’m home and I still feel weird, shaky, and scared I’m “losing my mind” or becoming psychotic, even though deep down, I think it’s just another panic episode + exhaustion. I absolutely bawled my eyes out when I got home. 

I’m on anxiety medication and have a rescue med but I try to fight taking it cause it’s Ativan.

1pjap8j,Anxiety since adopting cats,"Dear reddit users,

my bf and i (both in our early-mid 20s) have always been surrounded by cats since we where children. Around 7 weeks ago we adopted 2 cats (mother and her baby) from an animal shelter, after living together for a year and thinking about getting cats for months. The two are amazing, very bonded to each other and pretty much everything around them and us living together works perfectly fine.

But since we got them my anxiety has been regularly going through the roof. I’ve been feeling really restricted—almost trapped. I feel so tied to them that it’s like my freedom disappeared. I worry about going on holiday, traveling, or even just waking up one day and wanting to go backpacking. It feels as if I’ve taken so many future options away from myself, and that’s been weighing on me.

Before I got them, i made sure that i have a few options of people that would „adopt“ them, in case we can’t keep them because of various reasons (f.e.: work, education, moving somewhere we can’t take them) and we also have a friend who we trust and promised us we can always drop them off at her place in case we go on vacation (since she doesn’t have a drivers license, and can’t come to our place). 

These two cats really brighten my day, and make the apartment a much warmer place and still i am here having regular panic attacks feeling like i took my freedom away from me, horrified at the thought that i am tied to them for the next 20 years and already feeling miserable thinking i have to give them away one day and them feeling terrible.

I feel like i made a huge mistake and a egoistic, stupid decision. I'm already thinking about giving them away to a relative who wants to get cats in Spring, before they get more bonded to my bf and me. I FEEL LIKE I'M CRAZY. As i said in my day to day life i enjoy living with them so much, watching them bloom and lighting up after adopting them from the shelter. BUT i can’t stop thinking about the most random future szenarios, which i have no idea i even ever will want to do. Please tell me if anyone has had a similar experience or ideas on how to handle this situation and CHILL TF OUT. Or if it’s better to actually give them away.😭

Thank you to everyone anticipating!

1pja5q5,Is it harmful for me to love plushie so much?,"Hello, I'm here for longer venting and a question. Most of this will probably sound extra weird and crazy so please... but I thought it was relevant to the question, it's just a few words about trauma and then question...

I've currently had baby fever for 5 months straight. 
I think maybe it's got better... Or maybe not...? I'm not sure, I just got really attached to this little cute plushie puppy. I took him as my own baby, we keep cuddling and he's just so sweet. I can't explain my feelings when I'm holding him. He's like my own literal baby (nameless though). I don't even know where he's from and how old is he, but I've had him most of my life.

I thought he helped me with my 5-month lasting baby fever a little, but now I'm thinking the opposite kinda...?

He's making me so calm and I'm so excited to see him after a day even though he's always with me, I'm always so overjoyed with him I want to cry. Last time I have severe anxiety and stress and with him I feel so peaceful and quiet inside and so warm. He's just so sweet and adorable, I wish you could see him alive. He also has my scent. I didn't put anything on him but I cuddle with him so much he smells sweet on his muzzle because I'm nuzzling him and rubbing cheeks so much.

But I feel also so, so overprotective. Like, he's mine, with me is safe, but also he doesn’t hurt me. I feel panicked and have intense distress without him.

When I'm cuddling him, everything feels so gentle and soothing, but in a second dark thoughts start and I can't turn them off and suddenly I feel sadness and fear of losing him.

I'm extremely worried I'll lose him somewhere (it already happened to me once with a white tiger plushie when I was little). I have ADHD so... Also I'm bringing him everywhere with me, he's always in the inner pocket of my jacket or in my bag (but I feel bad for him because it's probably uncomfortable even though he's a plushie). I would totally break if I lost him. I’ll fall apart, he's making me feel so safe but not in the same time because of the fear of loss, I would collapse if I lost him.

I carry him everywhere out of fear and feel panicky at the idea of separation. I feel responsible for his comfort and safety. I feel responsible for protecting him.

The idea of him being home alone is destroying me and making me so anxious. 
For 18 years of my life, I heard from my father to be careful with everything, to lock the door twice so we wouldn't get robbed. To turn off all electronics from the sockets when I leave so they wouldn't start a fire...(but repeatedly he was also angry and yelling). Be careful, be careful. It's nice, but combined with the traumas he gave me and everything..I'm just paranoid (also OCD + ADHD and my therapist suspects autism and BPD or bipolar disorder...) it's just overwhelming and exhausting, and I'll still have to look for a psychiatrist because the therapist said it was the best idea.

I don't mind checking things to see if they're okay. But he was...Check again, don’t trust, something bad could happen... I feel like If I relax, something will go wrong, like If I lose control, disaster happens. I've also been in alert (...) in the last few months, it's called hyperviglance? I'm not sure.

Just, when I imagine not being careful for once, not checking, not guarding, not anticipating disaster, I get so massively scared. Also, if I lost him, I'll be like losing a child. Literally. His my baby.

The fear of losing him feel so intense that it makes my chest tight, I'm panicky and the feeling is so unbearable. I can't even stop touching him, I feel like some force will pull him out of my hands. I'm literally curled around him most of the time when I'm alone. I'm worried that if I let go, something terrible happens.

Father was also always saying and repeating that we're being watched, doesn't matter how, just watched (and eavesdropped).

Front mobile cameras, computers, PCs, cameras, satellites, UFOs, that in the night they're watching you for 18 years.

(Warning for further text, please, I don't want sound crazy but)
About an hour ago I felt really really bad and threatened, I had to stand up and walked to the window, opening it and watching outside if there's something or nothing. I was looking at the sky mostly because I felt like if a spaceship is there (judging allowed), that they're there. I have bird seeds on the windowsill, I took some and threw them up in the direction where I felt someone was watching me.

Father always said that advanced alien technology has the ability to make their spaceships invisible. Like that scene in AvP ('04) in the end.

I feel threatened and my puppy is twice as much at risk, he's small and vulnerable. 

I feel like the danger is everywhere, I was taught that invisible forces exist. I feel like a safety is impossible (also from trauma but that would be too long writing) and that the vigilance is necessary. 

I'm alone in my dorm room rn with my puppy. I don't want to be schizophrenic. I don't want to so bad but I heard father's bullshit for 18 years and I was 20 in November and we live without him only for 2 years. It's so hard to just...stop to think like this. I don't actually know how schizophrenia works, but the idea scares me.

And back to my puppy... I'm keeping him safe now, my puppy, I feel like being his mother, keep him safe because something may take him. I must protect him or everything falls apart. I love him too much, so much as my own.

So...maybe the question (finally) is it harmful for me to love plushie so much? To get attached to him so bad? Like, what will be with him if I d\*e??",1765390902.0,anxiety

Im currently extremely scared of having another panic episode, because i only recovered from the last one a few weeks ago. I just need some outside reassurance that this is a singular event, and that it doesnt mean everything will go to shit.

I started taking clonazepam on the 25. of October after being in a constant panic state for 6 months. (Aside from two 2 week intermissions inbetween)

It was incredibly effective and I hadn't had any panic attacks since, and stopped taking it after 4-5 weeks, continuing without panic attacks.

The past 7 days, I have slept horribly, pulling two all-nighters and only getting one night with more than 4 hours of sleep. I've suffered from insomnia for a very long time and I take medication, but sometimes it just be like that.

I know though, that not getting enough sleep always 

causes panic, and then I sleep even less because I'm scared, and then I panic more. 

I thought it would be okay this time because I had been doing well for a few weeks, and then suddenly, it appeared again. It was more the constant fear in the background sending me into fight or flight, that things would get bad again. But today I had a micro panic attack again, and I cant shake the feeling that the panic has come to fuck me over again.

It feels like hell because my throat has never been affected in this way before. I basically get a weird feeling, like a very mild feeling of impending doom and suddenly it feels as though my throat's been sprayed.

What really terrifies me is what happens after I panic, which is usually a long spiral that lasts hours to even days on how I’m never going to get better, stuck like this, etc. 

If anyone has any advice for that part of panic, that would really help. The anxiety and rumination that comes after the attack is WAY worse for me than the attack itself. I also have OCD, which probably contributes, but just seeing if there’s anyone else out there like this. If so, and you’ve found some tips or tricks, please let me know.

Thanks",1765831436.0,panicdisorder
1pn7dur,Mirtazapine ontop of Fluoxetine for anxiety,"Hey everyone,  
I recently saw my doctor because my anxiety has been pretty heightened lately (panic attacks, disassociation, dizziness, nausea) . I’m a 39-year old female and I’m also in trauma therapy at the moment, which has been intense but helpful. My doctor has prescribed 15mg of mirtazapine in addition to my 40mg of fluoxetine, as he doesn’t want me to come off the fluoxetine just yet.

I struggle with anxiety mostly during the day, starting as soon as I wake up, and I’m hoping this combination might help.

I’d really love to hear some positive experiences with mirtazapine, or with this combination specifically. How did it affect your anxiety or mood throughout the day? Any tips for managing the adjustment period?

Thanks in advance.",1765805424.0,panicdisorder
1pn6uzu,starting a job after 2 years today,"tldr; im starting a new job after 2 years of slight agoraphobia and straight panic and am terrified. its as a recess/lunch aide for 3 hours everyday at my old elementary school.

  
hi im 21F and I wanted to share this big win for me. It does not feel like much of a win yet because I am convinced I won't last long, but im trying to push through. I start work today in a few hours at my old elementary school as a recess/lunch aide. I am terrified, although it seems like the perfect job for my case. It's mostly outside, only 3 hours and somewhere I know and I have a sibling there too. 

Im trying so hard to ""play it cool"" in my head that its no biggie and not serious, which is working bc again its only 3 hours and I NEED a job, but I can feel all the pressure on me from family, so im even more terrified of it bc of disappointing them if I run away from it. 

My main issues right now are that the principal is actually my middle school principal that did not like me because of a LOT of middle school drama, I do have some negative feelings towards the place besides just nostalgia, im terrified of feeling trapped or having a sensory meltdown in the cafeteria or indoor recess because of how loud it is. Im terrified of a school shooting. All in all, im just terrified of having a panic attack and self sabotaging It all for myself and proving to the voice in my head that its right about me. Yes, I am unmedicated completely bc I do not have health insurance right now until January.

For some positivity to end this, It is ONLY 3 hours, It is the best starting job to get during this issue of mine, feeling nervous is NORMAL and I can handle it, having a panic attack or dpdr is NORMAL for my situation and ill survive like I have a million times. Change is SUPPOSED to be uncomfortable and scary and I NEED this change to have a functional life again and make money. Even if I run away, I will still have to do this all over again at a different job, but it will only get harder and harder. ",1765803921.0,panicdisorder

1pmwjmo,"Hello Everyone, I need advice","I’m 25 years old, a male if that matters. 

I never really dealt with panic attacks before this year, in February, my Momma passed away, very quickly. I had to watch her physically decline everyday, take care of her, and then she took her last breath in my arms, I even did her postmortem care. Me and her were best friends, always together, had each other’s back. But now she’s gone. 

So up till recently, I only had a hand full of panic attacks, but ever since October, they been consistent, everyday. I’m talking, heart beating to like 160 while standing there, hot flashes, sweats, feeling like I’m not even there, or if anything around me is real. Like I’m going to just drop. This has taken a toll on me heavily. I had to miss a month of work because of it.

I went back to work early November, then about two weeks ago returning, they’re back, back in full force. I go to my doctor, he threw a script of Klonopin at me and wished me good luck.

Today, had a panic attack in the shower, for some reason, a shower is a big trigger for my panics, sometimes I have to bolt right out of it without finishing it. I went to work, to try to keep on pushing, walking down the hall, then boom, I feel like I’m going to drop, I stand there, look down at my watch. Yeah my heart is going 150 BPM. I keep it pushing, answer a residents call like, in the middle of their care, it happened again, I keep persisting, then I’m just sitting, calming down. Not even 5 minutes later, it starts up again. 

I had to leave work, I’m very disappointed in myself, I was doing so good, going to work, staying the full shift, but tonight I left. Everyone says breathe through it or work through it, ignore it.

Ive been suffering from panic disorder since i was very young (maybe 13-14) this has hindered my life and opportunities a great deal. It started out once every couple of months. At the time i had no idea how to describe what i was feeling so i called them headaches. What i ultimately was feeling after alot of psychological imput was anxiety attacks w/ depersonalization. I was so impacted by the depersonalization effects that i started to retreat and avoid situations and places all together. For a time I became very agoraphobic. Ive been on SSRIs (currently 250mg daily of sertraline generic zoloft) for a long time w/ 1mg clonozapam daily for over 15 years. Ive began to see how its affected my brain (memory, some cognitive function, lack of creativity, sex drive) the clonozapam has always been a staple but ive switched SSRIs a few times because of them ceasing to work affectively. Also ive never really stopped getting these episodes just have become more manageable. Recently my symptoms of depersonalization have come back, and i find myself retreating back into old habits. I dont have insurance or a support system like i had in my youth. My meds and Psych appts have been all self funded for at least 12-14 years and i need some advice on how people have dealt with depersonalization successfully. Specific meds? Therapy?

I couldn’t even change my clothes or shower without it sending me into panic or adrenaline dumps. I woke up at 8am every single morning, woke up with severe dread and panic.

I have panic disorder - the panic attacks where I start shaking uncontrollably, can’t move, can’t breathe, hyperventilation, hands and feet clamp up, etc. Usually I take a .25 or Klonopin and can feel better within an hour at least the shaking and muscle spasms subside. However I normally know when they’re coming and can stop them in their tracks. The problem I’m having, and having tonight at 3am is when I’m violently awakened by a full blown one. It’s the most excruciating feeling, and very hard to come out of by myself. Even after taking the medication. The dread is overwhelming and I become desperate for any type of human contact. I desperately knock on my housemates doors sometimes, and if I’m luckily someone will be up to just be with me, which makes me feel some sort of support and less alone. Tonight was not one of those nights and I’m struggling. I’m close to ubering to the hospital just to be with a human. Does anyone have any advice for when there’s no one to help or just be there for you? Dos anyone else get that feeling like they just need someone to be there as if I know I’m going to die and want to make sure someone knows or can call an ambulance?

I’ve been to the hospitals and drs numerous times since 2023 with bloodwork and other tests which never came back badly or different. I make myself short of breath and panic and my body can only focus on the physical feeling. Cardiophobia is my nightmare.

1pitquw,Finally healing from my Panic disorder and Somatic OCD :),"Hello everyone,

Its been 3 years now that i've been suffering from a Panic Disorder and Somatic OCD, and i guess i really wanted to get this out and finally be able to express myself and what i went thru and hope that my post can help others suffering from this combination feel less alone and hopeful about their future, and share my progress with you all as im very proud of what i have achieved for the past 6 months but i have no one to share it with.

I'm 23 and most of my life i have always been fairly normal, except for my social anxiety as a teenager which i guess started all of this unconsciously. Ive never thought once in my life that it would get this bad and id be dealing with this hell of a disorder.

3 years ago is when everything started, one day i started noticing my breathing and i couldn't stop noticing it which lead me to start breathing manually... at first it was fine as i thought it would go away on its own but it never did and i found myself breathing manually for 70% of the day, i couldn't sleep and i couldn't talk to people at all which made me thought i would be like this for the rest of my life, i would never be able to breathe automatically again...

This experience lead me to develop the panic disorder, everytime i was breathing manually, so many about 15k times a day i would panic cause i thought this would never end and i broke myself, and in the span of 6 months it became so deeply ingrained that it essentially became a pattern.

After 6 month the manual breathing went away, as in 2022 chatgpt came along and i was finally able to get a tool where it could give me direct advice and understand it and it gave me solid advice to just not fight it and let it happen and it worked.

but the panic stayed as my brain made it a new baseline to panic every-time i breathed like conditioning, and i was experiencing a panic attack about every 10 minutes or so and everytime i breathed every day for the next 2 years, it was horrible, i think everyone here knows how it feels like so i don't really have to describe it.. but it was hell, nothing worked to stop it.

6 months ago i finally started seeking therapy for it and my therapist recommended me ACT and Exposure therapy, where you accept the feelings and let it happen and expose your brain to it until it becomes desensitized to it on its own, and it has finally been able to break me out of this hell, i fought so hard, every day to expose myself to the panic, to different triggers and now although i still have it, i am able to function normally despite the panic attacks being here from times to times and im able to make it background noise and know that nothing will happen to me.. its so freeing to finally get myself back, my freedom and being able to do things knowing it cant hurt me..

i saw a huge reduction in the frequency of when it happens, from like every 10 minutes to every 4-5 hours or so and when it happens now it subsides quickly like after 30 seconds or a minute, i only get peaks now and it goes away.

Im very proud of myself from what ive accomplished and i keep looking forward to my future, and finding my peace, and i hope that anyone else suffering from this does too, just know there is a light at the end of it and i hope you all find your light, its hard but we are incredibly strong, its a horrible disorder and yet we are still here and still fighting, we are genuinely very strong and this strength will be a sort of gift once healed :)

Ever since I have been stuck in a perpetual state of panic, and I have at least 1-3 bigger panic attacks a day, and am constantly stuck in pre panic intense anxiety. I’ve become scared to go back to work because that’s where it all happened. I have panic attacks driving to work, being at work, and driving home. I luckily work hybrid 3 days at home a week, but those 2 days I can barely make it through. I even get anxious working at home simply because I am DOING my job. Does anyone have any advice on healing after a traumatic panic attack? Especially in how I can be not scared to go to work again. I have therapy on Wednesday so I will mention this, but I’m just curious if anyone else has any advice. ",1765169558.0,panicdisorder

1pghpi5,"just need to know I’ll be okay, I’m freaking out","I’m a 25-year-old female, and for the past 6 months I’ve been dealing with intense anxiety and panic episodes. I’ve had about 3 full panic attacks so far — the most recent one happened just two days ago, around 4 AM. I woke up from what felt like sleep paralysis, and it spiraled into days of extreme health anxiety afterward.

My legs and hands were shaking, and I made the mistake of googling symptoms (I know I shouldn’t), came across ALS, and convinced myself I was going to end up paralyzed. That thought sent me into a complete panic spiral. When I got up from bed, my legs felt shaky, my heart was racing, I felt dizzy, and there was this overwhelming sense of doom like this is it, I’m dying. It felt like a heart attack. I live alone and had no one to call, just my cat with me, and I’ve never felt that scared before.

Deep down I know it’s anxiety, and even my psychiatrist has told me not to google or search symptoms, but I keep falling into it. One day I think it’s cancer, another day stroke, ALS, etc. Most of the time it turns out to be nothing serious, just anxiety flaring up… but it feels so real in the moment.

This whole thing has been affecting my life in a big way. I skipped classes this semester because I couldn’t bring myself to attend. Crowds scare me, public transport scares me, I barely went out with friends. I feel like I’m stuck in my room and stuck in my own mind. The worst part is not being able to explain it to people — they don’t understand, and it’s not their fault, but it’s so isolating.

I just want to know… does it get better?
Has anyone else gone through something like this and come out the other side? I’m exhausted. I want my life, my career, and my confidence back. I don’t want to live in fear anymore.

Any advice, reassurance, or shared experiences would mean a lot. Thank you for reading.",1765112133.0,panicdisorder
1pgai91,ADHD/autism masking as panic disorder?,"I'm 30F and have had anxiety/panic attacks since I was a child. 

I have been reflecting a lot on how I've had treatment resistant panic and anxiety for the majority of my life, I've been considering whether I have been neurodivergent this entire time, and my lived experience has just been a constant battle of feeling overstimulated, overwhelmed, and no one really understanding why. 

I have all of the symptoms of ADHD, I fidget constantly, struggle with focus, have extreme rejection sensitivity, struggle to learn didactically and have poor working memory. 

I do however, have very fast processing speed and verbal comprehension and have intense hyperfixations so I'm academic and am also risk averse, so I was never the ""naughty kid getting bad grades"" at school like other children with ADHD issues. 

My parents used shame as a motivator for behaviour change, and so I've mostly just used fear and shame as my mechanism for helping me push through my school work and leveraging on hyperfixations. This obviously has made my life look functional, but I have explosions of panic attacks that occur every 12 months on average. 

I think I may have just been labelled as anxious and that became a vicious cycle making my panic attacks worse because I've been trying to treat them via a neurotypical framework only. And now I just have this intense issue with shame and feeling different.

1pb0phx,Panic attacks gone off dairy… reintro brought them back,"Hi there,

I just wanted to share my story.

Since I was a toddler I had anxiety/panic issues. I’d beg my Mom to wait outside my room until I fell asleep, not because of paranormal reasons, just because I had genuine unknown fear, and her being there wouldn’t give me comfort but it would at the same time. And I’ve dealt with ADHD symptoms on top of my panic attacks, and also a weird feeling of stabbing pins and needles in my tongue which would cause me to tear up.

My whole life, I’ve had ups and downs of me freaking out when it’s night time, acne which worsened panic, and living on a farm for a lot of my childhood/adolescence didn’t help with all of it.

Essentially, without getting into grave detail, I started working out at 16 (I’m 23 now), and began to get self conscious about how I looked and my main initial motivation for working out was to make myself attractive enough so that I might have a future chance with the girl who just rejected me. That motivation lingered but my main goal switched to just being healthy and strong.

I changed my diet a lot, and I’d occasionally notice that my anxiety would drop to almost 0. Two instances were:
1) I went meat only for a month. I felt euphoric by day 28.
2) I switched to plant based protein powder. My confidence and clarity skyrocketed.

Recently, I fasted for a week, and then ate like 1-2tbsp of goat cheese, and I had a near instant tongue stabbing episode, and I was terrified that my tongue was going to swell up, and had like a day long panic attack too.

So, I cut out all amounts of dairy, along with gluten, chicken and chicken eggs about 30 days ago. And I made changes to my diet, so that I get a ton of water, and high electrolytes of the main three (sodium, potassium, magnesium). And I take a lot of D3. And I get roughly 111g of protein without going crazy on calories.

(Btw — for the last three months I’ve been completely housebound because the last three times I tried to drive I had massive panic attacks)

It’s been insane. My focus is starting to creep back, my panic and forgetfulness/adhd symptoms are dropping. 

And exactly 7 days ago, I tried reintroducing dairy again as an experiment (to isolate variable), and within 1 hour I had a panic attack that made me feel like I couldn’t escape. And I felt numb in the head. And my nighttime freakouts came back for the next 4-5 days.

Now that the dairy symptoms are manageable enough to feel kind of like myself, I wanted to write this in case anyone noticed they would feel panic flare ups after eating sometimes. That might be the issue.

And I used to smoke a lot of weed at 17-20, and when I was 20 I fasted for a month, then ate a cheesesteak sandwich, and then smoked a joint, and had the worst panic attack of my life. Basically I’m linking my panic symptoms to diet because I want to smoke weed again and have it feel good like it used to, and with almost 100% certainty found the answer/reason for my panic symptoms.

I’m getting blood IgE testing soon to confirm, but the elimination/re-challenge results are already undeniable.

I’m writing this as I need some advice / a virtual hug. For context I am a 20yr F.

At the end of October I went on a holiday with my partner and his friends we took a plane for this trip (about an hour) I slept horribly the night before and started feeling dizzy and faint and just put it off to be being tired and wanting to sleep. The holiday went on fine until the day before we were due to come home. I got so overwhelmed and anxious in anticipation for the flight home I was having panic attacks and crying the night + day of going home I felt so unwell and just wanted to be home. We got back and I thought I would be fine as soon as I got home but I wasn’t. I kept on crying and wasn’t ok I thought I just needed to go to sleep. I woke up the next day after getting back thinking I’d be ok but I wasn’t my partner drove me to my parents house and I’m staying there. The first 2 weeks of November I thought that I’d be fine and just needed to calm down but it just got worse I had such bad anxiety and dpdr, I felt dizzy and off balance It felt as though something could change or my surrounds would change but I knew they weren’t I didn’t want to speak to anyone as I felt speaking and the concept of it made me feel weird. My mother booked me a drs appointment and I was so anxious for this I spent 3 days before hand a crying mess. I pushed myself and went it was hard I had been to this dr clinic before I knew it was all the same and everything I was just so anxious I cried to the doctor I felt so horrible. (For context I’m already on 10mg of lexapro and have been for about 5 years, I got on it for bad anxiety and I haven’t experienced dpdr before and I got better) the Dr upped my lexapro from 10mg to 20mg and gave me 10 valliums she also put me on a mental health plan so that I could see a psychologist which I am due to see in mid December. I am so scared that I will never be able to go back home to my partner or see my friends again or leave my house. I went to my house with my mother yesterday to collect my clothes, I was fine but my anxiety was so bad that I just didn’t want to leave. I’m so scared that I’ll be stuck like this forever I want nothing more than to get better and be able to live my life again but it just feels impossible in this moment.

1pa5bwc,This is what a panic relapse feels like right now,"I’m in a bad panic flare right now. It’s another PAD relapse. I’ve had these cycles for 20 years, and I’m now 42 years old.

Lately, my baseline is anxiety with daily panic attacks layered on top of it. Some of the attacks are manageable and minor nuisances; I can ground myself while experiencing them. Some take over my mind and whole body so intensely that I recently called 911. 

I’ve had years in the past when panic attack disorder lets up and gets less heavy. It usually takes intense regimens of CBT to accomplish this. It does work for months, a few times a year. This time it came back and has really stayed. I’ve not been able to shake it.

I’ve had some very big life changes recently. My relationship ended, and we started co-parenting for our 3-year-old. So I’ve recently moved out and started rebuilding. I received a promotion at work, which is great and what I wanted. But the reality of the position is not at all in line with what I did to get there. None of this is too much for me by itself. But as a whole, my nervous system hasn’t kept up with all the changes. 

One thing that’s been hard to admit is how complicated “help” becomes when I unconsciously begin relying on it. My safety behaviors are turning into crutches. Support from loved ones and hotlines is slowly turning into total dependence. 

My interoception is through the roof. What was healthy awareness has turned into hypervigilant monitoring. Data from wearables has become obsession. I have so many great tools designed to keep me safe and should be reassuring, but they have begun to quietly convince me that my body is in danger everywhere.

The anticipation is so much to bear. My body is always waiting for something that never quite arrives.

There is one sentence I try to consider and come back to throughout the day:

“This is discomfort, not danger.”

I’m grateful though, because I’m fortunate that between episodes, I have no depression or hopelessness. I love my life and all that it has to offer. It’s in these attacks that I can’t see straight.

So right now what I’m holding onto is the difference between what’s happening in my body and who I actually am.

1p8o3j8,Advice for existential panic and dread,"A couple years ago i developed panic disorder and it was existentialism that was the most terrifying for me, I got so stuck in trying to figure out all those big terrifying questions that felt even scarier whilst in that state of panic. If that is where you’re at, drowning in the overwhelming fear and dread then you need to take a step back, there is no thinking you way through it when you’re stuck in the fear. From experience the best thing you can do is connect, connect with anything, nature or a friend, express yourself, move your body. The spiral gets so intense when it remains so purely in your mind and it’s not to say distract yourself and never think about existentialism again but you need to approach it with a calm nervous system. So rather than trying to answer an unanswerable question get out of your brain and try to interact with the world till it feels less scary to approach. I promise that it all feels so much less terrifying when your body can calm.

It’s wild how you can wake up thinking you’re fine, thinking life is more or less steady, and then out of nowhere panic hits like a sucker punch. You try every coping skill therapy ever taught you, but your body has its own agenda.

Getting diagnosed and doing the work has taken a lot of that weight off. I’m kinder to myself now. I don’t spiral into that same shame, but there’s still a tiny part of me that wishes I could just be “normal.”

1p8fgup,I give up. I need hope/advice.,"Hello. I write because this january my life got turned upside down. My post history has all the details as I vented my frustrations in other posts. But long story short... I got h pylori, got treated by strong antibiotics, and my entire GI system went crazy.

This experience left me kinda traumatized, so I got in contact with my psychiatrist. I was off all meds for more than 7-8 months by then. He suggested to start taking escitalopram (lexapro) again like in the past, and I did. The problem is that my sensitive stomach was not tolerating it anymore.

I would get panic attacks, reflux, interactions with my ppi medication, my stomach would be all over the place... I stopped functioning, although it did improve my mood and helped me survive as long as I have. I ended up taking it for 3 months and at minimum dose (5mg), but then I decided to work with a therapist and remove the medication so that at least I could go back to my previous baseline and get some relief with only my PPI. I did a quick 1 week taper and stopped it.

I did feel better, but it was quite short lived, and would come and go. Ever since I stopped that I started developing dozens of new symptoms, from more upset stomach and bowels, to insomnia, shakiness, chronic cough, vertigo, electric feelings and spasms... Things I didn't have before getting on this medication.

More or less I could handle it and sleep soundly through the night, telling myself it would be ok. But ever since 2 weeks ago, 4 months after my last pill, that I started getting super reactive. I woke up one night with uncontrollable thoughts, which triggered a full blown panic attack. Thinking I was dying, I ended up in the ER.

Ever since that I can't live anymore... Everything gets my heart rate high. Eating, getting up too fast, thinking, work... Today I had lunch, and my blood pressure skyrocketed to 160-130 right after my first plate, which sent me into panic and ended up in the ER again before I could finish my meal.

I've been the whole year going from doctor to doctor because of my stomach, but now this hyper sensitivity also appeared and don't know what to do... I have diazepam 5mg to use as needed, but I really don't want to rely on an habit forming medication 😅

What should I do? I feel like doctors aren't helping me. I don't want to go through the pain of taking SSRI again, or using benzos... Are there alternatives or something? I've tried to distract myself with games or sudokus, relaxing music, therapy, guided meditations, going for a walk... But I can't lower my heart rate for the life of me...

TL;DR: Had a hard year, digestive system and life in general gets messed up with antibiotics due to h pylori. Take escitalopram 5mg alongside therapy, body does not agree with medication, leave escitalopram with fast 1 week taper at the 3 month mark. Things progressively get worse than baseline pre-meds. Now 4 months off meds, and 11 months of suffering later, I can't control my fight or flight system as it seems to be pumping 24/7, with fast heart rate and shaking all day. Being a cardiophobe I can't stop obsessing over it and don't want to go back to ssri or benzos, so i'm looking for opinions on what to do.",1764284467.0,panicdisorder

1p7sg02,Starting a new job for the first time in 6 months,"I am a 20 yo male that has been going through terrible panic disorder and health anxiety all my life but recently it has gotten unbearable. 

TLDR - Bad mushroom trip made my extreme anxiety and panic attacks come back after suppressing everything other than depression with weed for years. 

It started it January 2024 after said mushroom trip and I’ve been going through it ever since. One tiny ache or pain can turn into anxiety and panic. What if this or what if that. I’ve gotten way better but after working at Amazon and getting treated like shit and doing things I wasn’t comfortable doing I quit. 

I’ve been unemployed since July 2025, just trying to figure out and improve my mental health. I’ve gotten better with some stuff, but at the same time I’ve gotten a little agoraphobia from it. Terrified to even drive or go anywhere sometimes. Lately I told myself I need to just take a fucking leap or I’ll be stuck like this forever. 

My friend has been talking about working at a dealership with his dad for years, recently he has started the process after getting his Drivers License. He told me that I could be a Photo Tech/ Photographer since the guy working in that position is leaving, if the interview goes well I get the job. But I pretty much have the job.

I’m terrified. What if I get air hunger? What if I get chest pressure? Stomach pains? Heart palpitations? Brain fog? DRPR? 

I’m absolutely terrified. I need to make my own money, but I’m scared I’m going to fuck it up or panic at the job? What can I do to help this anxiety? I have prescribed Xanax and some coping mechanisms but most of them are for home use. I’m scared I’m going to fuck this up and lose my one chance at a normal life again.

TLDR- Scared about a new job after almost 2 years of health anxiety and panic attacks. Need advice. ",1764216105.0,panicdisorder
1p7e0rp,Can’t stop panicking and I need advice,"So I have pretty bad panic disorder and agoraphobia. I’ll leave my house but only to go to certain safe places. I did a Favor for a friend who doesn’t have an eBay account and I sold a video game console for him. I should have just marked it as non hazardous when I printed the label but it had lithium ion batteries in it, so I did the right thing and chose the package contained hazardous materials and chose lithium ion batteries from the drop down. The label printed out and said hazardous and can go ground only so I thought cool I did it right. USPS picked up the package from my house and 2 hours later the call me and say I need to come down there and put a hazardous sticker on the side of the box denoting which hazard is in there (I looked it up and found the sticker I need to use)

The problem is I can’t stop panicking and freaking out one because I regret not just shipping it out and choosing non hazardous and this would be a non issue and two because the thought of going to the post office and waiting in line and then having to explain why I’m there etc has sent me into a panic and I’m spiraling and can’t stop replaying the scenario in my head and my heart is racing etc. I called them and asked id they could please just return the package to my house and I would eat the cost of the shipping label print a new one and put the proper stickers on it but they are refusing saying they can’t handle the package and I need to pick it up which sent me into another panic attack. If this was just a $50 item I would just say screw it and tell them to throw it away and eat the $50 but it was a $400 sale for my friend. 

It just sucks that something so simple as going 1.5 miles to the post office and getting in line and taking 1 min to explain why I’m there and slapping a sticker on the side of the box is such a daunting and impossible task for me. I feel like such a loser and I don’t know how I’m going to get down there and do it without shaking and my heart racing at 160 and feeling like I’m gonna pass out. I feel so defeated and now I’m just ruminating about the whole situation and why didn’t I just ship it out like I have with other electronics and not choose hazardous materials. Ugh

1p6cgzc,Panic attack sufferers who are paradoxically calm in crisis?,"Hey there, wondering if there are other people who can relate. I have panic disorder, depression, ex agoraphobe and also OCD with pure OCD themes and periods.

I find that I get terrible debilitating panic attacks, symptoms, thoughts and feelings due to no reason or ""made up reasons"" such as stupid OCD themes or panic itself. 

Yet when times are tough, such as in a crisis situation I am calm? I do what I need to do, my bodily symptoms aren't too bad and I stay focused. My anxiety and panic is lower. Only in the aftermath does it all hit me like a stress laden train. 

It actually makes me feel guilty, as though I react to my own bullshit in my head, more than real stuff. But I guess it's more helpful to those around me that I stay calm at least...

1p5960s,My kid got me sick and I apparently have reactive asthma,"I am not doing well. I'm getting flashes of feelings I had like back when I still use to smoke bud or when I had bad ptsd from an ex and was in shock for months. My breathing seems to be doing better but it was all triggered a few days ago. 

I did not understand why when I would get up to use the rest room I would get SO anxious and on brink of a huge panic attack. Pulse that normally was at 74 was resting at 100-117 on my propranolol. I attempted to go to work and my manager sent me home so I decided to go to the walk in to get a note to excuse my absence. I am stressed about missing work and figured whatever I can do to help not panic and feel like I'm letting anyone down... he said my lungs sounded awful and I'm dealing with athsma. I was super confused. I have had exercise induced asthma growing up but never heard of reactive asthma. He wanted me on prednisone and that made me panic more, at this point I was getting the sweats and was feeling trapped. I explained to him that last time I took it it was not good for me. I had a high heart rate, kept getting panic attacks and almost had to go to the er due to my blood pressure being stupid high and was hot and sweaty. He then said we'll your asthma is really bad sounding agitated. Bedside manner is not his strong suit it seems as any doc should know asthma makes people panic already and I have panic disorder on top of it. Anyways I told him I would be diligent on using my inhaler even if it raises my pulse so I would feel better and he said if it gets worse to go to the er. 

My oxygen has been doing well 96 and above. I've been taking mucinex for chest congestion, trying to drink a lot and added water to my cpap machine to help with moisture to help break everything up. I've had multiple showers putting breathe easy essential oil in the corners and doing controlled coughing to help move stuff out but I am still getting huge waves of panic. Mainly at night since everyone is asleep. I get up and I feel so out of it... the feeling that I got when I would smoke long ago that made me stop comes up. It's like... I'm getting swung one direction but not really dizzy. I don't know how better to explain it. It sucks because I am a mother. I have a 6 yr old. I feel like I should have my ish figured out by my age but a little cold can just set me off. To be fair last time I was sick was in July and my kid had gotten covid from daycare and I was not doing well mentally then either and was quite scared. So I think it is just kind of... all snowballing. I'm on zoloft highest dose for depression and anxiety as far as i know. Idk what else to do other than therapy. Which finding a good therapist who takes my insurance has been hell. I also just lost my last parent and just had sent my half sister what I want the headstone to look like and what to be written on it and I am assuming it is effecting me more than I realize? Makes sense timing wise and I have been so sensitive past few days. 

Idk what exactly i am looking for other than maybe someone saying hey me too! I get it! And knowing this is ""normal"" for our amazing lizard brains at least. Writing this out has helped somewhat. For me holding it in and not expressing it and trying to act normal makes it worse. Also another reason why I say my fears outlook to like my coworker I will be like I feel not okay today so if I stop breathing or something call an ambulance lol. Like duh of course they would but luckily they get it as their wife deals with panic attacks pretty badly too and he has as well. But just saying it out there kinda is like cool I'm safe.

1p2os7d,Beta blockers for physical symptoms,"Hi everyone! Quick disclosure before I start: my doctor has already reassured me about this medication, but if you struggle with health anxiety, you know how hard it can be to trust reassurance and try something new.

I deal with intense physical anxiety symptoms — racing heart, shaking, headaches — but only when I have to leave the house. At home, I feel totally fine. My doctor prescribed me propranolol 10mg to help calm those physical symptoms.

Here’s where my anxiety gets in the way:
	•	If I’m at home and not having any symptoms, I’m too afraid to take it because I worry it could slow my heart down too much since it’s already normal.
	•	But if I’m about to go out and I am having symptoms, I’m scared to take it then too — because the idea of trying a new medication while already panicking (and being away from home/hospital access) makes me fear I’ll have side effects and spiral even more.

I’ve been reassured multiple times that 10mg is a very low dose and won’t do anything dangerous to my heart — but the fear still takes over.

So I’m wondering: has anyone taken propranolol before having physical anxiety symptoms, just to see how their body reacts first? Or is it something you should really only take when those symptoms kick in and your heart is racing?

it’s night right now, almost midnight, i can’t sleep because i am constantly shaking, although there are 10-15 minute breaks between them, im not sure when they will stop.
recently i have a had a massive flare up of health anxiety, panic attacks, general anxiety, and tension headaches. i am not able to go to school in the morning because i am constantly shaking and feeling nauseous an extremely worried and anxious.
i find it strange that the panic attacks only seem to occur in the mornings and at night, or before i go to sleep.
the shaking is mostly just in my legs, i am even experiencing it right now.
it is very similar to what i was experiencing about a year ago, but my panic attacks have seemed to have come back after a long break. im not experiencing extremely high heartbeats anymore like the day before yesterday. can anyone else relate to this?

1p1qjvy,Panic attacks can feel like a heart attack?,"I went to the ER last month because one night I had sharp pain in my chest and it freaked me out (more on why later) so my heart was racing and when I went they couldn’t find anything immediately wrong and sent me home.

However something more intense happened last night.

I was pretty sedentary during the day, didn’t feel wonderful because my period is about to start so I was taking it slow. It was around 8 PM and I just gotten back home from getting a fruit bowl, I sat down on the couch, noticing some sharp chest pain, but I didn’t think much of it and figured I just needed to chill out. We were gonna watch something on TV so I got up to go get my glasses from my bedroom and the chest pain got a little worse and I was feeling dizzy. I could feel my heart racing for apparently no reason so I sat back down and figured I needed to just not move for a little bit, but it wasn’t going away. I used a blood pressure monitor to check my blood pressure was elevated a little and my heart rate was 125.

While trying to be as calm as possible, I deemed I should go to the ER because I don’t have family medical history and I had a brother die at 25 (I’m 24F, non smoker, no drinking etc.) from a heart attack and my father just died at 66 from a heart attack, but my dad was a heavy drinker and smoker so maybe that had something to do with it(?)

Anyways, on the way to the ER the pain starts getting worse, sharp stabbing, left side above breast spasming and I’m freaking out because I think this is it. I’m gonna die. it’s also burning like icy hot on the inside. I get to the ER and they take blood and do an x-ray and say they can’t find anything immediately wrong. They also gave me Valium for anxiety and yet before they even gave me that I had started to calm down and my heart rate and blood pressure were back to normal.

They discharged me and told me to follow up with a primary and maybe see a cardiologist so I made an appointment as soon as I could for primary, which is this Friday at 7 AM, but I don’t know what to make of it and I’m a little worried about waiting that long to see the doctor and then have to get a referral and wait and see a cardiologist. I’m kind of just posting here to see if anybody’s been through anything similar and has any sort of comforting words to advise me or if there’s a better option I’m guessing if the pain comes back I’ll just go back to the ER but I’ve been laying in bed all day today scared to get up and my chest has felt sore on the left side.

I do obviously struggle with anxiety, but this felt different and was extremely scary. It’s now Wednesday and my left side chest is still a little sore and the center of my chest feels heavy. It’s been hard to sleep because of the worry of what’s next.

1p1b70h,Panic attack relapse,"Hi,
I have struggled with general anxiety and panic for almost 20 years, and started medication for the first time abou5 4 years ago. (sertraline aka zoloft). It completely changed my life for the better i felt like i was cured, i had virtually zero anxiety. About 8 months ago, I had a few panic attacks, and alot of general anxiety. Over the past 3 months I have increased my dose from 50mg of sertraline to 100mg. I've been on 100mg for about 11 weeks now. I have definitely seen an improvement with the dose increase (much less daily anxiety, no panic, excitement about the future). HOWEVER, last night I had a panic attack. It was milder and shorter than previous ones, but still horrible. Now I cant help but feel like im not getting better. Im waiting for that full 100% recovery i felt the first time I started medication with zero panic/anxiety, but its not coming. Can it ever fully go away? Does this mean I should increase the dose again? Does anyone have a medication dose that works well but they still get panic attacks from time to time?

I'd also like to add, i don't just solely rely on medication. I exercise daily, eat well, don't drink or smoke, attend regular therapy, meditate etc, and I have no desire to go off my medication bc this is still 1000x better than I used to be before medication.",1763567310.0,panicdisorder
1p0yda7,It feels like I’m in hell,"I don’t like to write on Reddit but I feel like I can gain some good insight here. 

I (21F) am autistic and was diagnosed with this and anxiety at a young age. I also have emetophobia. I’ve managed pretty well without physical symptoms when I get overstimulated or panicky. I feel I need to outline my timeline in order to get some perspective on my issues and if anyone can relate. 

When I turned 21 last month, I tried an edible for the first time the weekend after. I greened out terribly because I ate too much while on it, causing terrible nausea but I couldn’t throw up because I have a fear of it. I phased out of the effects after a couple of hours but it was a terrible experience for me.

For the past month after, I would have a similar headache on the weekend, trouble swallowing, and nausea, which would start while I was eating food. Every weekend like clockwork this happened and I would take Tylenol and pray. I also had shaking, burping, inability to swallow, and I would empty all of my bowels and my mouth would just dry up. For reference, I call these episodes. 

Last week, I had an episode on Tuesday, and I stretched my neck out, realizing that it was super tense and that it had been stiff for a VERY long time. So I got into the habit of stretching my neck. The problem is, I had an episode on Saturday where it felt like my neck was being weighed and tense, and I had the usual trouble swallowing and breathing (while eating of course but I hadn’t made this connection yet), face numbness, neck spasms, disoriented, trouble speaking, ear pressure, and for the first time, I noticed my anxiety. The pain wouldn’t go away with the Tylenol which I also realized that day. These episodes would last around 2-3 hours. 

Then, yesterday, I had an appointment with the clinic. The doctor diagnosed me with anxiety and said my physical symptoms are interconnected with it. She told me to journal my usual feelings when I have an attack in order to figure out what my trigger is. So I sit down and journal and I realize that the common trigger is food! So I think it’s over and done with, no more panic attacks. Wrong! I got one while making dinner but I thought I breathed though it enough to eat my food and the symptoms completely went awayThen, I’m laying down for bed a couple hours later. Mucus gets stuck in my throat and it triggers a REALLY bad panic attack that makes me feel like I’m dying and my brain is shutting down. I have tea, watch tv, sleep with my neck on a heating pad (which helps). 

I woke up for work this morning, felt amazing. This was 4 am. I progressively get another panic attack and I’m completely alone here. The only thing that works is “sleeping”. The problem is, I can’t sleep during these episodes but I always get super tired after. The episode subsides, and I take a nap after work. I feel really good after my nap, then I go to a public dining hall and when I look at the food and take in the atmosphere, I feel my stomach muscles contract and I start to panic and I feel the same symptoms as before. I get over them within 30 minutes. 

I am currently recovering from a panic attack right now. It started 3 hours ago with me doing dishes and getting hot flashes. Then I sit down to eat and all hell breaks loose. My mouth is so dry right now, my neck would jolt to where I’d temporarily stop breathing and it felt like death. I felt so tired. I am so very tired but my body is still in panic. I thought figuring out my trigger would help but I’m in a constant state of panic. I was referred for counseling and anxiety meds and I try to affirm that it’s all in my head, do the breathing techniques and coping skills but nothing works. I just want to know if I’m alone here. Any response helps. Thank you.

I have a long history of anxiety attacks, but today was the first moment in time that I had a trauma-triggered panic attack. I tried to push it off because I didn’t realize it was going to escalate, and was at the sink scrubbing stains out of clothes. My husband came in behind me to keep trying to understand what was wrong, he could sense it, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. I started hyperventilating, struggling to keep my eyes open, sobbing hysterically, and all I wanted was to keep scrubbing stains. He wrapped me in a hug and got me to the couch where I felt like I was just frozen, literally frozen, I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t move, I couldn’t formulate thought. 

He got me to lay down for a bit and I struggled to move to get myself up and started crying out of frustration of the inability to talk and move. I finally got up, went to the bathroom, took my emergency medicine and came back and motioned for his phone. 

I still couldn’t verbalize anything but I could not leave him in the dark so in very broken sentences I just typed out that my trauma had been triggered and it’s not him (he’s actually the most loving and caring human in the world and his love makes staying alive worth it). I’m very slowly coming out of it and just looking for any advice for how to recognize the signs before it gets to me completely freezing and what works while you’re in the thick of it to help bring you back to functioning.

I have a lot of health anxiety still, but I’m really trying to just tell myself it’s just anxiety and stress. 

I started taking new anxiety medicine and propanolol (for migraine prevention and to help with some of the physical symptoms).

1oxdcaj,Is this really panic or something else,"Hi all, I wanted to come on here after being a lurker for a long time to seek out some validation. I know I have had panic disorder with DPDR my entire life on and off, some periods of time are good and stable and others are really difficult. I am currently in a hellish period where every aspect of my life is suffering due to the cycle. It started over the summer when I began having a lot of weird DPDR issues. It was extremely distressing to me because it felt like I wasn't real, like I was not the one looking through my own eyes. Trying to explain that to people made it extra hard. I had panic attacks on and off during it, but the main issue was just the weirdness from DPDR and the obsessiveness over it.

I was actually really successful in being able to work through that though. I did a lot of things in the last few months I never thought I would be able to do while having those feelings. Unfortunately, due to a medication taper, I got triggered into a really intense panic cycle and my mind is making me believe it is something more nefarious than just panic.

I feel absolutely unable to sit with people and hold a conversation. I can't fully describe the feelings to the extent I want to, but it feels like mainly, I am losing control of my bodily functions. I feel like I am either going to pass out, have a seizure, or explode. It feels like my body is wrong. I feel like I am jumping out of my skin because of the wrongness Things around be don't feel right or how they should be, and I have this never ending impending doom that I am about to lose my shit. It's like this agitation that comes deep inside of me and makes functioning impossible. The only thing that keeps me semi-calm is just lying down and being on my phone. Which ends up making me feel worse. I know reading this back, it does sound like panic. But there is something inside me saying that it's something different, but I don't know what else it would be. I need to know if any of you have ever felt this way. Because I don't get ""traditional"" panic attack symptoms, where I am short of breath and my chest is tight. It just feels like I am outside my body, and something is WRONG but I have no idea how to describe it. Then my head feels a big pressure inside it and I feel off kilter and dizzy. The thought of having to sit in one place is way too much to handle during it.

I have a prescription for xanax but I am terrified to take it because if I take it and it doesn't make me feel better, I feel like I will be hopeless. I just started Prozac yesterday so I am hoping it helps. I sometimes take a 10 mg of propranolol but it makes my head feel weird af, like I am disconnected from my head and body.

I’m stable, I work two jobs, I’m a wife and mom, I travel, I function like a normal person (usually).

But because the meds block the physical symptoms, my panic attacks feel totally different now. I don’t get the racing heart or shaking anymore, which is great… but now they come on as this weird, sudden wave of dread that’s honestly harder to identify in the moment.

It feels like:

* this random “something is very wrong” feeling
* like I want to crawl out of my skin
* the world feels surreal, dark or unsafe
* I get this intense discomfort where I wish I could just sleep it off or disappear for a minute
* like I’m about to die but without the obvious physical signs
* Strong urge to reach out to others for help. Texting or calling friends/family. 



I had one yesterday — lasted about 30 minutes — and then I literally just went on with my day and even went to work afterward. So clearly they do end, but in the moment it feels impossible to believe that.

Please read the rest of the post for background and specific symptoms.



====



Hi guys. I have a psychiatrist appointment today, and im not looking for medical advice, but wondering if yall have any personal experience with the issues or medication im talking about here so I can get an idea of what peoples experiences where.

I don't post here much except some comments because ive been mostly treated for PD. Quick background around 4 years ago I started having panic attacks, largely because I was smoking weed alot and the stimulation and heartrate increase was making me freak out, etc. Even after I stopped I had severe anxiety about my heart and thought I was dying all the time(typical panic attack stuff). Psychiatrist prescribed 75 mg zoloft, about 3-4 months later I felt mostly better. Couple years after that I thought I could be without zoloft, because I didnt have panic attacks anymore and I thought it was giving me brain fog and dissociation, etc. 3 months later panic attacks again, metal clarity and brain fog never fixed, went back on 25mg Zoloft, feel fine now, I guess I only need a smaller dose now after all the healing and therapy and stuff I've done. Everything with panic disorder at this point is pretty much fine besides extra anxiety during certain events like plane flights, of which I have benzos prescribed.



\--All of that was background, real questions start here--



So for pretty much my whole life, I've always performed bad in school. Bad grades, never motivated to study, procrastination, etc. As a kid, I remember taking some sort of ADHD test and being negative. My parents said that the explanation we got from the psychiatrist was that I didn't technically have ADHD, but I had anxiety and OCD that kind of presented like ADHD. My parents always wanted me to get on some sort of ADHD medication, but I always pushed back because I guess I thought it was like special help and I wanted to be able to perform without it like other kids could.



Fast forward to college, still having all of those issues, but after the whole panic attack thing, I had lots of really bad dissociation, depersonalization, derealization, etc. Over time it became less of dissociative episodes and not feeling real and more of just like a persistent fog where I never really feel present or cognitive like I used to before panic.



Over the past couple weeks, I've realized that I've probably been in denial about my productivity/focus issues. I've been doing bad enough in college and taking longer to graduate than I should and I cant keep doing that. I always just thought I was lazy or bad at getting stuff done, but after talking with a really close friend who DOES have diagnosed ADHD, and has been helped hugely by medication, I started realizing the things I've dealt with aren't really normal:



1): Motivation and making the right decisions. There are tons of times when I KNOW I should be doing homework, studying, etc, and I WANT to and PLAN to, but like, I just, can't. Like I literally can't make myself. Similarly, every new semester I always tell myself im gonna fix this and that or do things differently, but when It comes to actually making those changes, I just don't, and its not because i dont want to, its like theres a disconnect between me wanting and planning to and actually doing it.



2): Focus. I do have diagnosed OCD, and this is probably huge here. I feel like I can't stay focused on one thing, or when I can focus on 1 thing its NOT what I should be working n. I either get distracted by compulsions or by short term goals, or by thing that are easier or more fun. Getting distracted or wanting to do easier or more fun things as opposed to hard work can be something that anyone deals with, but for me it feels unrelated to how disciplined I am or how hard I try or care, and just how it is.



3): Brain fog and mental clarity. All the time, I feel some sort of dissociation or brain fog. It almost feels like my mind is ""out of focus"" like a camera or eyes would be, but like not optically, just how my mind feels. I feel like I'm in a fog all the time. I have a super visual mind and can imagine objects in scenarios well, but when I try to visually organize all the things I need to do and work, it just all fogs together in a mess. I feel like im not present or clear at all in my mind and it sucks.



Now, I always thought that with panic disorder, I couldnt take ADHD medications because the stimulation would just make me freak out right away, which is probably true with normal stimulants, but I recently decided to look into non simulating versions. From my understanding, the options are:



1). ATOMOXETINE (Strattera): Non stimulating, helps with motivation and focus. norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Improves executive functioning signal.



2). GUANFACINE (Intuniv): Alpha-2 agonist, originally a blood pressure medication, now FDA-approved for ADHD. Helps your brain differentiate between the main goal and distractions, reduces ""noisy"" neural firing, filters out distractions. Has a calming effect due to lower blood pressure so is almost the opposite of stimulating.



3). BUPROPION (Wellbutrin): This is actually something my psychiatrist recommended a year or two ago when I was dealing with binge eating issues. My understanding is that it also increases the executive functioning signal, directly improves motivation and energy. I've even heard it can feel like that brain fog is lifting off of you. Also understand that it helps initiate tasks and improve impulse control. This sounds AMAZING for my issues, but I also understand that it's mildly stimulating, which scared me cus I dont want to trigger panic. I suppose I could take a xanax ive been prescribed as needed if it starts to make me panic but still scares me. This is the one im most curious from yall about.



Anyways im just wondering for yall that either have ADHD or functioning issues ALONG with panic disorder, how did you deal with it, did u take any of these medication or others? How did it effect panic?",1763056393.0,panicdisorder

1ow5d7e,Please Read: Been in an episode for about a week.,"My panic attacks can sometimes last this long, but it is very rare and I am pretty much at a loss right now as to how to move forward.

I am traveling quite a bit for work and it has triggered me hardcore. Shakes, cold sweats, racing thoughts. I have no appetite. I throw up every morning. I can sip tea, which is good. 

I am supposed to leave on a big international trip to Brazil tomorrow morning and all the dread and all of the panic is so intense that I have just been numbing myself like crazy. My therapist is working overtime trying to find a solution, diazepam suppositories, and anti-nausea medication.

I so badly just wanted to stop. I want it to go away. I just want some relief. The only thing that helps is Xanax. I could spend my days in a fog, but I’m going to run out. I can’t just take them every single day for an indefinite amount of time.

I don’t meet a lot of people that know what it’s like to have multi day panic. I get panic attacks usually once a year and traditionally they’re between 2 to 5 days. I can’t seem to snap out of this one because the trip is coming up. 

There is a scenario where I don’t go, but then there’s a shame associated with that and whether that would actually help my panic or not. 

I’ve been thinking about getting IV today since I’m still in the states. I’m worried that any medication is a stronger than the Xanax is just gonna make me dizzy. Nothing is helping me with my racing thoughts and my shaking and my nausea. 

Of course, the natural doom and gloom is to go to me being fired, ending up on disability, losing my house, being homeless, dying. I can’t pull back right now. I’ve been in this position before and read other peoples positions and I’ve always been wanting to help them. 

Focus on the step, not the staircase.

Please please give me any words to encouragement or help. I am cold and I am sick.

1ovh39h,I smoked weed once and triggered panic attacks,"
I used weed once and had a panic attack. I recovered the next day, but a few days later I had another one and this kept happening for about 6 months.

At first, I kept going to the ER thinking something was wrong with my heart. I did several ECGs, blood tests, even a 24-hour Holter monitor but all results came back normal.

When I get a panic attack, I usually feel pain in the lower left side of my chest, numbness in my left arm, jaw, and back. Sometimes it changes like my hands or back go numb instead. The panic always seems to come out of nowhere, building up in waves.

My psychiatrist prescribed me Secita 5mg (an antidepressant). It seemed to help at first, but near the end of the treatment the panic attacks got worse again. It honestly didn’t feel like it helped much, so I don’t really want to take medication anymore.

Also, years ago I had a similar experience panic attacks that lasted for a month or two but that time it wasn’t triggered by weed and wasn’t as intense as this one. They eventually went away on their own back then.

Now I’m stuck wondering should I go back to a cardiologist just to be sure? Or is this all just panic-related? I’m not sure what to do anymore.

At this point, I can’t even do functional workouts or live my life actively like I used to. I’m a developer and I can’t do my work properly because of constant brain fog. I can’t remember basic things, can’t focus… It’s really starting to take over everything.

1ov5ms3,"thought i was finally getting better, but it seems otherwise","Hey everyone,
I’ve been doing better for a while — I stayed home for about a week and had no panic attacks or that horrible faint/vertigo feeling. I really thought I was finally over it.

But today I went to uni for the first time in a week, and it all came back. The dizzy/fainty panic feeling hit me the moment I sat in class. I had to leave and go home because I felt like I’d pass out.

Now I just feel hopeless, like why does this only happen when I’m outside? Is this normal? Does it ever actually go away?

I’m taking my meds regularly but this setback really crushed me.
Would love to hear from anyone who’s been through this and how you managed to push through.

Thank you..

1ov4egt,Chronically fast resting heart rate and pots like symptoms?,"Has anyone experienced this? There’s a chance I could have pots, but it’s never been this bad.

Doctor doesn’t know what’s going on.
I had an echocardiogram in July 2024 that came clear. Ecg’s are somewhat normal.

My pots symptoms were somewhat manageable up until recently after I randomly got a bad insomnia, the racing heart now stops me from sleeping. It doesn’t stop, it’s constantly fast. And now it rules my day because it’s affecting my sleep. I don’t sleep. 

I don’t know what’s causing what.
It doesn’t seem to be pots because my heart rate is constantly high 100+ at rest, it used to be around 60-70 sitting down only 3 months ago. Tossing or turning around in bed shoots my heart rate to 140, extreme palpitations. This isn’t my normal.

I’ve been to the emergency room many times these past 3 months. There’s no much they can do. They ran every test, and have nothing to say other than POTS. 

I stopped taking beta blockers too, because it makes everything way worse. My blood pressure got dangerously low on them, and they didn’t lower my heart rate.

Is this something any of you deal with in regards to the panic disorder? Could this sensitivity and high heart be a lingering effect after a horrific panic/insomnia flare?",1762952195.0,panicdisorder
1ouraav,(28F) Experiencing daily panic attacks,"Trigger warning for SA 

Hi everyone, 

Not sure if I’m looking for advice or venting or what. 

I am currently trying to go back to work after having five years off for medical reasons. This new job I have is amazing, it’s what I’ve studied for, the team are lovely and I do genuinely enjoy the job. 

However, after my first week (which went so well with no anxiety) I had to take some time off for a family funeral. During this family funeral I was forced to interact with a family member who attacked and assaulted me as a child and raped me as a teenager. It has been ten years since I’ve had to see him and in those ten years I’ve done a lot of work on myself to get to the point I am now. I was no longer having panic attacks, nightmares or intimacy issues.

This has all been changed since the funeral. 
I am now experiencing daily panic attacks, mostly surrounding leaving my house and going to my new job. I’ve managed to speak to my manager and she is being incredibly understanding about everything but I am still so new and I’m worried this will have lasting impact on my employment there. 

I’m feeling so out of control of my emotions right now which in itself feeds my anxiety. All my usually strategies aren’t working and my support system is worried. I have made a drs appt to seek professional help but I’m just a bit lost in this moment I think. ",1762909273.0,panicdisorder
1ouoc82,TMS for panic & depression?,"Hello, 

My psychiatrist had just approved me today for a referral to get transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS for short. Has anyone else tried TMS for panic & or depression? 

I guess for a tiny amount of context; I’ve gone through many SSRI’s and my psychiatrist is not all that confident that an SNRI will work for me due to the severe reactions I’ve had to medication. My gene site test shows that most of the medication’s are in the red section for me so it means I’m more at risk for adverse reactions to almost everything. They said they’ve never seen a genesite test like mine before. But it makes sense because I’ve had awful reactions to everything so far. 

I’ve heard and seen overwhelmingly positive results around this procedure (TMS). But I’m still scared because back in the day my great grandmother had electro shock therapy for postpartum depression and it changed her personality for the worse and then it made her life really hard because no one wanted to be around her.  It makes me sad for her. Now I know TMS is an entirely different procedure than electro shock therapy and it’s so much more less invasive, but I’m still scared.

A permanently nervous guy ",1762901738.0,panicdisorder

Does anyone have any specific panic attack triggers? Like certain places/things that you know you’re gonna go into an attack? Like going over bridges/into tunnels for example. Smoking weed is one of mine, haven’t done it in over a decade. 

For me going over bridges makes me feel like I’m about to enter Hell. Not only do I get attacks, they’re even worse with this. I don’t hyperventilate and get head pain on my other attacks like I do with bridges. Not sure if it’s heights or the water. I used to drive over them all the time, and one day it just happened out of nowhere. I tried a few more times with bridges but got the same result. My main fear was loosing control feeling like I’m gonna black out and that the head pain is from my blood pressure rising and I’ll have a stroke from it. I’m “ok” when someone else is driving but still I’m always waiting for it to happen. I have what I call bad anticipation anxiety when I know I have to travel certain places and all I’ll be doing is dreading counting the time down to when I have to leave and deal with a bridge. Btw I’m only talking about big bridges not small ones. Even with my eyes closed and headphones on with something playing I know we’re on it and I’m trying not to get into a panic attack, I can at times mentally prevent myself from getting one, but the fear is what do I do if it becomes a full blown attack? Cause once it gets to that I’m fucked until I’m away from what’s causing it. I’m almost more angry than scared cause this didn’t used to be my life.

After a decade of panic attacks I finally sought CBT for it, after a year with my therapist, they’ve evolved into … sadness attacks? Anyone else have this?

They used to always have a panic attack - or multiple - and then a deep sorrow that would usually break me down, and I’d have to find somewhere to cry, pull over while driving, etc. Now the panic attacks have become milder but the sadness starts instantly. 

TW: my panic attacks manifest from a deep fear of dying, I’ve gone through bouts of xenophobia, but have come out from it previously also with help of a therapist. I didn’t seek help specifically for the panic attacks until last year, and I didn’t realize how “bad” they were (for me) until my therapist had me log them, and I’d have upwards of 19 per week, and as few as 7, we discovered the patterns around when, where and how they happen, and I started to avoid situations at first, then confront them, and mitigate, and now I no longer have to use mitigation techniques and in an instant I’m devastated to tears. Still about anything death related, age, time, space, history, ancestry, heritage, existentialism, existential history, etc.

Recently I’ve moved to London from a small village to go to uni, I love this city, i’ve wanted to live here all my life and the first 2 months i THRIVED!! However midway through October I started getting sick (one of my huge triggers is throwing up, health anxiety convinces me I’m dying every time) I didn’t think much of it and put it down to being in a huge city and all sorts of germs were around. 

Over the last week I’ve been having crippling panic attacks, in one instance an ambulance was called for me because I blacked out and was inconsolable for about 2 hours. Now they are just coming out of the blue and are very very strong, lasting for hours, it feels like I’m going to die, like my head goes fuzzy, my hands legs and face all go numb, i hyperventilate, feel sick (the list goes on, any physical symptom you can think of i’ve probably felt it over the last few weeks) 

Yesterday was at its worst, I had a 3 hour long panic attack which resulted in me having to get off the tube and then I fainted on the platform, after having a full blown panic attack I was determined to finish my journey to get to my boyfriends house, I relaxed a bit and was watching a film (convinced it was over) and then it happened again out of nowhere, convinced i was going to die and i was having a stroke or i was going to have a seizure, this lasted about 30 minutes. I slept until 4am and then i woke up and it happened all over again until 6am. 

I am exhausted, drained, really really afraid.

Ever since then I have just felt off and my resting heart rate is higher than it usually would be. I haven’t been able to sleep for more than an hour or two because I feel like my nervous system just won’t calm down enough for me to be able to relax and during the day my skin feels like there’s electricity running through it, especially my arms? Also my left arm has been achey and sore. Idk I have really bad health anxiety, to the point where I went to the ER 25+ times from April 2024-December 2024. 
I also would like to make it known that I have had a lot of tests done to rule anything out. (Echocardiogram, holter monitor 3 times, endoscopy, EKGS, CT scans, blood work, rheumatology, tilt table test, etc) and those have all came back clear. I also can’t take propranolol. I do have flags in my blood work for possible auto immune issues bc my ANA and ESR are positive but other than that, I appear to be fairly healthy! I just wanted to add that in case anyone might think it could be any of the above issues lol. 

Anyone else ever experience a bad panic attack that leaves your body feeling like this for days/weeks afterward? I just want to sleep and be able kto relax but my brain has other plans for me I guess. I’m 29 years old and work a full time 9-5 job and have a kid to raise so this just isn’t working for me anymore and I am at a loss on what to do. ",1762259954.0,panicdisorder

1onsnml,Silent Panic Attack Relief,"Hi everyone,

I’m not new to panic attacks, but I am new to the “silent” part of panic, or at least what I’ve been made aware of. 

I’ve never struggled with too many physical symptoms of panic, except some finger tingling and shortness of breath. Having said, when my panic comes along, it attacks my mind like a wave that cannot be stopped. I feel like I’m honestly going to lose it and either go into psychosis or go “crazy” for lack of a better term. Now, this actually has never happened, and I only wish my brain believed it. But then I spend the remaining time after in fear it’s going to happen again, which it rarely does. While the panic is scary, it’s line the aftermath is worse. I spend almost every waking minute in fear and worrying about the next. I know that they can’t hurt me (the panic that is), I know they don’t last forever, but I cannot get my brain to believe this. 

Does anyone have any recommendations on how to combat this in way maybe I haven’t thought of?  I’m in therapy, I’m on an antidepressant (maybe I should look to change it), and I have clonazepam and propranolol in case of dire need (and I really hate having to rely on either of these). 

It’s a lonely feeling. It’s scary. Just looking for some support, if nothing else. Much love.

1omn80t,"My story about panic attacks, fear and autonomic disorder","Hi everyone.
I want to share my story about how panic attacks and autonomic disorder started, how it went and what I did.

The rules of this community do not allow talking about complete recovery, so I will simply say a fact - 11 years have passed and panic attacks have not returned.

Disclaimer:
Everything described is only my personal experience, my story.
I do not teach anyone how to do things “right” and I do not encourage anyone to repeat my methods.
The description of what I felt may seem a bit harsh, but I believe it is right to tell the true sensations I had at that time.


So.
Winter of 2014.
At that time my main hobby was photographing birds and animals.
In parks, in the wild - everywhere.
One weekend, as usual, I took my camera and went for a walk.
It was a really cold day, -27°C, so the walk was to the nearest park not far from home.
I was lucky - on leftover mountain-ash berries I found many birds, thrushes and waxwings.
The shooting fascinated me, I spent about 2 hours there until the batteries in the camera froze.
Of course, I was also frozen, but the mood was great, I was happy about a successful day, there were about 20 minutes of walking home, and I headed back.

And that’s where the thing started that then blew my mind for several months.
On the way I felt dizziness.
Pretty strong.
Later, calmly analyzing what happened, it became obvious to me that this was the result of emotional and physical exhaustion from impressions and long exposure to cold.
But then… then I really got scared.
I still didn’t know about panic attacks, autonomic disorders and all that.
My first reaction was strong fear that I damaged something in the cold, that I could lose consciousness right now and simply die in the snow.
The fear and panic were completely irrational.
I was walking through the city, around were people, cars, houses, shops, cafes - even if I actually collapsed, most likely someone would help me.
But fear and panic pierced through completely.
I remember biting my tongue until it bled to cause real pain and come to myself a little, and I almost ran home.
And panic only grew, thoughts were climbing into my head - “what if you froze vessels in your head and now a stroke will happen?”

When I reached home, at first it seemed everything returned to normal.
I warmed up, calmed down, ate and drank hot tea, marked this episode as strange and went to rest.
In the evening I sorted fresh photos as usual and enjoyed good shots.
Everything was normal.
Until… I needed to go outside again the next day.
The familiar fear and panic returned immediately after the door closed.
I was still going down the stairs, but everything already returned.
Outside it became even worse.
The whole set of symptoms fell like a snowball.
Dizziness, feeling of losing consciousness, the strongest fear to die right now from… from anything.
From a stroke, heart rupture, loss of consciousness and unlucky fall… it was absolute animal terror.

I had no idea what to do with it.
I had never faced something like this before.
Sports, trekking, long difficult workouts were normal for me.
And here… I simply could not do anything.
Fears and panic continued multiplying, I was already afraid even at home to make extra physical movement, strain myself with house chores - anything.
Relief came only from the position “freeze and do not strain.”
Then maybe nothing terrible will happen to you.

Of course, the quality of life and life in general radically changed.
I really wanted to solve this situation.
I somehow learned to cope with panic inside the house doing the most basic things.
But I needed to live. Work. Do all the usual things.
And it was a huge problem.
I temporarily solved the issue of moving outside by calling taxis.
I did not trust myself to drive in such a condition.
But to jump from home to taxi, get to work and quickly inside the building - it was hard, but possible. And so in everything.
The same way I went to doctors.
I spent a lot of money and time on examinations.
I was sure that on that walk, in the cold, I damaged something - I just needed to find what exactly.

I had MRI of everything possible done - all vessels, head, neck.
Endless ECGs and ultrasounds.
I asked the cardiologist to put full 24-hour monitoring on me (yes, by that time another fear appeared - fear of heart stopping in sleep).

Everything.
Absolutely all tests and analyses were within normal limits.

I also talked to a neurologist, the doctor cautiously suggested the real cause of my sensations, offered treatment options.
But… simple sedatives did not help at all.
And I still refused to try antidepressants.
I did not want to take strong medication, did not want to acknowledge the nature of my attacks and stubbornly tried to find a physical reason.

In this madness 3-4 months passed.
Despite all examinations everything only got worse, also in real life.
First, my girlfriend, with whom I had lived for several years, got tired of all this.
Now, reasoning reasonably, I do not blame anyone. There was really little left of the person I had been.
But then, of course, it was another blow.

Then I had to leave work.
After my autonomic system/psyche VERY convincingly imitated a heart attack at work.
It was unbelievable.
I literally lay on the desk and felt like dying.
I later googled the symptoms - EVERYTHING matched.
People around started to panic, ambulance came and… ECG showed NOTHING.

In several months the whole life collapsed, everything in it.
Relationship, work, hobbies, self-esteem.
Everything completely.
I was absolutely healthy physically, which tests confirmed, but I was in deep trouble.
I read internet forums and saw stories of people living like that for years.
The thought that I could spend the rest of my life in this panic and fear led to even more panic.

Starting antidepressants I still did not want.
In my mind that was not an option.
I did not want to tie my life to pills.
What did I want? To return myself.
The one I still remembered.

Reading different literature about panic attacks, neurosis and autonomic issues, I came across the phrase:
""There are no neuroses in war.""

For me it became the key.
I thought: what do I have to lose? Nothing anymore.
And I decided to start my own war with myself.
This phrase will sound pompous, but… I don’t know how else to call it.

I started by accepting that everything was happening in my head - here are physical tests, they show I’m healthy.
If my autonomic system could do this to me - it means I should find a way to roll it back.

I visualized, if you want, collected everything I learned about panic, fears - everything that hindered me.
Created in my mind a collective image of what I sincerely wanted to destroy to get my life back.
And then…

Next I combined two factors.
First - simpler.
“Accept the dark side of the Force, Luke.”
To the madness happening to me - I responded with even greater madness.
All desperation, all rage at what happened.
Here is my panic, my fear, everything that prevents living.
Here am I.
Only one will leave this cage.

And second… harder to explain.
I really stopped caring how it would end.
These are not loud words, not auto-training, not motivation.
I was simply tired of what was happening.
Tired of panic and fear.
Just didn’t care.
On a deep level.
I will cope.
Or let everything end.
If I lose - fine.
“The samurai is already dead.”

Hard to explain.
It was a state… of soul, maybe, that I reached then.
The last frontier.
Not because I wanted, or I am some“hero”, but because there were no other options for me.

And that's all.
I started.
Every day and every minute I poured rage on fear and panic.
Cold rage.
No shouting or slogans.
Scared to go outside?
Doesn’t matter.
Bad? Scary? “Dying”? Good. No problem.
So? What now? Why didn’t I “die”?
Where is my “heart attack”? Stand still, I still feel your remains, and I don’t accept it, I will not leave any part of you.

Feels like ""stroke"" will happen during exercise? Fine.
I will do squats until it “happens.”
How much do you need, Fear?
200 times? 300? 500?
I will squat until legs shut down from cramps but I will not give you a chance.



Since I am writing this post now, the result is obvious.
To my surprise everything ended quite fast.
Already in two weeks I walked outside with my camera, sat on a bicycle and rode through parks.
Sometimes panic and symptoms tried to return, but I already knew what to do with them.

Is that all? War over? Not exactly.

A burned emotional field remained, and depression came.
Seems like I should have celebrated. I got what I wanted, right?
But… emotional emptiness remained.
I don’t know - honestly don’t know - what part of personality was burned that way.
But depression came with thoughts - okay, you won.
And now what?
You are alone, your money is almost gone, no relationship and everything you HAD is still gone.

In such melancholic mood I spent another couple of weeks.

And then…
Then it was summer.
I sat on my mountain bike to refresh my mind from sad thoughts about what was already lost.
I rode far from the city.
Weather worsened, storm clouds gathered and I turned back.
Of course, heavy rain caught me halfway.
That didn’t improve the mood.
I decided to cut the route through a field road and discovered that trucks were taking wood from the nearby forest, and a good road turned into broken mud.
And then the emotional valve burst.
Heavy thoughts about what was lost in general, rain, and now this mud instead of road…
It would be reasonable to turn back a different way but… everything poured out of me.
I rode through the mud.
Seems I screamed, cried, cursed everything - and just rode forward without feeling anything.
Physically moved like a machine.
All emotions experienced in the last months poured out.

Then the field ended and the road ended.
I found myself at the edge of a small town on the way home.
Looked at myself, at my mountain bike.
We were both big chunks of mud.
Remembered where the nearest car wash was and tried to ride there.
Didn’t work.
Mud and clay clogged wheels, pedals, switches, chain so much that it was impossible to turn them.

Okay, put the bike on shoulder and walked to the car wash.
Washed myself, washed the bike.
Rode home.
The chain squeaked unpleasantly, I was all wet.
A railroad passed through that town.
Waiting for the train, I stopped at the crossing.
Sat on the bike frame, looked around tiredly.

My eyes stopped on a boy in a wheelchair.
Cars were also waiting for the train and he rolled to them and said something. I don’t know. Maybe tried to sell something, maybe asked for money.

The train passed long ago, cars left, I still sat and looked at one point.
One thought went in my head:
“You just plowed through a field of mud with your bike and didn’t even notice how you did it.
You are physically fully healthy.
That terrible panic does not bother you anymore.
Are you sure you have reasons to be unhappy with your life?”

That day a new, different person returned home.
I won’t say he was better than the previous one, but…
Life showed how quickly everything settled for this new guy.
In all areas of life.

Why did I write all this?
Yes, everything became good then.
But life is life, difficulties still happen and… every time solving them, I return in thoughts to that time and think - would the old me have handled it?
And unexpectedly… I do not regret that experience.

Recently I had a real physical trauma with the sciatic nerve, I wrote about it in the related subreddit (how I successfully dealt with it), and traditionally returned in my thoughts to those events.
Today I thought and decided to also write this old story about a problem that ruins life for many.

Maybe… right now somewhere sits a person with the same level of despair from panic and fears that I had then.
And just like me then, scrolls through the internet in related topics.

No, I will not tell you “do as I did.”
I will not wish anyone to dive into that emotional hell.
I just want to tell you - if it seems to you, like it seemed to me then, that this is hopeless and the end… maybe this is only the beginning of something much better.
Find your own path. For yourself.

My anxiety and getting into panic attacks when driving has gotten exponentially worse in the last handful of months. And we lost the only doggo we had left back in August. Also in the process of moving, and I’m constantly on edge cause we have to cross 2 bridges “one of them is close to 4 miles” and I have a history of severe panic attacks crossing big bridges.

It helps a lil “for like a few hours” then once the evening hits my anxiety hits its peak. My head feels all fuzzy, like literally I can feel it. It’s like being in a constant daze I can’t get out of.

1ol4t65,Are these panic attacks SO scary for you guys too?,"Last night, I had the worst kind of attack I know of. I wouldn’t hesitate saying that it feels like experiencing death in my whole body. 

Note: I have seen the doctor and gone to the ER multiple times with these exact symptoms and they send me home saying it’s anxiety.

I was hyperventilating and couldn’t breathe. And my chest felt blocked. So I isolated myself, laid in my bed and tears were streaming down my face. This is when I start choking up and I know it’s here. From my experience, fighting it doesn’t help so I let it take control so that it could get done and pass. 

I had these extreme palpitations. My chest was not just tightening but also tingling. And I felt like my diaphragm was hurting?? As if someone was scouring my guts out. I actually yelled in physical pain. I actually started crying loudly and yelling like “Ahh it’s hurting “ like a child. Then my body was going numb. My hands were almost immobilized. While my chest was exploding and my stomach/diaphragm area was hurting from feeling stretched and bashed. Next thing I know my mind is going numb and I’m wondering if this it. I’m gone. I’m leaving my body. But I didn’t. I never do. I laid immobilized for about 40 mins throughout this whole thing. And all of this all alone.

1okz5xq,Panic attacks due to changes in routine?,"I'm wondering if anyone has had similar experiences and could provide any insight and/or advice. I've been experiencing high anxiety for the past few months, and had my first panic attack a few months ago. It really caught me off guard because while I have dealt with anxiety for many years, it's been mostly under control. However, it has been a stressful year in general due to mental and physical health issues, and grief, so I don't know if that triggered anything.

I'm noticing a pattern with my panic attacks. They seem to come on AFTER any change in routine. For example, in July I went to a cottage with family for a week. This meant some changes to my eating, exercise, and sleeping routines. At the end of the week, I woke up in the middle of the night feeling panicky, with my heart racing. I don't recall having a nightmare that would lead to any panic or fear. I took some deep breaths, and lay down on my back with my legs elevated and the attack was over in a few minutes. I spoke to a doctor about this and based on my symptoms they said I was dealing with panic disorder. They said the night episode was a nocturnal panic attack and that they can seemingly come out of nowhere.

A week ago, I was away from home due to a family emergency- I just got back home this past Sunday. Again, changes to eating, exercise, and sleeping routines. On Monday, a day after coming home, I had another panic attack. I was drawing when I felt the same sensation of panic and rush of adrenaline with my heart racing. This panic attack felt like it came out of nowhere too. I used the same technique as I did with the nocturnal attack to help myself calm down.

Is it possible to have panic attacks due to changes in routine, or a build up of stress? This has been really hard for me because I love travelling, but since the attacks started, I've been worried about having panic attacks while travelling, and have been feeling like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop once I get back home. Again, if anyone has had any similar experiences, or if you would share what has helped you, it'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.",1761927957.0,panicdisorder

I've been bedridden mostly since July, after a string of intense painc attacks landed me in the ER 90+ times, destroyed my sleep and gut, and zapped me of all energy.

1oielq9,Panic attack during public speaking,"Hey guys - need some advice and frankly encouragement from the folks who really get it. 

Just off a work call where I was asked to present something for a few minutes. I master the topic, the project is something I care about deeply, lovely host, super chill audience. It does not get any safer than this. 

Within 1 min of talking I got the good old panic attack. With my voice shaking and crumbling I finished abruptly with the last semi coherent sentence I was able to utter.

For background, I have a history of complex trauma, and I’ve struggled with anxiety, depression and OCD my whole life. I have random panic attacks maybe a few times per year, always in public speaking. I’m also really passionate about what I do, and I absolutely refuse to opt out of a successful career simply because I was born and raised in a profoundly unfit environment.

1oidqkg,Getting ADA for my panic attacks,"Hello everyone, I'm going through an issue with my company. Recently, they announced they'd end all WFH days. And... this was kinda my only thing that gives me a sense of security at the moment, as everything in my life is kind of already unstable.

We used to have 2 days WFH, but because of my panic disorder diagnosis, I talked to my manager, and she gave me an additional day. And this has been very helpful; it may sound like nothing, but it gave me a sense of comfort knowing I don't have to worry as much about another panic attack on the bus, in my cubicle, or in the middle of a meeting, or in a place I cannot escape.

When I heard the announcement that we're going back into the office full-time yesterday, I got really nervous, and later last night, I had a very bad panic attack, my worst one in a long time. I don't know if it's directly related to the announcement, but I felt like I'd died, I couldn't breathe, and by the end of it, I was sobbing. I cried all night, and today, I'm so ""paralyzed"", I couldn't even move or get out of bed.

I know it doesn't sound like a big deal, but upon hearing the news, I felt very helpless. I know there are a lof of things in life you cannot control. But I'm already dealing with a lot of things I can't control: I'm an international student on a work visa, so my entire life here depends on my job, there's no family or close relatives here with me, and I just feel there's nothing I can do to help myself feel better and no one to help me. Still, I searched online everywhere and saw that perhaps it might be possible to request an ADA accommodation for my panic disorder.

Overall, I'm just very anxious about making these kinds of requests. I'd just started therapy about 6 months ago, and so I still have a lot of doubts about my mental health conditions. I was diagnosed with panic disorder, my therapist says I have panic disorder based on the incidents I tell her, but I'm just not sure if I really have it or I'm just overreacting. And even when I brought it up to my manager the first time to ask for that additional WFH day, she asked me if I was sure I had a panic attack or was just being anxious.

I'm also working here on a work visa, so I feel like they would not take my request seriously and might retaliate by firing me. I'm just overall scared of asking, but I feel like if I don't ask, I fear I wouldn't be able to get it out of my head and might have another panic attack. It's just a lot of mixed feelings and overthinking. I have all the documents necessary to make the request, but still, I'm just afraid they won't believe me, and I have to further ""prove"" my panic disorder.

If anyone's going through the same process of requesting ADA accommodation, I can really use your advice.

1ohebel,New here. New to panic,"I am so relieved that I have found this community. I am 34 years old and my first panic attacks happened back in 2023 and I have never had issues before. I've never suffered from mental health problems. I don't honestly know where this stuff has come from, but here I am now having severe debilitating panic. It is exactly how everybody here has described it. It's random, it's unexpected, it is completely debilitating, it's put me in the ER, shoots my blood pressure through the roof. It is purely physiological. I've been through counseling, I've been through mental health therapies. I even took six weeks out of intensive care to work on this and I feel like few people really understand, especially so far in my experience in the medical community, they seem to treat it more as a mental health disorder than a physiological health disorder and every time I get into counseling and every time I get into therapies to work on this, I am quickly moved to the other end and pushed out of the therapy because I'm not struggling with major stresses in my life. I'm not struggling with depression in my life and there are people that have mental health disorders that are more serious than what I've got. However, that doesn't stop the panic, the sheer terror, the impending doom and death that looms over me when I have the panic attack. I am on medication for the first time in my life and I am a wreck with all of this. I am terrified that I'm going to continue to have panic the rest of my life. I'm terrified that it's going to continue to take me away from my family and my kids and my wife. I'm terrified that I'm going to be driving with my children, taking them to the zoo and I'm going to have a panic moment and I'm not going to be able to be there for my kids and instead I'm going to have to pray that my seven-year-old can take care of me and I am just struggling so much with trying to adapt my life to this new way. I am on medication right now. I am on an SSRI. I don't have anything for breakthroughs which I happen to be going through right now. I am trying to get back in with a counselor and trying to get more serious about having a regular psychiatrist to help me manage my medications but this whole world is new to me and I just am concerned that I am not doing the right things. 

I've spent so much time trying to talk about this issue with other people that seem confused, and this community is the first time I see people who really understand where it's this strange thing where I don't feel like I've got a mental health problem. I have, or at least, I don't think I've got a problem where the panic comes from mental stress. It's mental stress that's coming from the fear of panic, and so I don't know where this panic is coming from, and so far the SSRI definitely does help, and I'm thinking at this point I need to go up in my SSRI dosage, but I just, I don't know because this is such a strange thing where it's taking me years to figure out what's going on. I have a problem with me to figure out why I've got this, and what the triggers are, and where things occur, and so far, as best I can tell, I have issues with eating, well, it's all based around either eating or cardio.

I panic if I eat too much, I panic if I eat too little, I seem to panic if I'm having abdominal distress, or the abdominal stress comes from the panic. I'm not sure. I'm having a breakthrough right now, and I think it's a result of heavy drinking over the weekend and a small puking spell, but I think I got from some food poisoning. And so now, all of a sudden, my gut is just a complete wreck this weekend, and I am having my first breakthroughs in several months, and that's one thing I haven't been able to figure out. Is there something wrong with my stomach, my gut? How do I manage gut problems with this? 

At 33 years of age, I realized that, uh, some of the cardio issues that I'm having, and I don't mean issues as an, oh, I'm bad at cardio. I was a very athletic individual. I was a gymnast, and I did a lot of running, and so, that kind of stuff wasn't a big deal to me, but I do remember way, way back in, in school. I did have some minor panic episodes. I didn't know what they were at the time, but I did have some minor panic episodes all around breathwork, breathing. And that would start to make me feel lightheaded, which then the panic would ensue, and that still exists in me today. However, very recently, I have come to the conclusion that if I subconsciously am struggling to manage my breathwork, then I need to consciously figure it out. And for those of you out there that are also struggling with breathwork, I would highly recommend you look into stuff, things like the Wim Hof techniques and other breathing techniques from Tibetan monks and stuff like that, because it has definitely helped me a lot. If my breathing starts to fall out of control, I have been able to somewhat regain it, or at least at a bare minimum, relax my mental burden by simply saying, I am in control of it right now, and as long as I stay with my breath counts, then everything is going to be perfectly fine. I'm not breathing too much. I'm not breathing too little, and everything is going to be fine, and that helps tremendously. So if you're having breathwork issues, I really, really recommend you look into some techniques, or there are even apps out there that will help you with breath timing. Please, please look into it.

I've dealt with panic attacks and OCD since I was in 3rd grade. Of course I didn't know what they were back then, and neither did any of my teachers or family. My anxiety is generally at its worst around my health. 

I wasn't officially diagnosed until my freshman year of college. That was about 18 years ago now. Since then, it has been a constant battle of trying to find the right medication to help me live as normal of a life as possible. 

A couple of months ago, I switched up my medication regimen of 20mg lexapro, 75mg effexor, 2mg Klonopin, and 100mg propranolol throughout the day. I wanted to try Wellbutrin due to its impact on depression, so my psych doctor said let's drop the effexor and try the Wellbutrin.

The Wellbutrin did work well for my depression, but I felt my anxiety getting worse and worse. This really came to a head about a week ago and I've been living in hell ever since. A week of severe panic attacks, muscle tightness in my arms and shoulders, losing weight, upset stomach, etc. 

Tuesday I felt like I was losing my mind and called an ambulance. Any pain or sensation I felt I went to the worst case scenario in my mind, and I continue to do so. I was checked out at the hospital and all tests came back normal. 

Tomorrow will be day 7 of being off Wellbutrin and day 5 of restarting the effexor. My psych has said I can use up to 3mg of klonipin during this time, but I feel like a failure doing this.

I am very happy to say that I am almost 1 year free from panic attacks. The longest I went before this was 6 months, I had an attack in Nov last year and it was so severe that it felt like I was back to where I was a while back. Everytime I had an attack or a little wave of panic it just caused a depressive spell. I was diagnosed with depression quite young and put on medication at 18 but the panic was just a completely different beast. I have said several times that I would have rather felt that severe depression vs panic. It truly is a confusing disorder to live with an also explain to others. I felt like I had to warn people everytime I went out or did something even slightly new. What I have learnt over the years however is that the people who truly love and care for you will be there no matter what, as long as you are trying your best. There will be strains with friendships but listen to how theyre feeling and dont just shut them out. My counsellor also told me ""why do you think that you will always have panic disorder"". I had never thought about it and I just assumed it would always be there but no, its not. And I am so incredibly happy every single day because of how far I have come.

For a while there, I did get a little better and feel normal. But towards the end of 2023, and to now, I've gotten slightly worse every month.

1odht2g,Little trick I use for irrational fears 🧠,"I wanted to share with you a little habit that I adopted recently during my panic attacks or moments of great anxiety, which allows me to rationalize and calm down more quickly. 

Little background story first : Personally, my panic attacks are mostly accompanied by two symptoms that still frighten me after decades of experience with panic attacks: a tight throat and the feeling of air hunger. These symptoms are intrinsically linked to two irrational fears that I have: having an asthma attack or going into anaphylactic shock (a severe allergy), two things that have never happened to me in 34 years of life...

So, recently, I started telling myself the following statements when i start spiraling: 
👉🏻""I have never had an asthma attack, but I have had many panic attacks!""
👉🏻""I have never had anaphylactic shock, but I have had many panic attacks!"", etc.

1od5kyk,What do you do when you have fear of going crazy?,"Heyy everyone. So i have been diagnosed with panic disorder and im on lexapro. Im also currently not doing anything at all. Meaning i stay home but i do have a job and ill start working this 17th of November 2025. Also to add on, im going to see a clinical psychologist this weekend so i hope it will be helpful. Long story short, does anyone have the fear of going crazy? I just recently started this fear and its distressing as hell. Some days i feel okay and some days im not. But i started going back to the gym lately and it has only been a week. So far so good but today i just happen to have this fear (again). Sometimes i worry that i start to hear things, sometimes im just worried that ill simply go crazy (like lose touch with reality). The thing with me is that, the fear of going crazy is the one that made me had panic attack last week and my doctor has increased my dose now. 

Its so tiring to feel this way. Part of me feels that once i start working, it will go away since ill be occupied with things and i have no time for all these negative thoughts. Either way, if any of you have experienced this, care to gimme some tips or advice on how you deal with this. Thank youuu.",1761132285.0,panicdisorder
1ocxwjw,Blood Work Fear,"I used to have no problem getting blood work done and even preferred watching the process. But since developing panic disorder and a strong fear of fainting, I’ve started panicking before and during blood draws. Some of my panic symptoms are feeling dizzy, DPDR, and feeling faint, but I’ve never actually fainted or lost consciousness. The fear of losing control triggers intense anxiety. I am due for my annual physical and attempted to have the usual blood work done, but I had a severe panic attack and couldn’t go through with it. My psychiatrist suggested taking Xanax beforehand, but when I tried it on an empty stomach, it didn’t really help because I couldn’t stop thinking about the blood work. I’m looking for advice on how to manage this so I can get it done.

1obuzmm,Unable to sleep out of home,"Hello everyone, I’m 20M and currently dealing with a terrible cycle of agoraphobia and panic syndrome. Since I was young, I have always avoided sleeping out at friend’s houses or school trips that involved an overnight stay. Through my early teenage years, 16-18 I managed to eventually travel with my girlfriend’s family and once or twice with friends, however, most of these times, during the first night, I experienced nausea, shaking, insomnia, sweating, and other panic-like symptoms. From this last year onwards, these symptoms have intensified and I even had to cancel a summer course that I would do abroad one day prior to the actual flight. 
I have been doing therapy and taking meds (pristiq 100mg) for the last 8 months but I still have extreme fear of staying out for the night. I have recently visited another doctor who prescribed me with Paxil as he said that I have, indeed, panic syndrome and not regular anxiety disorder. I feel so exhausted and guilty for all of this. Guilty for not being able to live exciting moments and socializing like other people my age. Things have been getting so bad that I had to turn down an invite from a date to sleep at her house even though, I obviously wanted to, but my panic was so intense that I came up with a shitty excuse and headed home. I just have no idea what to do anymore and am so scared that eventually I won’t even be able to leave my house. ",1760997088.0,panicdisorder
1obqz58,Screaming during panic attacks,"Hi guys,
I haven't really heard anyone else talking about this, but ive had it since my panic attacks started, and was wondering if anyone also experiences this?
My most severe panic attacks are always the exact same, my heart feels like it stops, I cant breathe, my entire body starts burning, I physically jump forward, all of the usual stuff.

However, whenever I get these severe ones, I also scream, like, blood curling screaming for 10 minutes straight. I dont know if its 10 minutes, but it goes on until someone comes help me. My throat dies from the guttural screaming and its always followed by at least 10 minutes of sobbing and hyperventilating. I dont know why, I never go straight to hyperventilating, I always scream first.

Even in less severe panic attacks, it always starts off by me yelping or screaming once. Im absolutely horrified of the thought of having those panic attacks. Sometimes I feel nothing but guilt for my neighbours and family who wake up in the middle of the night to someone screaming bloody murder.

Anyways, yes, TLDR: I was wondering if anyone else screams when they have panic attacks? It's absurd, I dont scream consciously, it just comes out, and it won't stop. Im so sick of it! 

I feel like i post a lot, but to be fair, ive got 11 years worth of things to ask without having someone to ask till recently.",1760988067.0,panicdisorder

1oasvy9,It Feels Like a Failing Moment,"I think I've been diagnosed with my panic disorder for over 10 years, and after multiple scenery changes and household moves, I started having less symptoms. Yet from the title of this, obviously, things happen. 

I don't know if I did this last October but I've previously realized that October is a weird time for my brain I guess. I don't know if its (I don't wanna disclose major family business) events that seem to fall in the month, I don't know if its seasonal- yet can't refer to any other part of this season to be remarkable in what comes around- no clue. 

Now I was, WAS in therapy until I think 2 years ago- every week, consistent, on time. Insurance is a funny thing and the company had no paid their end to the therapy office and by the time the office found a solution the due time to swap and keep services didn't overlap and a lot of folks lost their appointments and therapists altogether. I was one of them.

However, I was coming to a turning point with a different environment and life that when I'd first began. No longer was I stuck in a mentally abusive situation, and career choice was keeping me busy to the point it was healthier. So therapy honestly started to feel just like a habit and not something that was continue to proactively educate me. Now I will never be healed, but I was even noticing up front, I think losing that was maybe something I needed. Just- to try and see what happens when I let myself be the more raw version of this more adult person I'd not let figure the world out for herself.

And to touch on meds? I had ""take as needed"" .5 mg of Ativan scribed. And I broke them suckers in half. And they'd make me too calm like snap your fingers in my face and yell FIRE and I had just the blanke stare. So I didn't like how my tolerance or lack of, responded. So when I let therapy go, meds went too- and honestly? A couple hits off a Garlic Breath indica strain settled me and helped me feel more normal than anything else. And I literally mean 2-3 and I was normal.

So why say all this? Because for a week now, I'm deciphering between am I dying or is it me again acting up. And its the second one, (don't feel like it but it always is right?). Its being at work and now I gotta sit in the back and doom scroll and sip water so I don't scare the customers trying to shop. Telling coworkers hey I'm doing weird mental things and it'll pass but I need a minute. Chest tight, breathing manually, and feeling now embarrassed that nothing has changed in the last year or so that SHOULD make me feel this way and yet? Here we are in the month of October and its defeating of a feeling. 


And came back the match three games, the water sips, counting 4 to inhale- 6 to exhale in yiur nose out of your mouth, ALL the little things we all learn to try and ground ourselves. And it'll pass. And I'll be home, fine, cool as a cucumber (I havent smoked a joint since last year either which I rarely did anyway), and its a day off where I'm choosing to chill and I wake up with the breathing all shallow and familiar warning signs and I'm so made at my head cause now its interfering when NOTHING IS HAPPENING! People keep asking- what is it, whats the trigger, and I'm feeling like an idiot because logically theres always a delayed something or another with me and I can, not, figure, it out. So I keep getting more stressed of WHAT IS IT! WHATS THE FOUNDATION?! 

After two, TWO years of not having this response randomly, its not being a part of my regimen again and I have zero indication how to make it stop. Which then because I am ""comfortable"" in this which is ironic- cause its just my personal being weird and I know it'll pass- I ride it out. I talk about it and ride it out. And feel insane after but better when it finally goes away!

I'm so tired of this.

I've had GAD, hypochondria, depression and panic disorder for over 12 years now, with things coming and going in waves through good and bad periods - with the worst leading to the ER and suicidal thoughts. I've tried a bunch of medications, I exercise, eat well, have good friends around me, go to therapy every 2 weeks, etc.

After a good period of a couple months, I had an anxious/panic relapse about 2 months ago. This led me to my doctor trying me out on Buspirone (as one of the few anxiety medications I've not tried).

The first month on 15mg went quite well, I felt some side effects the first hour after taking the pills, but didn't really have anything resembling a panic attack or daily anxiety for that first month.

About two weeks ago I upped my dose to 20mg a day. The side effects (flutteryness, anxiety, dizziness, wild dreams) were a bit stronger but still subsided after an hour or so. However, now after 2 weeks on this higher dose, I've had a really bad past 3 days.  
  
It started with a night of 4 hour sleep, and my first real panic attack again in a long time the following day. The day after that I just felt so exhausted and down. Yesterday, I felt on edge all day - with derealisation, blurry vision, forgetfulness, feeling dumb and constantly on the edge of a panic attack. The same today. I'm also worried that I'm going to go crazy, worrying whether I'm seeing subtle hallucinations out the corner of my eye of bugs etc., forgetting how to play some songs on the piano.

I'm just so sick of this. I want to be able to be happy. I'm tired of watching the world from behind a blurry window. I'm tired of constantly feeling like I'm about to have a panic attack. Or constantly scanning for sensations of an impending panic attack. I just want to forget about the way I feel and get in with enjoying life.

I've tried a bunch of different medications, therapy, healthy lifestyle, but it just seems to be a part of me.

I know the fact I was good for months just a a couple months ago means it will happen again with time, but I just want to be there now.

Does anyone have any things they could suggest which could help? Tools, techniques etc.? I'm lowering my dose down to 15mg again incase this is a reaction to that. But of course my anxious mind is telling me there could be something seriously wrong - a brain tumour, that I'm about to snap and turn schizophrenic.

My heart rate immediately race to maybe about 170 bpm. It came down a little bit after the initial spike but it stayed around 130-140. I had someone drive me to the hospital where they did and EKG and bloodwork. All was completely perfect but the whole time, my heart rate would slow down to around 110 and then speed up to 140. I would get hot flashes and taste metal in the back of my throat. My legs were very weak and my head was spinning.

For 8 days straight now I've been having a rolling panic attack. Started completely out of the blue while i was playing with my son for absolutely no reason. 

I've had them before, but not for a long time now. And once I found out what was happening to me I was able to pull myself out of them very quickly, then they just stopped completely. I was also told at this time that they were made worse and repeated more often than for most people because of my ADHD. 

I've had multiple panic attacks every single day for 8 days now. Even between attacks it feels like my breathing has switched to manual mode and that I'm on the verge of another one at any given time. 

I've not been able to go into work since this started, and I work in a job where I'm on commission with no sick pay. During this time, I've probably eaten a total of 4 meals as well. I'm not getting to sleep till 3/4AM every day.

I've self referred for Therapy. But they won't be calling me until the 22nd of this month for an initial assessment. After that, there'll be a bit of a wait until I actually get therapy.

No other mental health team will speak to me without a referral from my GP. 

I've also been to A&E (ER) when it got really bad in the first couple of days. I was seen by 2 lovely mental health team members who basically aren't allowed to do anything other than give advice. They've told me they think I need some short term medication on prescription to tide me over until therapy starts, but they're not allowed to prescribe anything. 

I went back to my GP, who's prescribed me 10mg tablets of Propranolol that I can take 3 times a day. He told me to ""play about with the dose"" up to 40mg 3x per day. This has helped slightly, it's reduced the intensity and duration of the panic attacks, but I'm still having them, and they're still bad.

I phoned the GP back today to tell him the Propranolol didn't seem to be working. He's now prescribed me a course of anti depressants which will take 4 weeks to start working and up to 8 weeks to start working fully. Planning to keep me on them for 6 months. According to him there's no other option for me. 

At this point I genuinely just want to be chucked into hospital and be put under for a few days and wait for this to all be okay again. Obviously not an option, just how I feel!

1o5x1tx,finally booked doctors appointment,"i have had health anxiety for a little over a year now and before this i haven’t been to the doctor and was fine without going and now since my health anxiety is here ive been terrified to get anything checked or even go to the doctor. i’m terrified they’ll find something and im terrified if i don’t go ill have something i would have had the chance to catch early ya know? sucks i know. but last week i took my bf to the er and which we thought was a str*ke and we had to stay over night ran lots of tests and the on our last day there they didn’t suspect anything bad, thank god i was freaking out so bad especially with how bad my health anxiety is to be surrounded by people who actually have what im terrified of ever having. we found out he has high cholesterol and needs to start making changes to his eating habits and starts getting active. since find out that out it definitely made me realize that could be me as well and i need to start making changes and i have! but also i finally made an appointment for a doctor appointment to get checked out all day ive been thinking about calling them and i finally did and made an appointment for next week on Friday im very surprised on how quick i got an appointment which is better so im not just here waiting months and letting the anxiety build just waiting for an appointment. 

but anyways is there anything you guys wish you could have asked on your first appointment to the doctor since your health anxiety started? i don’t wanna sound crazy and dump all these symptoms on them. is there any specific tests i should have done? idk any advice helps i could already feel my anxiety build up for that appointment ",1760391357.0,panicdisorder
1o5wfmy,Every time I think its getting better it isn't,"I know it does get better i just have gone so long without a break now it feels like its endless. My previous episode started around April/May and ended in September. Then four weeks later another one started, panic attacks every day. And at the moment I can usually go one or two days without needing my emergency medication, but on the days I dont I still have panic attacks. I'm just scared that if I take my prescribed benzos too often they won't work, and I really really need them to work. The only relief for my panic attacks is the idea that if a pill will make them stop, then clearly this panic isn't permanent. It's hard to believe that when the panic never stops.
Sometimes I remember the times when I wasn't having panic attacks were usually times when I was going through other struggles.

1o5g5s4,Looking for reassurance,"I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder earlier this year when my health anxiety spiralled after being diagnosed with Hashimotos Hypothyroidism. 

Annoyingly anxiety is a huge symptom of Hypothyroid so I tried my best to deal with it by managing the condition, but the anxiety only got worse. I started getting random spikes of heart rates >140bpm and the feeling of my heart leaping around. Adrenaline would fill my stomach and my entire body would tremor. My head felt like it would explode with fear. I would experience this multiple times a day for weeks until I realised what was happening. Then it would happen daily, then for a couple days then nothing for a week until now when I experience probably 1 a month (but not for long or as severe).

I’ve been in therapy since March. My GP gave me Propanalol for the panic attacks (which do actually help). I’ve been working out. Gave up breastfeeding so I could sleep better. My diet is awful as I’ve suffered so long with nausea I just eat what I can when I can. I am now seeing a nutritionist for gut dysbiosis which has helped so much. 

The problem I’m having is I have made HUGE progress and I recognise what is fact and what is fiction, BUT, every time I have a wobble, mentally it sets me back what feels like weeks? I get so angry at myself and diminish all of the work I’ve put in to myself these past 7 months. It feels so counter productive that I can’t just say “ok, today is not great but let’s move on”.

I’m hoping some likeminded people can reassure me on a few things perhaps by giving some advice on how they managed the following;

1. Feelings of anger/hatred towards yourself
2. Anyone experience high levels of depression after anxiety?
3. Is in increasing SSRI dose common at this stage?
4. Advice on getting calories in when your body rejects it

Any advice welcome, no matter how basic or trivial. I feel so isolated dealing with this invisible illness. My body is so tired trying to cope with this, it’s exhausting. ",1760351707.0,panicdisorder

I’m 12 weeks pregnant today, I was just starting to feel a little bit less sick and getting my appetite back this last week, however I sometimes suffer from panic disorder. It usually happens with big events, social expectations, I put pressure on myself because I want to feel okay for it and end up making myself sick.

It was my birthday yesterday, I had friends and family coming round to see me, and subconsciously I must put pressure on myself because I want to feel okay for people coming, and worry that I don’t want to panic, and then this ends up in me panicking. I had a mini panic attack, and ever since I had been horrendously sick, back to how I felt weeks ago. I have thrown up so much, I can’t eat a thing, I tried some toast last night and threw it all up immediately.

What can I do to feel better and get back to how I was feeling? Also how can I nip this in the bud and stop these panics, it controls my life at times. I have ruined many Christmas days getting like this. I take medication for it, I tried therapy, not CBT though. What about Hypnotherapy?

I was diagnosed with Bi-Polar Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Manic Depression as a young adult. I still have frequent manic episodes and I’m always nervous and anxious about things. It doesn’t matter what either. I just always feel “on edge”. I could be at home, sitting on my couch with my wife and boom.. my anxiety starts to spike? For no apparent reason whatsoever. My therapist tells me it has a lot to do with unresolved past trauma and I feel as if that might be true because I can’t put my finger on why I’m always feeling so uneasy all the time. My chest feels heavy, my head feels light, my hearing is induced, my mouth is dry, I feel shaken and stirred, I’m always hot and need cold, I crave sweets but don’t eat them because I don’t want to gain weight, etc.

I have been suffering from Panic Disorder though since late winter this year. I never used to have them. Maybe an anxiety attack here and there but never a panic attack. They just started coming out of left field. I would have 2-3 a day for months. It was exhausting and I know my wife is getting sick of dealing with it. I can see it on her face. She feels helpless towards my panic and does not understand why I’m always getting so worked up. It’s hard on her. She loves me. But I’m trying my best to overcome this. Anyways, I’m almost 2 months nicotine free and I’m proud of myself. I think smoking was a massive cause to my anxiety spikes. I also quit caffeine a couple months back. Heavy caffeine, that is. 200mg+ a day I was doing for years. Quit, cold turkey. And I also stopped drinking alcohol. I was a heavy wine/whiskey drinker for years and just stopped. So I am doing better but my panic is still there. I can still sense it. It’s so strange. I’m overwhelmed..

I am genuinely happy in life now? I do not understand why this is happening to me anymore. I can’t seem to put a finger on it. I just can’t. Any thoughts? Oh, and I’ve also been on a few different medication’s. Zoloft, Lexapro and Buspirone. None of them worked for me to be honest. I also tried Xanax, 1 time, and it made my heart race like crazy.

I had panic attacks before that but I was abusing weed so much I didn’t even care about them, just kept smoking and they went away. 

I have came a long way, from 8-10 hour episodes breaking down and freaking out about my symptoms to very controlled short attacks. The lingering symptoms are the worst part though, hard to get a job when I’m scared about panicking. Going out with friends? Maybe drinking on my 21st? Worried and don’t want to. What if I panic? 

Anyways, I was hanging out with some friends yesterday and one of them brought up that they have never seen me have a panic attack but heard about them from another friend. I said as a joke “I bet he called me a pussy for having them, didn’t he?”. I was not expecting a yes from that, but I got it. 

A friend that I’ve known for 10 years, calling me a pussy for having an illness I can’t control. Multiple people have done that. Saying I’m overreacting and that they aren’t that bad. Telling me I need to get a job and stop worrying so much. Telling me that I need to lose weight because I’m getting heavy. I understand all of it, but it feels impossible.

I can’t work out much because I hate the feeling of my heart pounding and the shortness of breath that comes with it. It’s terrifying. I can’t get a job because I’ve had such bad experiences ever since my diagnosis. I don’t know what to do, I’ve gone through therapists and medications over and over and nothing has helped.

Still, I feel like if I don’t take it, I won’t accomplish much, sure, I’d have normal orgasms, but I wouldn’t meet people or really live.

I’ve had a really bad case of insomnia that’s lasted almost a week — barely 5 hours of sleep in total during that awful week of severe insomnia . I kept getting rolling panic attacks and my heart just won’t stop racing since the beginning of all this, constantly sitting over 115 bpm at rest and getting up to 160-170 during stress. It’s still so high now, and I can’t sleep because it feels impossible to relax with my heart pounding like this. Every night is a battle.

I’ve had a full heart work-up and blood tests nothing major came up. A few strange things on the ECG, but some ecg’s came back normal, some came back with inverted t waves and st changes which the doctors had no clue about. My echocardiogram last year was completely normal, thyroid fine, iron slightly low, and all my minerals are within range.
I was given propanalol and it doesn’t work, beta blockers seem to cause a lot of rebound issues.

Can anxiety or panic disorder really do this? Can it keep your heart rate elevated for over a month straight, even when you’re not anxious? I just want some relief.

1nz1ebo,Can a panic attack last over a day?,"Last night, or rather the night before, I had my second of what I can only assume was a panic attack. The first was a bit over a year ago. Both times were eerily similar. I was chillin at home at about 2am, totally fine, and actually in a pretty good mood. Then, in 5 seconds, BAM. My legs were on fire, it was restless legs times a hundred. I was trembling, in cold sweats, and tingling. I kept switching between burning and freezing. I had what I can only describe as ""extreme discomfort"" so bad I was squirming on the ground. I even puked, and shit my pants just a limittle bit. But strangely enough, I also felt tired, and was even yawning a lot, and LAUGHED few times. It lasted all through the night, no sleep. Throughout the day, while it wasn't AS bad as before, it was very much alive. It was an excruciating day. I was able to sleep a few times, once for an hour and once for a few. And each time I felt a bit better after, but still suffering. Even my shit looked and smelled very strange. It wasn't until this morning that I was mostly normal, and about now at 5pm that I feel completely normal. I prayed to god after the first time that l'd never go through that again, but here I am in the aftermath of that. I could bear that for an hour, maybe a few. But over a day was unlike anything I ever experienced. I used to be convinced it wasn't a panic attack. It was too physiological, like an actual sickness. But the more I look into it, the more I see a panic attack is the only thing that fits. But still, can it really last over a day?
Like 32 hours? And for that to happen TWICE now?
Does this sound like what your panic attacks are like, and have they ever lasted this long.

Edit: I also wanna know ab y’all’s experience with meds, tho obviously my psychiatrist will help. I’m sure some benzo would work if it happened again, but to be honest I don’t want to have benzos in my possession.

I’ve been in the worst places imaginable when a panic attack strikes and I feel like I’m going to die of a heart attack or stop breathing while my face goes numb and I think I’m having a stroke. I just found this podcast/last minute HELP ME scream out (I’m aware these episodes are a few years old) 

Most of 90% of stuff I’ve listened or watched on YouTube or from any mental health professionals get me *through* the panic attack but never over the hump. I feel jittery, exhausted & even like “hmm maybe this hasn’t completely left my body yet” but what I loved about this lady is that she focused on a lot of the normal grounding things and breath but also more importantly HOW TO handle the aftermath, and from spiraling into a dark place while feeling very lonely, I feel super comfortable in my skin and can carry on this evening while getting some things done (on my own terms) and not being shameful about what happened to me.

1nxptnm,Guanfacine experiences?,"Hi, earlier this year I had a depressive episode and lot of stress, anxiety. I slept bad and I had a panic attack I guess(woke up in the night, sweating, chest pressure etc) and I feel since that im in a state of hyperarousal/fight or flight, I never truly feel calm fully and its like my body is on the edge most of the time/signaling alarm, hence my sleep is also fragmented.

Ive started paxil since, am on 20mg for a month now, and while it got a bit better, the volume seems to be lower but still not „off“. Ive read about guanfacine as it activates alpha2 receptors which dampen stress/nophrenphine response in the brain, this would in theory reduce sympathetic activity and make me feel more calming/safe. I asked my psych about it, she said its an option to add, but I should stay another 4 weeks on the paxil first to have full 8 weeks on it.

I was wondering if anyone has experience with guanfacine/a similar case? Ive read mixed things, some reported they got out of this fight or flight feeling which makes me hopeful. thanks",1759571443.0,panicdisorder
1nxn04r,"Panic Attack sent me to the ER, now I feel funky","Hello. I’ve had panic attacks before. Short and sweet usually, usually caused by some big emotion. Today however, I thought I was dying out of nowhere. My heart rate kept fluctuating and my nerves kept sending bad signals in my body it felt like. Pins and needles sensation kept going through my limbs and up my neck into my head. I had this panic attack for over 4 hours. The ER said all my tests came back good and that they were almost positive it was a panic attack. I calmed down and got home, feeling just dizzy. Now I’m awake after 2 hours of sleep and my brain BURNS. Google says it’s a normal anxiety response, especially after so much exhaustion. However it’s scaring me and probably setting me up for another attack. Can someone please verify if that’s actually the case, and I should be fine to go back to sleep?

1nvq229,made my bubble so small that i no longer get panic attacks,"before you say “you don’t have panic disorder” i’ve been diagnosed and suffered for ten years with it. it rules my life and has ruined it. but i havent had one in months. my attacks are situational , and because i don’t see people or get into situations where it’s possible anymore , they’ve stopped. i’m unemployed, with no hobbies or anything to do all day besides walk my dog and watch movies with my parents. you might say that doesn’t sound too bad but i’m in my twenties. all my “friends” are building their careers and dating and moving forward in life..

what makes me feel insane is that i can actually do a lot. i just have to be alone /with “safe” family members. I grocery shop alone i workout alone i drive, i get coffee, but it’s all painfully lonely. I don’t have social anxiety but my panic disorder shows up in social situations because i’m not in control. i have a phobia that makes me panic snd sometimes faint if i even hear certain words.(haemaphohia) Because this has happened so many times my brain equates socialising and being far from home with danger. Anyways- i’m just wondering if anyone else is in the same boat. I’ve only ever heard people say their panic disorder is “random” and they either still have lives or it stops them doing anything at all, like leaving the house. I know i’m privileged in that i can - but it can be its own torture. it’s like still being in prison but with a VR headset of what could be.  I’m sick of doing the same things alone and not being able to do things like take a class or meet a friend for coffee.

1nvnywv,Panic Attacks as soon as I Eat?,"Hi, so this situation is a little strange and I’m not sure where to go. I’m kind of worried. This is a kind of vent/seeking advice kind of post I guess. 

So, I’ve always had stomach issues, my stomach is very sensitive and I can feel very nauseous after eating/drinking anything, even if it’s healthy. Recently it randomly got worse, so I became scared of eating again and started eating less. I don’t want to eat at all, but obviously I have to, otherwise my body gets weak and I experience terrible side effects.

 But every time I try to eat a meal, like something more than literally a single piece of lettuce, I’ve gotten panic attacks, or panic-like symptoms? Instantly out now where, while eating. This is just making me even more scared of eating and I’m terribly confused as to why this always happens! Why does this happen? I become strange and dissociate/hyper aware anytime I eat even a small meal and my heart starts racing? I’ve already lost a lot of weight and it’s probably damaging my body a whole lot. I’m afraid of eating but I can’t bring myself to do it because I get forced into a panic attack by my stupid body who can’t handle anything. Why does this happen?

I've had 24/7 stress and panic attack morning to night, it was unbearable and too much for my mind and body. Eventually the compression feeling on the lower back of my head and symptoms of stress response all faded, but then came new symptoms, brain fog, cluster headaches, etc. As time went by so did the progress of the symptoms, eventually experienced pain all over my body, and as these symptoms progress, Ive been losing some functions such as not knowing if im hungry or if i overexercised, unbearable brain fog, etc. These days everyday my arms and legs hurt so much, my head hurts so much (neuronal/electric sharp pinches), and as these symptoms keep progress more things are being affected. So basically it feels like I'm going through a kind of neuro and physiological decline, I don't have the feeling of stress response, but don't know if its still there. I've had brain scans and bloodwork, everything ok. The only thing thats worked was neuromodulating options like neurofeedback but symptoms come back after minutes. I don't know what to do.

1nuu204,"Felt the need to say this, hope it helps others as well.","I, M 32, have been having anxiety issues for most of my adult life, and for a long time, maybe the first handful years, from 18 to about 24, I denied its existence. Not effectively, I would find myself incapable of doing things normal people would do like go to classes in college or do overly social things, but I didn't speak to anyone about it, friends or family. Felt saying it aloud would only serve to make it real. That was a massive mistake, and I would recommend no one go down that path, it almost led to my own demise. 

What snapped me out of it was my mother getting diagnosed with breast cancer. It didn't fix anything perssay, but it gave me a different view on life. Gave me a purpose, even if it was temporary, which was to help and take care of her. She struggled for years, for a bit it looked like she might beat it, but ultimately, it metastasized into her bones, making her weaker and into her brain/spinal fluid, making her terminal. The combination of disease, surgeries and chemo/radiation therapy left her unable to walk or do most things for herself but she wanted to spend as much times with her grandkids (my brothers children, my niece and nephew),  so she fought and she was able to turn a 6 month prognosis into 2 years of which i took care of her.

That purpose was the only thing keeping me together, and I needed her to be as comfortable as possible. I like to think that I did what I did for her, others have even gone as far as to call me a hero everything i did for her (I was a full caretaker, 24-7, fed her, gave her baths, changed her diaper, took her to almost every doctor's appointment, surgeries, chemo, radiation, kept up with all of her medications which were allot and im sure there was more i can't think of right now) but I never felt that way, I felt failed her in every single way because I couldn't stop the tidal wave that was coming to take her away. I know that isn't true, but the brain works in weird ways and im trying my best to understand that.

When she passed, it took me a bit to process everything, the end was horrendous and is something that will haunt me until the ends of my days. Hell it was years ago now but im not sure how much progress ive made on that front, but almost immediately me and my family came to a sort of pain bond, where we all knew each other's pain and only wanted to help. Then my stepsister from my father's side moved in and ruined everything, but that story is for another day. The reason I bring it up is because my entire family, brother and his kids and father were living together when she passed but my step sister started series of events that would cause my father to sell the house making everyone move out. This was maybe a year after my mother passed, my step sister made sure to not move in until she passed because my mother always knew she was bad news (She was 100 percent right).  

After that storm, my brother and I moved into a house together, and my father got himself a much smaller house not to far from us. For a long time, I was so occupied with life and loss that the feelings of anxiety and panic for myself that I dealt with before almost disappeared, I find that if im doing things for others, I can pull out this otherworldly will that i can never seem to muster for myself. 

Well recently, maybe a year ago, it started coming back. Anxiety, panic attacks sending me to the hospital, vomiting for days on end, the episodes get dark. I get past them and become ""myself"" again but my will power was waning, still is. But this time, I made a change and finally went to the doctor, she gave my hydroxyzine for now while they run tests and said we will revisit this with the results inhand to rule out potential external factors. While its only the beginning of everything and I dont truly know where this road leads, for the first time in a long time, I feel a bit hopeful, like I'm finally doing something right. If you are struggling, please talk to your doctor, friends and family, don't just let the panic attacks erode your will like waves onto rock because eventually you'll find yourself sinking into the sands left over. People care and are willing to help you, you matter, you are loved, you will make it. Thanks for reading this long post.

1nsy2t4,How to not fear scary symptoms??,"**SORRY IF THIS IS WRITTEN POORLY, EXHAUSTED AFTER AN EPISODE AND NOT FULLY RELAXED YET 🙏🙏

I have pretty severe issues 😭😭😭

I basically developed constant dpdr from this disorder, but along with that, when I’m attacks are really bad they take at least 2 hours to go away.

During these big attacks it always starts with a weird feeling of uncertainty. I wouldn’t even call it impending doom, but maybe it is. Just something feels off, but it’s a feeling I can’t describe.

Then after a few minutes I’ll eventually get some weird symptom like my vision is “zooming out.” Very difficult to explain since it’s not quite that.. (not tunnel vision either.) 

It triggers a weird out of body expierence then I feel faint? I never actually get dizzy but I feel very much floaty. I feel like I’ll pass out at any point, which thankfully I never have, but god it gets bad. In the store I was in hell, I dropped my drink because my fingers felt like they didn’t work. It wasn’t even paralysis, all I know is that it didn’t feel like my hand and I couldn’t control it. Like my hand just didn’t work???

My legs started feeling like jelly. The derealization was intense cuz everything felt like it’d fade in an instant; then things started feeling like something bad was really about to happen which intensifies everything.

The tremors started and then eseclates to my arm trembling against my will, getting tingly, and THROBBING. Like my heart was racing in my arm.

I felt like passing out, I felt like I was trying to balance on a balance beam, and without fail my right eye ALWAYS squints up during these moments which has always made me paranoid cause I’ve never heard this happening to anyone else. So I look like I got a lemon squeezed in my eye the entire time.

And it’s like my own brain has the shakes too. It’s so scary and nobody understands. I’ll cry. Beg to go to the hospital. And I’ll get ignored because I have to “put up with it,” to get better.

And unrelated to my medication, I also get such heavy eyelids during the attack and after. Which makes me more anxious because it’s like I am fighting to stay awake, so now it adds another problem because at that point if I give in and sleep while having the attack, I’m gonna die. This isn’t what I mean when I referred to feeling like passing out earlier either, it’s a seperate issue. I feel like this one isn’t a true sleep, rather fatigue that will lead to me losing consciousness and likely dying. 

And I am currently off of Zoloft, I only did a few days a few weeks ago because it turned up my anxiety to insane levels and I was basically begging everyday to be sent to a mental hospital and GENIUNELY couldn’t cope with the side effects and lost a lot of weight that made the doctor concerned. 

But I do take hydroxozine and I did in fact take it
right when the weird feeling first started to simmer but my medication low key doesn’t work on severe attacks. When it’s these major ones, it usually falls flat and I gotta wait it out. I am feeling a bit better and I did NOTHING but lie in bed😭😭 It’s been an hour and I still am out of it, in the sense that I can’t really process that I’m alive right now since everything seems fake. 💔 so heavy on the dpdr..

I just wanna know how do you not think ur gonna die during these moments. I can have it time and time again and I’m still gonna believe this is gonna be “the one.” I think it’s because it’s SO consistent and has specific symptoms it makes me fear I have a brain issue that’s going unnoticed. 

I have been checked 3 times (cause I went to the hospital 3 times within weeks of each other )

and they’ve done bloodwork and other tests on me and I’m always medically cleared YET I’ve never been given an mri which is what I’ve wanted the most because I know deep down I fear I really do have some brain disease 💔💔💔

It’s just hard to accept or understand my anxiety can be so debilitating or scary. It truly feels like death is approaching.

1nshbt1,Panic attack recovery - 6 months later and where I’m at now!,"Hi everybody! I wanted to share my story because I was desperately searching this sub when I was at my worst. Here’s my story:

I’ve always struggled with anxiety and the occasional panic attack. Maybe once every few years, but always moved on from them after they happened. Never thought twice about it. In December of 2024 I was sick with a bad cold and woke up to have the worst panic attack of my life. This in combination with being ill caused me to pass out, throw up, all the symptoms. It was horrendous. From then on I developed and was diagnosed with panic disorder. That one bad panic attack sent me into a completely overwhelmed state for months. I couldn’t leave my house, I dropped out of my first semester of senior year of college, quit my job. I thought I was broken forever. I truly could not imagine being “normal” again. I even stopped driving for a period of time. I finally decided I needed help and that it was not something I could just get over. I started seeing my therapist weekly instead of biweekly, started working on exposures (which was not something I was doing before as I never had any sort of panic attack fears), and the BIG one which I know is a hard pill to swallow (literally) was medication. I started Zoloft in February and worked my way up to a comfortable dose which I have leveled out at now. Things were extremely hard for about 4 months, but now I’m back at school in person, driving, working, going on trips, going to crowded places like restaurants, etc. In the time I started my medication I’ve only had 2 panic attacks which have not been as debilitating as the others. I truly thought healing was not possible. But it is. Mental health IS a personal responsibility. Try the medication, even if you don’t want to. Do the exposures even if it feels impossible. And most importantly, BELIEVE you will get better. This is not to say you won’t ever struggle after recovery. There are still small things I have to work up the courage to do to get fully comfortable with. For example, driving on the freeway by myself, and being alone when my husband goes out of town for work occasionally (especially sleeping without my husband). However, these are things that I know I can overcome because I have the right tools, and I’ve overcome very hard things that I felt were impossible when I was at my worst. Even if you try over and over and you feel like you’re failing, keep going. And take the damn meds! They are truly what will give you the ability to use your tools so you can actually heal.

1nroj4h,Does the panic ever end,"It feels like pushing thru hell

I have been on sertraline 100mg before i cut it down to 75mg on sep 4th 
I thought it was a decent taper amount 
Sep 22nd sleep was so messed up and the panic was creeping in so i had to go back up to previous dose 100mg 
Since sep22 i havent had proper restful sleep even with alprazolam 0.5mg i get 3 hours of continuous sleep and then its just broken light sleep (take it only on absolute panic nights) and 20mg inderall plus tried 360mg elemental magnesium glycinate.
Sleep was fragmented before but atleast in bw i felt like i slept
These past few days ive not been able to even tell if i slept.. its like im unconscious and then i wake up thinking some really random thoughts and im super tired the entire day. And these spells happen for an hour sometimes 30 mins.

My question is 
How long till sertraline stabilises or i see some relief?
Is there something that can help meanwhile?
I dont want to use alp daily.

1nrm8ch,Nocturnal panic attack,Ive been diagnosed with panic disorder for years. It comes and goes. I can be fine for a year before the next episode. I had a particularly rough 2025 with mental health. I finally gave into the idea of medication. Was put on prozac and gave that a try for 6 weeks until i just couldn’t do it anymore. Now on lexapro. Just woke up to a gnarly panic attack. I usually get nocturnal panic attacks. The one good thing about prozac is even though i would panic it was easy to rationalize. Im 4 days into lexapro and i just dont think i can do it. Had to take an ativan and now im just praying for this feeling to go away. ,1758947880.0,panicdisorder

Often I usually take half of the .5, .25 and it helps. Last night I wasn’t helping even after waiting. For me the Xanax kicks in as almost exactly 35 minutes. I had a panic attack for nearly 4 hours. I think I honestly ended up taking 4 mg of Xanax. I saw online some people take 5-10 mg in extreme cases so I wasn’t worried about overdose. But I have ever ever taken more than 2 mg. Even with that I am still anxious a bit the next day. I maybe only take Xanax once a month so it can’t be from overuse….. has anyone had this? 


Edit: I think the panic attack was brought on because I missed my dose of Cymbalta the night before. Apparently that can cause bad anxiety. But still weird the Xanax didn’t work ",1758915819.0,panicdisorder

1nq80w4,Cardio without panic!🤸‍♀️,"I wanted to share with you a small victory in my life recently. I have been living with panic disorder with agoraphobia since 2023 (my 2nd time in 34 years of life). My anxiety symptoms are very linked to sensations with my heart and lungs. I am always afraid of being out of breath, of running out of air, of my heart beating fast, etc. At the beginning of my panic disorder, I had so much cardiophobia that I didn't dare do anything that could increase my heart rate (coffee, sugar, fat, large meals, climbing stairs, lifting heavy things, sex, etc.). However, ironically, before that I was a very active person! I did HIIT workouts 5 to 6 times a week. But as soon as my panic disorder started, it was as if all of a sudden I felt like I was made of crystal, like a was ultra fragile. 

Anyway, yesterday I was finishing yet another cardio workout at home when I suddenly realized what I had just done. A CARDIO workout! Driving my heart to 180bpm and leaving me breathless! And yet, I wasn't anxious or afraid! Yes, I had physical sensations that could have sent me spiraling into anxiety and panic, but these sensations were buried under endorphins, pride, the feeling of regaining control, etc. 

I wanted to share it with you because people often point out to me how much I stop myself from being proud of my healing journey. And I think I'm probably not the only one here who has trouble celebrating the small victories accomplished in order to get better. I would be lying if I said that, overnight, I went from being cardiophobic to being able to train in gym classes and do cardio at home. I went through several difficult and scary steps to get there. But it is possible and it is valid to have to relearn how to do certain things that, for the majority of the population, seem ""normal"". We all experience our own personal challenges and difficulties, and we all deserve to be able to celebrate our small victories when they occur. ❤️ ",1758809924.0,panicdisorder
1nq0d69,2 weeks panic attack free,"Hi everyone!

Almost 3 months ago I had what I believed to be a heart attack, ended up in ER because of severe chest pain that radiated to left arm and jaw, SOB, loss of feeling in extremities (I’m an EMT so Ik all the signs and symptoms and was 100% convinced I was having a cardiac event)

Since then I’ve probably had about 50 of these events, every ER visit, had been normal, every EKG, blood test, echocardiogram, stress test, and holter monitor all normal

I was given Zoloft to take and have been taking it for the past month, my panic attacks seem to have kinda stopped which is good but all the Zoloft side effects are killing me 😭

However in all of this I’ve noticed the past 4-5 days my resting heart rate has dropped significantly, and my standing / walking hr has dropped, like my RHR went from 80-90 to like 60-70, and my standing hr was usually 90-115 and now it can be anywhere from 65-100, still very normal ranges however it’s just strange that it’s dropped, is this just me being paranoid or is this a normal reaction to the panic attacks stopping and my body calming down a little bit

1np9snb,PD from GLP-1,"Hi all, This a little long so i’m sorry

so I’m one of the good chunk of people who have developed a pretty severe panic disorder due to GLP-1 injections (at least I think) I didn’t think it was the case until I found a separate group of people on fb having the same identical issues. Some only taking a few shots, and some being on it for a year (8 months for me) 

I have zero history of anxiety and all of a sudden on 8/21 it felt like I kept needing to take a deep breath, so I went to the drs and she put me on lexapro, and said it’ll most likely get worse before it actually kicks in. Let me tell you, I only took it for 3 days because it threw me into a psychosis which lasted almost a week. 

But ever since then I’ve been getting severe panic attacks for no reason and Sucidal idiation, which I’ve also never had in my life snd im not sure where the thoughts are even coming from. I’m now filled with adrenaline all day and night. I’m on propranolol which i felt like only helped for a day or two and kolonapin, which i was only taking once a week (when i would take i would be fine for days.) But now it only seems to help for the day, I’m still not wanting to take it often even though my dr said he would be okay with daily (I’m not) 

I keep spiraling down this hole of “what if this is forever” I’m barely getting any sleep due to these adrenaline surges. I’ve gone to the hospital 4 times now for all different reasons and each time they said it was anxiety. One of them I was actually relaxing and then I became extremely light headed and my blood pressure shot up to “hypertension crisis” so of course I freaked out. 

Thankfully, many people in the GLP-1 anxiety group said it eventually does clear up for them as their body heals from no longer being on the shot. But the recovery times for everybody are all over the place.

1noexzp,First flight in 12 years,"Hi all,

I just wanted to share a recent small victory / recovery moment.

Until last week, I hadn’t flown in 12 years. On that flight 12 years ago, I remembered having such a horrendous panic attack that I swore I’d never fly again - surely no holiday could possibly be worth that living hell?

Flying hung over me as my absolute worst fear for the past decade. I missed out on great memories with family and friends, as well as some really awesome work and study opportunities.

A few months ago, I decided enough was enough - I was determined to prove to myself that I didn’t have to live like this. Drawing on my years of therapy (including a lot of exposure work), I booked myself in for a 2 hour flight to Spain.

It wasn’t comfortable - I panicked a lot, especially during takeoff and bits of turbulence. But it also wasn’t anywhere near as bad as I had expected. As I have discovered time and time again with this disorder, the thoughts / fear surrounding the experience were so, so much worse than the reality of doing it.

I’ve now booked myself in for 2 more flights in the next 6 months. I’m looking forward to making up for lost time and making another big step forward in telling panic disorder / agoraphobia to go f*ck itself and living a life free of unnecessary fear.

Wishing everyone reading this strength in your own journeys - I am finally starting to believe this thing can be (mostly) beaten ✈️",1758627351.0,panicdisorder

1nnnmcp,Struggling moving out @29,"I’m 29, and I just signed a lease with a friend. On paper, it’s a good move — affordable, close to work, a chance at independence. But the reality? I feel crushed.

I used to live away from home in college and was fine. I even enjoyed the rhythm of being on my own but coming home on weekends, eventually only coming home occasionally on breaks and whatnot. Then Covid happened. I moved back home at 24 and stayed. Over time, I got used to the comfort of my mom being in the next room and my dog sleeping nearby. They became my daily anchors.

Now, the finality of moving out at this age feels unbearable. I keep panicking at the thought that “we’ll never live together again” — that it’s the end of an era, not just a new beginning. Even though I’m only moving 20 minutes away, it feels like a huge emotional loss.

I know people will say “you’re supposed to move out by now,” but it’s not that simple. My anxiety (recently diagnosed as severe panic disorder) makes change feel like an earthquake. I don’t want to feel like a failure for struggling with something so many people treat as normal.

I guess I just needed to put this out there. Has anyone else felt this way — like the finality of moving out later in life hit harder than the first time? How did you cope?",1758550436.0,panicdisorder
1nnn5y7,What’s wrong with me,"Hii everyone, I’d love to have an outside perspective on my situation since I haven’t been able to talk to anyone who really understands yet.

I’m 20F and I’ve had health anxiety since I was a child, some years were worse, some years better. When I was around 15, I spent a whole year convinced I had leukemia and no doctor could convince me otherwise. Eventually that passed, but I started developing more OCD-like symptoms. I’d always have a specific fear in my mind and would feel like I had to do little rituals to prevent it from coming true, which i still have to this day but it’s much more manageable.

I’ve been to therapy mutliple times, but after a few months I usually started feeling “normal” again and felt like i have no reason to be there, so I’d stop.

Last year I went through a breakup and spiraled a bit. I started binge drinking socially, got myself into a few unsafe situations, and ended up in a depressive episode for a few months. Eventually I got better. For about half a year I was doing really well, drinking less, doing well at school and work, and feeling less anxious overall (though I was isolating myself a bit out of fear of losing control again).

This summer I went to Japan for a short uni program with my friend. It was my first time so far away from home and my parents, but I was really happy and excited. The first night I was fine, but when we went to sleep, I became super aware of my heartbeat. The more I focused on it, the faster it got, until I panicked and thought I was having a medical emergency. We called an ambulance, but they said I was okay.

I’ve had panic attacks before, but always for a specific reason, this one felt like it came completely out of nowhere, although I do think it’s because I was in a new situation, 10 thousand kilometers away from home and tried to ignore the anxiety this caused me. I was also jetlagged and I severely lacked sleep. Because of this episode I became more aware of my body and started monitoring myself which made me really anxious, and a few days later it happened again. This time also with shortness of breath, dizziness, and chest pain. I was also taking hormonal pills to delay my period at the time, and I thought they could’ve also contributed to this so I stopped taking them. Things calmed down for a bit, and when I got home, I tried to move on.

But then it happened again, when I was at home and in a calm environment, not stressed at all. I told my parents and insisted on going to the ER because I was convinced something was physically wrong. They did a bunch of tests (EKG, blood work, IV fluids) and told me everything looked fine. I followed up with my doctor and asked about seeing a cardiologist, but she said it wasn’t necessary and that it was definitely just stress.

Since then, the cycle keeps repeating. I’ll feel fine for weeks, then I’ll notice a symptom (like feeling a little short of breath), which makes me spiral, and then I end up having another episode. At first it was just heart palpitations. Now it can be shakiness, dizziness, shortness of breath, hot flashes, and a general sense of panic, thinking I’m going to die. The worst of it usually only lasts a few minutes, but the anxiety from it can linger all day. I’ve developed a big fear of being alone especially at night, I’m scared I’ll have a medical emergency and nobody will know until it’s too late.

I’m starting therapy again and maybe considering medication based on what the’ll tell me. But I still can’t shake the feeling that something is wrong with me physically, even though all my tests were clear. What scares me mostly is that there is never a specific trigger other than noticing physical symptoms. Recently I got a message that triggered me and caused me to really panic and it almost felt better than these episodes, because I knew i at least have a valid reason to panic and i don’t have to worry that I’ll die. I also don’t know whether to classify the epiosdes as panic attacks, the panic attacks I’ve had in the past were a long time ago and always due to a clear specific trigger but I remember them feeling different than this.

Sorry if this is too long, I didn’t want to leave anything out. Has anyone experienced something similar? I’ll appreciate any insight or help. Thank you :)

1nnh14e,Life sucks guys,"Two years ago my life completely changed. One night I was perfectly healthy and normal, and the next day i started getting panic attacks out of nowhere. That one day caused me to be in a cycle of around 30 panic attacks per day for about a month. Going from one er to the next within a singular week, all tests come back normal “you’re not going to die your heart is fine your lungs are fine” and you’re just convinced that you will die, and no one believes you. At some point during that month I genuinely believed that I have died and now im in hell and this is my punishment or something. After two months of trying to deal with whats happening, I wasnt eating (I lost around 70 pounds within a span of 5-6 months in that year alone) due to not eating (dont know how I didnt die)I happen to be an international student so I took a 26 hr trip back home hoping that my heart doesnt stop mid way to my country because I could not handle being alone and going through this. I ‘felt’ better surrounded by friends and family, went to a GI specialist, went to a cardiologist, and finally went to a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with panic disorder and GAD and prescribed xanax and propranolol and sulpiride. This all sucks because it changed my life forever, I used to be someone who wouldnt fear shit, and now I feel fear like nothing else. I used to be a big introvert, now im extremely extroverted just so that I could be surrounded by people in order to be distracted enough to not feel the constant pain in my chest. I used to be a gym ‘bro’ and now the thought of going to the gym sends me into a spiral because ‘what if my heart stops what if i faint what if i trigger a panic attack’. See no one understands how this feels unless they were experiencing it, and I wouldnt wish this upon anyone… especially that it started out of NOWHERE. Imagine where one day you were fine and the next your whole life completely changed OUT OF NOWHERE AND FOR NO REASON. 

This started on March 22nd 2023, and now its almost going to be 3 years. I survive off of Xanax daily (not exactly addicted as when I was in my home country I went without it for two months as I was distracted day after day) but when im alone, its really bad. My woman is on the phone with me 24/7, she watches me sleep because “baby could you make sure Im actually breathing while sleeping?” She doesnt mind, shes a godsend who I will forever love. But it doesnt feel the same as being around people physically. I have friends where I study, tons of them, but I dont feel the security of being back home. I am a senior I graduate next semester, but I wanted to be a doctor and now i feel like i could never be. For years now, I tried searching for causes (not as much solutions) because I was confused? How did this start? What triggered it? I mean I used to have depression as a teenager but dont most teenagers go thru that? 

To end this vent session, I will admit, I am better than when all of this started as I do go out, I do go to my classes (even if I have to take my pills with me everywhere I go) it does get a little better; I talked to my psychiatrist and i told him that from what I know disorders dont go away, and he said that panic disorder is actually one of the disorders that do go away, and two years are a short time for recovery.. it just takes alot of effort, alot of rationalizations, and faith that hey I WILL get better.

1nmqiqq,always out of breath,"i got diagnosed about 3 years ago and had over 30 panic attacks. i’ve managed and lived with it, but the thing i struggle with the most is the sudden random shortness of breath. i can be a little tired or out of the blue and suddenly feel my chest tighten, like it’s harder to breathe than usual. or sometimes its the sudden increase in heartbeat like my heart is gonna jump out of my chest. there’s no specific reason, it just happens out of nowhere. has anyone else experienced this?

edit:
i’ve realized maybe it’s a kind of “mini” version of panic attacks, but it happens so often, maybe daily, to the point it’s more exhausting than the big ones. the only thing that works is taking a break for hours, or i can take my meds (diazepam 2 mg and alprazolam 0.5), but i feel like they shouldn’t be taken daily, so i don’t know how to cope.

Now im having adrenaline dumps and need to poop, burping like a crazy person, and typing this to calm myself down. Its so tiring being inside my brain, I hate it. Does this happen to anyone else?

1nm95es,Nocternal panic help,"TLDR: What helped your nocternal panic attacks? If you ever dealt with jolting awake in panic, what made your symptoms better and do you have any advice? (besides medication- I don't want to take it personally but not I'm shaming anyone who does.)

To give a little background, I have dealt with panic disorder intermittently since I was a teenager, going through periods of severe anxiety and constant panic attacks, these periods lasting a several months at a time but usually never more than a year. The rest of the time I still have anxiety and the occasional panic attack, but not to the point that it affected my life much.

The current ""episode"" started 2 years ago and is the worst I have ever experienced. In the weeks leading up to it, I could feel myself becoming highly sensitized and my nervous system was getting seriously out of wack like it never had before. I had that ""something big is about to happen"" feeling. On the night it finally boiled over, I had a major panic attack that caused me to develop neural circuit dizziness PPPD. I started to feel like my body was swaying constantly and the feeling never went away to this day. In the following year I struggled with agoraphobia because being away from home made the feeling worse. That first year I only got much worse. I was so afraid of my symotoms because they were so hard to bear, my body was like a clenched fist 24/7 in anticipation of the next attack. During this time I was consuming a lot of content about panic disorder and pppd, trying very hard to follow advice and heal myself, which only made it a lot worse.

I also developed very frustrating problems at night: my body was absolutely terrified of going to sleep. Every single night, the very second I start to drift, I would feel  an explosion of panic in my chest and jolt awake gasping. I would do this at least 15-20 times a night. Then sometimes I would have one so bad that I would wake up already screaming and jumping out of bed, sometimes landing on the floor from being tangled in my blanket, sometimes already to my bedroom door before I would fully wake up and realize that I was okay.

This past year I made a lot of progress. I slowely desensitized myself to things I was deathly afraid of, like going into grocery stores, and I mostly just tried to ignore my symptoms instead of focussing so much on them, which helped a lot. I had to just let it run its course and eventually without any real effort on my part (besides forcing myself to go places I didn't want to go) my body eventually realized that it was safe. I feel like I can go anywhere and I'm not spending everyday in fear of when the next panic attack will come, I've had maybe 2 in the past 6 months. The swaying feeling is still constant, but I've learned to live with it. It doesn't ignite panic anymore so I couldn't care less about it.

The thing that puzzels me is the lack of progress with my nocternal symptoms. The number of times I jolt awake in panic are less- maybe 5-10 times a night, and ones where I jump out of bed screaming are less often but still happen occasionally. But this improvement seems to have capped out around maybe April, while everything else has continued getting better. It's like the clenched fist is loosened during the day but it tightens right back up at night. I don't want to jinx it because I think letting go of trying to ""fix"" my symptoms was what made things get better. But I'm starting to get frustrated again. I've tried doing facial and scalp massages to relieve tension, yoga before bed, reading, warm baths. I've never found meditation helpful. I'm at a loss of what I should do.",1758401259.0,panicdisorder

1nlaaj7,Sound like panic attack?,"My psychiatrist thinks I had my first severe panic attack. I’ve been under extreme anxiety this last week, then took 1 10mg fluxotine. I take lamictal and Wellbutrin (occasionally Adderall recreationally, but5mg a day) as well. That evening I had a horrifying experience.

I was completely fine, lying in bed trying to sleep, when suddenly I saw a bright white light that got brighter and brighter for about 5 seconds maybe? It’s like I wasn’t aware of anything but the light. After, I felt disoriented, felt weird sensations (like coolness rushing to the back of my head and legs), like I couldn’t process anything, weakness, and just stared off for a long time. I felt like a completely different person. I had INTENSE fear and my mind kept saying “something is very wrong” over and over again. It was like my brain did a full reboot. I eventually fell asleep about 2 hours later. 

I had some concerns of serotonin syndrome and possible seizure, but she said it sounds pretty on par for a severe panic attack with dissociative features. Anybody else been through something like this? ",1758303873.0,panicdisorder
1nkwztf,My journey with panic,"Hello, 46y/o here.

I had my first panic attack on May 4th of this year while eating dinner. I thought I was having a heart attack and the ambulance was called and I went to the ER. They did a full body exam and bloodwork there with XRAYs. I received a clean bill of health. The following couple weeks were not fun with fear of another attack and general unwell feelings. I quit drinking alcohol, go off sugar and caffeine as well, and my only solace was when I exercised. I finally went to see a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with general panic disorder. I was put on Setraline at 25mg which was increased to 50 and eventually 75mg. I also was given Etizolam .5mg for when things got really bad. I have had lots of ups and downs the past 4 months. Everything from chest tightness, feelings of going crazy, intrusive thoughts, despair etc. I bought a home ekg meter and blood pressure checking device cause I was so scared for my health. The past few weeks though I have noticed a marked improvement it is my 9th week on 75mg of setraline. Last night while having a snack I started to have blurred vision dizzyness and a strong fear of death. It was my worst attack since May 4th. I realized it for what it was and didn't freak out too much though. I took my Etizolam and tried to do my breathing exercises and went to bed. Today I am having a panic hangover over though pretty badly.

I’m a devout Christian and sticking to my faith helps but also I know if you’re in this sub you can relate to the debilitating symptoms of anxiety and panic. I’m prescribed 4MG klonopin a day, SSRIs don’t work on me they actually cause me to get worse. I’ve been on klonopin for 3 years now and I’m considering weaning off because there’s always a tolorance issue.

So here’s my question, what supplements have genuinely helped you guys feel relived and “normal”? When I take my klonopin I feel like I’m supposed to feel. No anxiety no intrusive thoughts just being alive. Why can’t I just feel that way without the medication or with a different med? There’s gotta be something out there that works. I haven’t tried magnesium glycinate and I am prescribed propranolol but I’m scared to take it bc I’ve had such bad reactions to meds so If anyone has any experiences with propranolol especially mixed with a Benzo I’d love to hear your experience.

1nhtaas,Dentist Success,"Hey, All

Just wanted to share with everyone that I just came back from the dentist from a deep cleaning after months of rescheduling and I survived. 

Not here to say it was an easy task, I almost bailed in the parking lot and when I walked in. But I just kept thinking of the positives. 

I did have panic symptoms. My heart rate felt like I was running a marathon, palms sweaty and my throat felt like it wanted to shut, but I pushed through. 

So anyways, I guess the point of this post is for anyone struggling with a mental block of something they’ve been putting off because of panic disorder, don’t always let it win!

If you’re struggling with going to the dentist, I suggest finding a well rated one, thankfully they were very nice at my center and allowed me to take as many breaks as I wanted. (I had to pause 3 times lol).

1nhqi47,Xanax to manage panic?,"I struggle with panic disorder, mostly around speaking or presenting when I’m the sole focus (especially with execs). Even something as simple as introducing myself in front of a room can trigger a panic attack.

It started in 2018 after a big conference where I had my first full-blown attack (thought it was a heart attack, ended up in the hospital). Since then, my brain just won’t let it go.

On video calls, I can sometimes “numb” it with alcohol, but obviously that doesn’t work in person. I’ve tried things like Ka’Chava and beta blockers—beta blockers help a little, but not with the buildup.

I’m curious about people’s experiences using Xanax situationally for this type of anxiety. I wouldn’t want to be on it full time—still planning to keep up with therapy, CBT, breathing, etc.—but wondering if it’s been helpful for anyone else in similar situations.

1nhbpe2,TW/ feeling very hopeless,"TLDR/ TW: suicidal thoughts, derealization, loneliness, existential crisis

basically I've hit rock bottom and everything seems impossible for me



Hi, 20, about to be 21F and have had panic disorder for 2 years. I did get better for a year on lexapro, got off of it, got back on after a few months, had a horrid traumatizing panic attack with 0 rational thinking and now have been stuck in complete rock bottom since May. I have been trying so hard to stay positive and find solutions/coping skills, but at this point all I can think of is giving up and have had the worst suicidal ideation I've ever experienced. I would never do it because I am terrified of death and passing the pain torch to more people, but I feel like this giant burden to everyone. I have been so isolated this entire summer and have gone out here and there only with my boyfriend to concerts,faires, etc as exposure therapy, but I am so tired of it being for that instead of just enjoying myself. I am constantly crying, constantly having this giant weight on myself and constantly checking myself. It has gotten to a point to where its strained my relationship so much because he is just parenting and taking care of me and I don't blame him for building some resentment. I try to hold back, but if I don't I feel so trapped in my head and lonely. I do have parents, but they are 2 very selfish people and I have both mommy n daddy issues from them both and am currently having a lot of problems with my mom. I was doing a little better end of august and then my mom randomly decided to ban my boyfriend from sleeping over completely. Now I know this will sound dramatic and very teenager of me, but this broke me. My boyfriend is my complete support system and has been there for me through everything especially this summer. My mom has not whatsoever and never has been my whole life. He is the reason I got my license last year, he takes me to appointments, he does absolutely everything. Since then, my deep void full of resentment towards my mom has come back and I've gotten so much worse bc I am just alone every night when everything is worse at night. I watch videos on TikTok of daughters posting their moms and being proud to have them as their mom and it just breaks me because I wish I could have that, but I have been begging her to change for so long. My birthday is next weekend too and I don't even want to have a party or anything, I have 2 friends, I've been antisocial all summer so idek how to socialize at this point, and I feel like I am just running backwards chasing my childhood. Basically, to wrap this up. I can't stop thinking existentially, I am in this dark deep derealization that feels impossible to ever change and has made me think im in psychosis and fully losing my mind, I have bad mommy issues, and I am so tired of fighting. if you read all of this thank you, there is a lot lot more, but I have already rambled so much, so im just leaving it here",1757908307.0,panicdisorder

My only symptom tbh is I get extremely nauseous from doing anything. Triggers seem to be related to doing any sort of physical activity and talking. Any talking, any activity (like putting on clothes) can trigger extreme nausea.

Otherwise honestly I don't think I have any of the other usual symptoms of panic disorder. Maybe once in a while I do, I think related to stress. But by and large, my nausea just... happens.

So, it’s not my heart that makes me feel so dizzy and like I can’t breathe.

When I got out of the car and wanted to go inside, I felt my body had no strength, I was ready to faint at any moment.

Sometimes I try to resist the urge to check my throat because I know it's keeping me stuck in this loop. But if I don't check, I just sit there panicking and I almost can't stop myself from checking because when I look and see that it's not closing, it gives me some reassurance (which i know isn't helping in the long run). It's gotten so out of control that I'll experience numbness in my face/mouth, tingling, ""shortness of breath"", lightheadedness, etc. I'm just so tired of living this way. I'm tired in general...it's so exhausting. I don't want this to be my life. I'm on medication and it has helped alot, but it's still very much controlling my life. I wanna do fun things, I wanna go out, I wanna try new and exciting things...I wanna have kids in the near future but I can't bring a child into this world and care for it in the mental state I'm in. I don't know what to do...I just know I'm tired. Every time it happens, I literally think ""oh great...this again"". I don't see this particular anxiety theme talked about alot so I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced the same thing? Did anything help you? I just feel so alone.

1ndndsb,first therapy appointment,"about a month ago i was almost hit by an irresponsible driver and then a week after that i witnessed a car wreck and saw someone’s lifeless body being carried out on a stretcher. since that, i pretty much have not left the house. i already have a history of panic disorder/ gad and this exacerbated things immensely. i have panic attacks in the shower, cannot drive anywhere and simply leaving the house to go for a walk makes me panic. i went to the ER last night because i was having chest pain and everything came back normal. most of my day is spent in the house zoning in and out, derealization episodes and getting these ups and downs of adrenaline. 

i’ve been on kpin 0.5mg for about 10 years and it generally works well but lately the panic has been unbearable so my doctor did prescribe propranolol 60mg ER to take but i’m so scared to try it. anyways, i know this is a long rant but i’m 26 yrs old and feel embarrassed that i can’t even leave the house to go to a dentist appointment over all this. so my first virtual therapy appointment is tomorrow long story short… anyone else experience a similar event? going though something similar?

1nd23ww,Please read this.Please.,"I have always been a very anxious kid, attached to my moms hip since birth, sleeping with my parents on and off until middle school,  i would cry and hold onto the stair railing with my mother pulling my feet when I would have to go to school.. why? Because I was so scared and absoulutley dreaded going to school and dealing with what I now know was GAD and panic disorder, I had my first panic attack in kingergarden on the carpet during a lesson, i was nauseus, in fight or flight, begging for my mom, was in and out of the nurse constantly all through out Elementery school always having a ""Stomach ache and feeling sick"" (was anxiety). Things got better through out the start of middle school, but they always ebbed and flowed, I never ate because I always felt sick constantly from anxiety at school, i was petrified of being trapped in school lunch detention, it was terrible. Covid hit in late middle school and it was amazing, though my depression got a little harsh, it was managable, but anxiety- gone. I absoultely loved being home and in my space with my family feelimg safe, but when things started to get better, i wsas constantly worrying about having to go back, breaks and long weekends were always hard for me in school and it was a rough adjusemnt to get back in routine. Anyway, covid got better, i got into high school and it was fine at first, i didnt really have many friends but didnt mind, but where it got bad was my sophmore year. I expierenced a bad breakup but dealt with it pretyt well, i was given a flash pass to see the counsleor whenevr I needed, but they couldnt help. The anxiety was constant, id go to the counslors every morning begging her to let me stay with her in her office, when she would walk me near my class my anxiety would be terrible, at the end of my 10th grade year she basically gave up on me, she couldnt help me like I needed, not that it was much help anyway there, so I was sent off to a alternative school, it was great to have a smaller school, but I later on found out the school was for kids who were suspended, so that didnt last long. Got involved with the wrong crowd and into substances, I started online school as i dreamed of since a kid, graduated a year early and was set. I thought i was free, my panic stems from being ""trapped"", i took some time off to just relax and started working at a daycare, the anxiety never went away, i would fele trapped and wanted to leave my room always and walk to different classes to try to get my mind off of it. I ended up leaving due to managment a handful of months later, and took a 3 month break, got a new job at a childrens play museam and constantly battled anxiety non stop, always so anxious and feeling so sick and trapped, one day I went to work and the minute i got there I had a terrible panic attack, I was sobbing, felt like I couldnt breathe, just broke down, i called out and went home, and eventually quit due to the panic and the way the job handled the situation. Since then, i have tried to heal this anxiety, with the gym, outside, religon, going on walks, i have tried over 10 medications for this terrible disorder , nothing ever sticks. I had a mental crisis one day, and my life changed forever, i had nonstop panic attacks, begging my mom for an abulance , to make it end, i cant do this, please make it stop, my entire body shaking and trembling uncontrolably , heart racing, sweating, in absoulute fight or flight, icing wouldnt help, medicine wouldnt help, nothing would. I got a rx for xanax and started on some prozac again for this acute episode and it helped until it didnt as usual, im now in IOP, and just stepped down from PHP, i cant do hardly anything alone, i can only drive 10 minutes away by myself as long as there isnt stop lights  that will make me feel trapped, my mom cant go more than 5 mins away without me, I cant go to appointments, only telehealth, I cant see family outside the house, or friends, my biggest acomplishment has been going to the store for 30 minutes with my family. I feel so at loss here, i always dealt with minor random sucidal thoughts in tough spots, but lately its all i feel, I cant live in a way like this, its no way for a human to live, can someone please give me hope. I have to be with my mom 24/7 and it has been terrible, she get so mad at me for little things and hates that she cant live her life like she used to , but I have no control, I feel so hopeless and I cant even see myself living a year from now like this, its absoultuely misreable. Ive been telling myself it will get better my entire life, but its so hard. If anyone could reach out with some advice or kind words it would mean wonders, all i really have is my family and I am a huge burden on them. ",1757470337.0,panicdisorder

1naz780,Buspar for panic disorder,"
I am 25f, have panic disorder w cluster c traits. I dont have panic attacks every single day, but i am constantly warding them off, and its exhausting. My current medication regimen is 225mg venlafaxine, 100mg sertraline, 1mg flupentixol. Originally it was just the venlafaxine and flupentixol, but the sertraline was added to help my pmdd and to make it possible to taper off the flupentixol. I have been on this dose for about 5 weeks, and my pmdd is near non existent now, and i do feel generally better in myself. I do however, still have to use my emergency diazepam sometimes, like for my driving lessons, but before i needed 10mg, last week i was able to just take 5mg and have a good time. Diazepam doesn't make me sleepy at all (propanalol does), so it is totally safe for me to use when driving.



I wasn't really able to talk to my preferred doctor about which extra antidepressant i wanted, i got a doctor i still like, but wasnt there for when i was really ill, so he doesnt have the full context that my regular doctor does. I did ask him to talk to my old psychiatrist (bc im no longer in crisis, ive been discharged from psychiatry), and he said i could either have buspar or sertraline. The gp went for sertraline, probably because its extremely common here in the uk, my mum takes it for depression and its been great for her.



I am generally having a good time on sertraline, and i hope i can make a small taper to my antipsychotics in the Christmas holidays at least. I am also aware it hasnt been the full 6 weeks, so i may feel even better with more time. I do however, wonder, if buspar would've been better for me, since it works like a benzo apparently? And benzos are an absolute lifesaver for me, but, as i learned the hard way as a teenager with an incompetent child psychiatrist, i cannot take benzos every single day, bc i got addicted and the withdrawal made me housebound.



I have been taking the benzos as an when needed for about 2 years, with my tolerance going up slightly (originally i used 2mg pills, i use 5mg pills now), but i don't take them every single day. I am only given 15 pills per month, and that generally lasts just over a month.



I am wondering if people who have been on buspar for panic disorder have had a good experience, and been able to largely stop using benzos bc of it. I am aware that buspar is apparently great for generalised anxiety disorder, but its not a well established treatment for panic disorder, so i decided to ask you guys

1nakqet,First panic in years,"I (28F) had a run in with my meds (lexapro 20mgs) and couldn’t get them for 5 days. I honestly didn’t feel too bad without them some dizziness and bad night mares.

I went to the zoo with my daughter and was carrying her up a pretty steep hill when all of a sudden my heart starts beating out of my chest and I feel like I can’t breathe which then comes with nausea and feeling like I’m going to faint. 

This has kicked my health related ocd into overdrive and now I’m convinced that I have something seriously wrong with my heart. (Had a full work up less than 5 years ago and everything looked perfect).

As usual, it felt like it would never end, and I thought i would feel this way forever, but then I didn't. 
I realized after two days that i wasn't in flight or fight mode every second of my day, i don't know why it took me so long to realize.
But it did end, and I haven't had to take my emergency medication for two weeks, (still taking my other two meds as prescribed though of course) and I've been sleeping a pretty regular amount each night.
I still have moments, where I overthink and I get scared, and then I get scared that it will start again, but then the moment passes and its okay again. 

I'm mostly documenting this so I can remember the next time I'm in an episode that it will get better. And in the moment you never believe it because it feels so endless and you wonder, how could I ever move on from this?
But then it happens and i forget how bad it felt.
But I'm also documenting this for all the people who are currently in an episode and don't think it'll ever stop, but it will. And you won't realize until its over, and you will be okay. And if it happens again, again it will end, and again it will be okay.

1na60ik,I fainted at the dentist,"Hi all,

I was diagnosed with panic disorder about 12 years ago when I was in grad school after my first panic attack. When I was first diagnosed I was prescribed a low dose of clonazepam to take as needed. After about 3 years, the panic has subsided to the point where I forgot I even struggled with it and haven't taken medication in about 7 years.

Fast forward to two months ago. I go into the dentist for an implant procedure and I warn them that my usual dentist avoids giving me numbing that contains epinephrine because it's made me feel sick/heart racing in the past. They gave me epinephrine anyway and I passed out for the first time in my life. I'm talking within 30 seconds I feel sick to my stomach and lights out, no big lead up.

I wrote it off as a sensitivity to the medication and that's that. Then two weeks ago I am in for a follow up and they remember me, we speak about absolutely no epinephrine. They gave me what they claim is lidocaine, but within 30 seconds, lights out again. I didn't think much of it and assumed maybe the cotton swab they give you first had some epi in it without realizing.

The next day I'm getting my haircut and suddenly my brain is like ""hey, what if those two times you passed out weren't due to epinephrine at all, but it was just a panic attack? What if this is a thing now and you can pass out at any time?"". So I had my first full blown panic attack in 10 years right there in the barber chair. No one noticed I think, but I had to have my wife come pick me up because I was worried about fainting while driving.

If I had definitive proof that there was epi in the numbing in my last visit, I think I would be able to reconcile what's happening and make myself believe I won't just pass out randomly. But that's almost impossible.

Now I can barely go in public/drive/go to work without constantly thinking that I might faint and either crash my car or embarrass myself, which in turn, causes panic attacks.

Anyone else have something similar to this happen to them or how they got over it? I don't really know what I plan on getting out of this post, just venting at this point and maybe to gleam some hope that people don't just faint from panic attacks without a build up.",1757181125.0,panicdisorder

However I just went to the dentist yesterday, and I found out that I have really bad panic attacks while I’m there. They told me I need to get my wisdom teeth removed, but I’m terrified of going under anesthesia. They said I don’t have to go under, but when the dentist was just looking in my mouth with the mirror and poky thing I was freaking out like crazy. I don’t know what to do they said I have to get it done otherwise my whole mouth could be messed up in the long run. I’m honestly really freaked out and don’t know what to do. Anybody here have their wisdom teeth removed and what do they recommend as far as dealing with that anxiety? I’m more worried about waking up being loopy and freaking tf out.

my psychiatrist prescribed me .5mg lorazepam to take in emergencies and i get 5 pills each month - it does help in the moment, but i end up hoarding the pills and not always taking it when i should because i'm afraid i'll be left without my safety when i really need it. she doesn't want to give me more and instead added hydroxyzine as needed in tandem with gabapentin which i've been taking since this all started. i've also been on zoloft for 3 months to manage the anxiety.

1n6xa78,Consistent Numb Feeling?,"Hi everyone, me again.

About a week ago I had a panic attack that lasted several hours and one of the symptoms I had was my left forearm/arm began feeling numb as well as a bit of my face. My medical anxiety made me extremely worried that I was about to have a stroke (I didn't) and that anxiety has still been with me all week.

It's been 5 days and my arm still sometimes feels like it's numb or like it's not even part of my body, but it functions just fine (feels pain, can be raised, can hold things/heavy weight like normal, etc.) Same for part of my cheek but less so.  
I gotta add I'm noticing it usually only feels this way when I'm not doing anything else or rather have time to focus on it because when I'm not occupying myself otherwise it's usually the only thing my brain does decide to focus on (like automatic paranoia.)

Does anyone else have experience with this? Limbs feeling odd for a prolonged time post-panic attack? It never felt like this before, only once the attack happened.

I may still get it looked at, but I just want some advice.

Note: this was my first proper panic attack (came on suddenly with no warning compared to my usual anxiety attacks.)",1756851161.0,panicdisorder

I was at a friend's house, we all were sitting at his dining table enjoying food, after one bite I suddenly feel I have forgotten how to swallow, the panic set in and I felt as if I was gonna throw up. I left the food citing stomach ache. Now I had to visit another friend next weekend, and as soon as I enter his house, I start feeling something in my stomach, something unusual. When we sat on his dining table and as soon as I saw the food I started to feel nausea. I tried eating but I just couldn't swallow. It's been a month and I can't eat with other people. I invited my friends to see if I was comfortable at my place but I couldn't eat even at my place. I tried going out with a friend, tried forcing myself, a few bites were fine but then came an uncomfortable bite and boom I can't swallow anymore. It's been almost a month I have been struggling. I have started avoiding my friends, I have started to hate food. I hate nausea and vomiting so whenever that feeling kicks in, my mouth shuts down.

1n5ktb6,Couldn't move,"This was a really weird experience, wondering if anyone else has had this? I'm scared of it happening again (even though I know that's a symptom lol)

I had a terrible panic attack yesterday where I got pretty anxious and realized I couldn't get up and do some anti panic tactics (cold water on my face, run around etc.). Soon enough, I could only move my eyes, it feel like every muscle in my body was super tense. I almost felt like my eyes wanted to just look in one direction and I almost felt like I lost myself (idk if that makes sense. It felt like my eyes were going to gloss over) My heart was beating so so fast (I know that thinking that it was a heart attack is a symptom but I genuinely thought I was past that point) and I was just crying (more that tears were coming out because I couldn't move my face) I eventually gained my tongue and enough of my face to barely talk- enough to call my partner. I spent like 2 hours in my partners arms while they moved parts of my body around so I would gain control again.

1n5c4fc,Bring It On approach,"Hi everyone! I thought I'd share this since it's the only thing so far that I've found helps with panic attacks in the moment, and with the worry about having them. I heard Kimberly Quinlan (host of Your Anxiety Toolkit podcast) talk in one episode about her struggles with panic attacks and how she now utilizes and encourages others to try the ""Bring It On"" approach - essentially when you feel one coming on, aggressively confront it, i.e., say to yourself ""BRING IT ON"" or something like ""Ok, hit me!"". When you stop trying to settle the panic attack, it only usually makes it worse. I tried the Bring It On approach and it surprisingly works quite well for me! Sharing in case anyone else could find it helpful.

This approach stems from your own *willingness* to feel the anxiety and symptoms of panic. You first have to be willing, with the knowledge that a panic attack can't actually hurt you. Once you're willing, you can implement the aggressive confrontation. I hope this can help someone else the way it helped me!

1n4np3u,Klonopin experience,"I'm not sure if this is the right community to post this in so apologies if it's not appropriate.

I went to the emergency room hospital because my legs were shaking uncontrollably in extreme pain. I was given 0.5mg Klonopin. I was told it is sometimes used for restless leg syndrome and since my legs were involuntary shaking  I assumed it would help. They sent me home with 6  pills that were 0.5mg with instructions to take 1-2 pills before bed if needed. 

I went home and took another 0.5mg of klonopin. Within 60 mins my legs were feeling some relief but I still could not sleep and felt a sense of panic. I decided to take another 0.5mg. In total I've now taken 1.5mg.

Now this is were it gets weird....

I remember falling asleep and my panic disappearing. Everything after that I vaguely remember like it was a fever dream. I vaguely remember getting out of bed 4 to 5 times and having a hot shower, but I could hardly walk straight and was not able to balance myself. I guess I felt drunk in a way. I remember waking up a few times with intense dehydration. I remember being so incredibly tired I couldn't even standup for more then 3 mins without falling back into bed. I vaguely remember waking up multiple times from super realistic feeling dreams (like reading a comic book word for word and seeing the pictures even though I don't own a comic book lmao) 

I wake up finally somewhat coherent the next day and a half and notice my bottle of klonopin is EMPTY and on the floor under my bed. What the hell? I do NOT remember taking any more then the hospital dose and the two 0.5mg pills at home. That means I took 3.5mg of Klonopin total.

I am so confused...

Then I notice a huge chuck of skin taken out of my thumb? I must've cut it on something but I can't find blood anywhere or what I might hurt it on. 

I am still feeling very very very tired. I've had to stop what I'm doing multiple times today to sleep. My leg, back and neck muscles are indescribably sore and tender. It is almost impossible to bend down my leg muscles are so sore. My mind is blank. I have no thoughts, just confusion. 

I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has had an experience with Klonopin where you unknownly took more pills?? ",1756622198.0,panicdisorder
1n4bbc1,My PD came back,"This is my very first post on Reddit so Im sorry if I did something wrong, and also english is not my own language so sorry if there's mistakes! 

Anyway, I got PD when I was around 17-18yo. (Im now 30) It was really really bad time for me.. I got medication and got better. For years now I havent got panic attacks or at least they have been mild. I have been on meds for years. I was doing great and even just got started adhd studies(dont know the right word) if I have that condition as well. Well last year we talked with my doctor if I can try life without meds. (I use ssri, escitalopram) I drove them down really, really slowly.

Now, you need to know I have trouble with alcohol. This year went better I didnt drink much until summer it kind of took me over and I drunk much again..

So now, 3 weeks ago on friday. I had been little bit over a week without my meds and went drinking with my friends. I drunk way too much. Next day is when this hell started. First I was okay, hangover but fine. Then, I guess when alcohol had truly left my body it hitted. The most awful, horrible panic attack I ever had. I felt really wierd symptoms in my head and was sure im gonna die. I just screamed help to my boyfriend and Im gonna die. He called an ambulance. I was shaking like crazy. Ambulance really didnt do anything just saying I need to stop drinking. I promise you, that I did. 

Since then my nervous system is a complete mess. 3 weeks I've lived this hell. Why I cant calm down? On that saturday I started to take my meds again. On lowest dose 'cause you need to start slowly and also quit slowly. And then there is this thing. Usually in situation like this you get reception on something sedative med (I hope thats the right word on that) until your ssri starts working. But in my country if u have any history with alcohol u dont get them. I get it, but I was going crazy so I bought them elsewhere. Just mild, something to keep me in my senses. 

Without them I dont know how I can handle this. 
And again, I can assure you, Im not gonna drink anymore that saturday cause trauma of drinking.

So what happened to me? Was it these two things together, being without meds and heavy drinking. I was doing so good now it started again after over ten years. Its been 3 weeks and without sedative Im constantly very anxious, like edge of getting panic attack all the time! And get them too. Im exhausted. Im still eating the minimum dose of ssri, I guess I should start increase the dose cause Im still not feeling normal. I cant go to work just panicking at home. But also am little bit scared to increase the dose if that makes this worse for a little while until it gets better.. I dont know. Im sorry for a very long story just wanted to talk to somewhere.

They treated me and performed every blood test, from heart enzymes to my kidneys and liver—everything is  normal. My life became a cycle of going from home to the emergency room. I started suffering from blood pressure attacks, heart palpitations, irritable bowel syndrome, and body spasms to the point of paralysis. The slightest sound, even the sound of a door opening, would make me tremble. I needed to go to the bathroom every 5 to 30 minutes. I felt shortness of breath, a weight on my chest, and the sensation of dying and my heart stopping. They ran every available test: blood sugar, liver, kidneys, endocrine glands, vitamins, chest X-rays, a heart echo, and an ECG, and all came  normal. There was no longer a spot left on my body for a needle to draw blood. I went back to the gym, afraid I would die on the treadmill, but I completed my workout. Today, I had an attack so severe that I thought I was going to have a heart attack, especially when I was trying to sleep. I feel like my body is melting and I can't move my limbs properly.

I’ll have to fly tomorrow morning, and i’m afraid. 

In january i developed bad agoraphobia, went on one flight since then, and it was very bad. Never had one on my previous four flights i went on before developing agoraphobia. 

I had a panic attack upon departure. I was tense while looking for my seat, i sat down and as the people started boarding, i felt the tension rise. The seat felt uncomfortable, my heart began accelerating, i started feeling shaky and my hands were sweating. As the plane began moving on the tarmac i went into full panic mode, i knew there was nothing i could do at that point to go back or escape. I was trapped there, whether i liked it or not, no way out, for one hour and a half. 

The panic attack lasted 20 mins. A flight attendant asked me if everything was fine, she said i was pale and sweating. I said i was having a panic attack. She said “oh okay” and proceeded with her duties, which leads me to believe it is a common occurrence for them. 

But even tho it happened twice (once when going and then when returning home) i am scared i’ll have one again. The feeling of dread, of pure fear, knowing you have nowhere to escape to is terrifying. ",1756477149.0,panicdisorder
1n36a9z,In an Ativan Predicament!,"
I have had health anxiety that progressed into panic disorder over the last couple years. I have been in therapy and started spacing out the frequency of the panic attacks. Usually, when I do have panic attacks, they make me think I'm dying (sometimes send me to the ER) and then I typically fall asleep that night and tend to recover. 

About 8 days ago I had a bad panic attack sortof out of the blue (usually they are more closely tied to an upcoming event). This particular one made it to where I couldn't sleep for 2 or 3 days or eat. I went to the hospital because I was collapsing and they gave me 1mg of Ativan which worked like a charm. They also wanted me to get on lexapro, which I have never gotten on am ssri before. 

Long story short, I have been taking the Ativan daily at .75mg 1 time at night for sleep. Today will be 8 days in a row. I see horror stories about how Ativan has ruined people and the withdraw effects are terrible, and I would love to avoid those. The only problem is, twice I have tried to fall asleep at night without it and both times resulted in a panic attack and a sleepless night. I'm afraid I will never be able to sleep again without it, but I also don't want to take it anymore!

My psychiatrist really wants me to take it every day for about a month (or however long it takes) until my baseline returns. The only reason I'm not able to sleep is because I've gained some sleep anxiety from this panic attack. I can sleep during the day when my daughter goes down for nap time, but when it's night time I can't sleep without it. 

The main problem is the physical sensations.. I feel like my skin has icy hot all over it and I'm tired but I can't fall asleep. I've been looking at other medications (like propranolol) but it hasn't really worked. Again the underlying cause of me not sleeping is anxiety, I've always been a good sleeper with good sleep habits. I've tried the whole grounding and breathing thing but nothing can take me out of the state I'm in for some reason.

So, do I stay on ativan until the Lexapro kicks in (and may or may not work according to people on here)? Or do I try to get off ativan now and face the music? 
Last night I tried to do exactly that and I got exactly 0 hours of sleep. Can you take ativan for a month or so and taper off no side effects?

1n2y4lk,2 month update,"Hey I just wanted to give an update on my panic disorder after 2 months of recovery mostly for myself. 3 months ago I had a relapse in my panic disorder where I couldn't eat and it got to a point where I was feeling very suicidal from all the mental and physical pain I was facing everyday. 

Now around 2 months later I'm feeling way better. I finally got a job in a small local coffee shop that I really enjoy with coworkers that are really chill and kind. I reconnected with my high-school best friend and we're hanging out pretty regularly. I still have some anxious and depressing thoughts everyday usually when I'm not doing anything, but at least theyre not happening 24/7. And sometimes I feel tense and anxious in the mornings.

 It's scary for me to think of the future but I'm really trying to just enjoy right now. That's my only goal ",1756442338.0,panicdisorder
1n2xpa3,okay to use coping mechs?,"maybe a dumb question sorry.

but when i have panic attacks i tend to go right to coping mechanisms such as distractions (often i play a game either on my phone or a handheld console such as my 2ds or switch), holding an ice pack, lighting candles, etc. i also tend to go right to my safe space, which for me is my bathroom, because of how nauseous i get with my panic attacks...

i guess my question is mostly just, like, is it okay for me to use these? i try to sit with the panic as long as i can sometimes, it depends on how much stress/anxiety i already am having. like, for instance, i Just had (am having?) a panic attack out of nowhere, and i've had a very off day today so i just didn't have it in me to sit with it first. i immediately did my usual coping mechanisms and now i'm here.

so, is it harnful to do this? even for the bad ones or the ones that happen on bad days? i worry it's actually more detrimental to my recovery than helpful. because, now i worry sometimes about what i will do if i get one in a place or situation where i *can't* use these coping mechanisms...? does this make sense? :-(",1756440914.0,panicdisorder
1n2ngbe,Panic Attack or Stroke,"23 F

Hi everyone, I think last night I might have had my first panic attack and I'm not sure how to accept it.

A little bit about me: I've had absolutely terrible anxiety all my life and am no stranger to anxiety attacks which come on suddenly and in the moment. I've always had terrible health anxiety as well/hypochondria, despite my health always being average/normal. Tying into what could have triggered it last night, I've also had some recent social drama and also I'm currently moving abroad in 3 days to live in the UK for 4 months. I've been surprisingly nonchalant about all of this until yesterday.

So yesterday I started feeling really warm and hot and dizzy after walking around all day and I got home and decided to lie down, only for my head to then suddenly start feeling really light and I got a bit nauseous. That's when the panic started to creep up on me, and my hand started tingling a little bit. My brother was with me and said my hand did feel slightly colder than my other, as well as my heartbeat running a little fast. That's when I started panicking a bit more and my breathing felt more difficult. Due to my stupid health anxiety, I started thinking I was going to have a stroke because now it felt like only one side of my head/face was becoming heavy/numb. I kept checking in with my brother that my face wasn't drooping and my hands could both still be raised/squeeze (which they could.) I also called my friend who is a nurse and he said by the sounds of it all it didn't sound like a stroke because those happen suddenly and it would be very dramatic. This went on for about an hour. We were late to go see some friends and I thought I was ok again and we took an Uber, only for me to begin feeling panicky again in the car (fast heartrate and quicker breathing/lightheadedness) and it was only when we got to the friends place that I realized I wasn't feeling it and it was best for me to go home. They gave me some water as I explained, and as I was explaining I suddenly felt ok again but still decided to head home to lie down.

When I got home and laid down for a bit, all I'm self analyzing myself for was if I was having warning signs of a stroke or not. Suddenly my heart starts beating fast again and now I'm convinced I'm smelling gasoline. I go to the kitchen and sit with my mom while my brother makes me some tea because I just wanted to be near people. My mom was watching me and then I felt the most intense wave of panic while simultaneously my left forearm and hand went numb for a split second which only caused further panic as I was now convinced I was either about to have a stroke, or I was getting warning signs of a stroke creeping up. The thing is, I wasn't hyperventilating and my breathing was only slightly erratic, mostly whimpering, but my left leg had the nervous jitters while I was also confused, fumbling over my words, and it took a lot of energy to talk (I was understandable though and lucid.) Reality also didn't feel right but I've always sorta had minor derealization issues, this time it was just more intense. My mom helped me do some controlled breathing and I did start to calm down properly as it helped the symptoms go away, and then I felt really fatigued but at least my ability to talk got better. I went to go get some fresh air and then we both went to lie in her bed because I still wanted someone near me. I finally just closed my eyes and started doing the EMDR ""butterfly taps"" that my therapist has been telling me to do, and eventually fell asleep.

Today I've spent most of the day sleeping. I woke up absolutely exhausted for an early appointment to get some stitches removed (a result of a recent extreme medical scare where I was convinced for a month I had skin cancer. Results came back today: I don't 😁) and in the car on the way back I still had some slight panic start but managed to suppress it. Then I went back home and fell asleep only to wake up now this afternoon and make this post. I'm still convinced I'm feeling a little bit of numbness in my left arm even though it's functioning the exact same way as my right, and my left side of my head still hurts a bit but it's in a spot where I have been getting subtle headaches there anyway for a while now.

This is a long yapping way of saying that basically I'm super unfamiliar with panic attacks that happen after a long build up of worry, and because of how I am I can't tell what's more rational: that I had a series of panic attacks or I'm getting early warning signs of a stroke. I know panic attacks have a potential to mimic what you're worried about in the moment? Is that right? I have no idea. All I know is there is a high potential that I am more worried about the things that are currently going on in my life than I act like I am, and that I've just been brushing them all off until they possibly just exploded on me last night. My issue is that it didn't feel like a textbook definition of a panic attack? I don't even know.

Can panic attacks happen in a progression? Do they usually last this long?

Advice please 😭

  
Edit: As I was posting this, my left forearm/hand felt numb again while at the exact same time a wave of dread passed over me. I put my screen down and started doing the tapping again/breathing and I feel slightly better, but now I'm worried it's going to happen again. Fuck.",1756413225.0,panicdisorder
1n21fea,Symptoms changing?,"I swear panic is the most annoying troll of a condition. Like, when I first started having panic attacks, my heart racing absolutely terrified me. I was constantly checking my pulse, convinced I was going to drop dead. Eventually, after dealing with it a million times and realizing “ok, this hasn’t killed me yet,” I got less scared of it. I would think “this is just a panic attack” and move on.

And then what happens? My body (or my brain?) decides to swap symptoms on me. Suddenly it’s not about the heartbeat anymore, now it’s tingling in my hands, numbness in my face, random dizzy spells, whatever new thing it can come up with to freak me out. It feels like panic is this shapeshifter, once it realizes it can’t scare me with one thing, it just invents a new “what if??” symptom to latch onto.

Like, I almost imagine my anxiety going: “Oh, you’re not afraid of palpitations anymore? Cool, here’s some paresthesia, good luck with THAT one!”

Then I was prescribed diazepam. I took them for a years, on and off and never had an attack. Then I decided to quit due to its addictive property. I was doing fine. No attacks for few years. Then it started coming back. Another ambulance call but I never had to go to the ER. I had attacks a few times a year but it’s always on my mind. One of the new conditions I added was driving at night. I still do it but fear I’ll have an attack.

Fast forward, I have some health conditions. I take meds and first thing I do is if people have panic attack off of this med. Thankfully, most meds I take, that people do have panic attacks but never affected me. In fact, I didn’t even have any side effects even for the ones that commonly carry side effects.

I know of a couple of people who were prescribed meds and they didnt paint the best picture.
I hear about the side effects and takes a while to adjust and work. I hear sometimes you have to try different types as some meds can make you worse. Also i dont like the idea of becoming reliant on meds and then struggling to wean off them.

The only 'natural' remedy i have tried so far is taking away caffeine and also taking daily cbd capsules and gummies (no thc). Also taken vit b6 a few times a week and cod liver oil a few times a week (alternating these 2).

I have attacks daily. It is excruciating. And no matter how many I have, the brain is so insanely good at making it impossible to ever acclimate or become desensitized to it. This primal fear of dying is so hard coded that no rationalizing can truly take you out of it. 

The idea that there are so many people, the majority, who never even have to deal with this a single time in their entire lives is such an unfathomable thought to me. They will never know how some of us would do *anything* to never have to suffer from this ever again. And it’s so invisible to the rest of the world.

1n0w0o4,I got my life back,"18F with panic disorder, agoraphobia and possibly GAD

I feel like no one around me really understand how hard I've been struggling and therefor how happy I am to finally be back, so I want to write this so people with the same struggles can get some hope and maybe cheer for me.

I've had anxiety my whole life and I few years ago i started having panic attacks. Not really big ones, and not often at all but still enough to make presentations and meetings a little hard. It was already hard here since I used to be very social, I felt like I lost my personality.

A year ago my mom passed away after being sick for 2 years. The first month everything went okay, I was going to school everyday and still hanging out with friends. Then, suddenly one day after not eating enough I almost fainted at the dinner table. We went to the ER and everything seemed fine, I didn't think much of it.

A few days later I got almost the same feeling again but in the classroom. I ran outside as fast as I could and ended up in a really big panic attack on the floor by the lockers. I called my friend and she followed me halfway home. The whole time I felt like I was dying and it took so long to get home because I had to get off the bus every 5 minutes. This went on for probably 1,5 hour until I got home.

The following days I went to school, got a bad panic attack and then went home, everyday for a week, on repeat. Friday, that week, the panic attack got even worse. I was in a dissociated state and could barely talk. When I thought I was a little better, I tried to get home. I went on the bus and could barely breathe so I decided to get off. In the middle of nowhere I found myself laying on the bench at the bus stop, crying hysterically, barely being able to see or breathe. I called my dad and he picked me up. In the car I felt a little better, but I decided to take a week at home to rest.

After that I couldn't go back to school for the whole year. I struggled so hard I couldn't even go to the store anymore. I panicked even if I had to eat dinner with my family. It got really bad. I had physical symptoms all of the time like locked jaw, dissociation, pain everywhere, vertigo.

I started doing lots and lots of research and realized that I have to start some type of exposure therapy. My dad tried to set me up with a therapist, but that failed because I couldn't even get myself to have the digital meetings. Every time I tried, it took all of my energy, but at least I got the diagnosis panic disorder. Now I knew what was wrong.

I decided that I HAVE to do something, so I took small steps. First I went to the store, many times, so I would get more comfortable to do the next step. I started trying to get on the metro and bus, which was very hard but got easier after a few times. I didn't even do anything, I just stayed on for a few stations and then went home again. But don't get mistaken, it was still REALLY hard and I went through many panic attacks. At this point people around me didn't see the progress because it was very subtle, but I did. It takes time, but you eventually get there.

I kept this going, and naturally I could take bigger steps every time. I also started learning that almost all of my symptoms were just because of my anxiety, which made it a little easier to handle. Every time I got a panic attack I reminded myself that it is just that. Easier said than done, and it takes a lot of practice. It doesn't take away the panic, but it usually makes it a little easier.

When summer started I tried to take EVERY opportunity I could to get out of home because I really wanted to get better. Of course, still really hard but now I could at least hang out with my friends. My goal was to get back to school after the summer break was over.

Last week my summer break ended and it was time for me to get back to school after not being there for a whole year. The first day we didn't have any real lessons which was good for me because that meant I could have a gentle start. I was really panicked the days before and especially on the way there, but I would NOT give up after all of this progress. I stayed the whole day and I was still very anxious and alert, but I kept reminding myself that this is only symptoms of my anxiety. When I came home I felt like I was finally back. I finally did it. I got my life back! Now I've had real lessons the last two days, and of course it's still very hard throughout the day, but at least I can do it, and it gets easier everyday!!!

Remember, it takes months and months, maybe even years for some, to see the progress. Don't give up.

It hadn't happened the entire semester, it started up again after it ended. I've been having issues with losing sleep due to nocturnal panic attacks on and off for over five years now. Last time it happened was last summer when I was at home.

The last few times I tried to stay the night, I drove an hour home in the middle of the night. I had to keep hitting myself to stay awake, it sucked.

I'm doing everything i'm supposed to. I have a relaxing nightly routine and a good sleep setting. I'm medicated. I use my therapy tools when I wake up but it still isn't enough.

1n06cq3,Greening out gave me PD,"Around 6 years ago I smoked too much weed and had the most terrifying experience of my life. I threw up everywhere without warning, was spinning for hours, felt not real, thought I was dying, thought I was brain dead, and had a 2 hour long panic attack about losing complete control of my body and not being able to speak words. Ever since then I’ve struggled with panic disorder and I’m almost positive that incident was the catalyst. It seems to be centered around a fear of not having control of my body or my situations. For example, I’m unable to take any unfamiliar medications since then because i’m afraid i’ll have a bad reaction or feel weird on it and then i’ll be stuck til it’s out of my system. If i take a pill i’ll make myself think im having a bad reaction and i’ll panic. I have weird muscle jerks occasionally and constantly have panic attacks about having a seizure, although I don’t have a seizure disorder. I’ll make up that my throat is closing up when it’s not, or that I can’t get a deep enough breath and I’ll die. I can’t ride on planes anymore because I feel trapped and impending doom, and I’ll convince myself I’m gonna throw up or have a panic attack and embarrass myself in front of the whole plane. It’s the fear of having “no way out.” I panic during weddings because I make myself believe i’m gonna throw up or have a panic attack in the middle of the wedding. Again, in that situation there’s no way out. I will have a panic attack at the thought of having a panic attack and having no way out. If the word “panic” pops into my brain, i’ll make myself panic.

I feel hopeless and out of control. This is ruining my life. I have panic attacks over no real visible tangible threat- it’s all in my head but I can’t stop it because i feel the physical symptoms (nausea, throat tight, chest tight, heart pounding, can’t breathe) and therefore it makes it feel real even if it’s “in my head.” Anyone else have this?

I used to be prescribed benzos, the only thing that worked, but doctors don't like to prescribe them anymore.

This has worn me out.

1myehkl,Zoloft/propranolol storys,"Im a 26F and have struggled with anxiety all my life. When I was 17 I had a panic attack at work that literally laid me out for 3 years. I have non stop anxiety and vertigo. Was in and out of the hospital and drs trying to get answers because I couldn’t accept it was anxiety. They prescribed Kpins and it was the most normal I could feel. But I still was agoraphobic and barely functioning. After 3 years of just pushing myself and having a better support system it all just kinda went away. And I stopped the medicine. Got married, had babies, got a job. Monday I had some sort of a panic attack out of no where and ever since I’ve been so out of it. Brain pressure, brain and chest feel like they’re on fire. I wake up out of a dead sleep with my heart racing. Even laying on my couch last night my heart rate got up to 130 but I felt so woozy and tired I didn’t even notice. The mornings are the worst. I’m shaking and nauseous and throwing up and just unwell. I reached out for help and they gave me Ativan to cool off. Then want me to start Zoloft and then prescribed propranolol for the heart racing but they are concerned because my blood pressure is already generally low while my resting heart rate is usually elevated. They want me to be cautious. Zoloft is 25mg and propranolol is 10mg. I’m looking for any success stories with Zoloft. Maybe some gentle warnings of what kind of side effects I could be looking at? Has anyone used these 2 in conjunction together and how did it go? I’m a little scared of the propranolol making my blood pressure get too low or nasty side effects from that. If anyone has read this far thank you, I’m just an anxious mama trying to make sure I’m here and present for my babies. I cannot let this anxiety/panic win! ",1755986774.0,panicdisorder
1my0858,POTS or panic attacks?!,"Hiya! 

I’m not sure if this is completely inappropriate to post (if anyone thinks this might harm more than help, or if it triggers anyone’s health anxiety, please let me know and i’ll take it down!) but i’m just flagging it for anyone who might be in the same position that I was in. I’ve been diagnosed with a condition called POTS (postural ortho static tachycardia syndrome), which is almost completely harmless (aside from the symptoms) and can show up almost exactly like a panic attack. 

When I would have what I was told were panic attacks, they would come completely out of nowhere, with no detectable trigger and it would feel like my brain was calm but my body was panicked. I felt like I was super dizzy and going to pass out almost every time. What was actually happening was my blood wasn’t circulating my body properly (my blood pressure was doing f all so it was just pooling) so my body was dumping a butt load of adrenaline into me to get my heart beating faster, breathing heavier, sweating, etc. 

The main diagnostic criteria is an increase of 30 beats per minute (bpm) within the first 10 minutes of going from a prone position to standing (the high bpm also has to be maintained for a little while), it’s something you can quite easily test for with an apple watch or heart monitor if your curious!

I’m sure this won’t apply to most of you on here, but oh my god do I wish someone had mentioned it to be before I started anti-deps and valium. 

Hope this helps some of you, it’s for sure changed my life!🫶🏻

1mxlo7u,26M: health anxiety help?,"I’m a 26-year-old guy and I’ve been struggling with something that’s driving me crazy. As a kid and teenager, I was heavily bullied — it only stopped around high school. After that, life seemed to go pretty well. In 2016 I got psoriasis (mild), which I could live with.

But about 2–3 years ago, the real trouble started: panic attacks, at first mostly about heart problems. Later it shifted into constant fear of cancer. Mostly skin cancer, because I have fair skin with lots of moles. Every spot, mark, or small change instantly triggers panic.

I already tried cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) at PsyQ, and it helped temporarily, but the anxiety keeps coming back. It feels like I’m stuck in a vicious cycle: stress → more symptoms → more fear → even more stress.

Could this all be connected to the bullying trauma from back then? Has anyone else dealt with persistent health anxiety and found ways to break the cycle? Any tips for therapies or long-term strategies would be super helpful.

Sometimes it makes me feel really desperate. Almost every day I end up obsessing about being sick, and it drains so much energy. Thanks in advance if you read this and respond 🙏",1755904703.0,panicdisorder

1mwjhzs,Racing heart laying down,"So about a month ago I had a panic attack from a heart monitor results that was sent as a message by my doctor but not really explained. It turned out that is was normal and not an issue at all once I finally got to see her in person. But before that happened I got put on lexapro and had a severe reaction the week I was on it and then went off it and felt 80% better.

Since this all started a month ago I've lost 9 lbs, I have to constantly run to the bathroom. I have low bp and work out a lot but the low bp has become a health anxiety fixation for me (OCD). I'm sure the weight loss is not helping the bp, and from some research panic can cause bp to drop after an attack? The thing thats worried me the most is the week before my period when this all started a month ago my heart would race when I laid down at night to sleep and wouldn't stop. This week it started again and I've been terrified and averaging about 5 hrs of sleep a night. 

My gp has told me to ""hydrate and increase sodium"" for my BP, but not much else. I left a message again today asking for a stomach medication that will hopefully calm this. Has anyone else experienced this?

1mwj86v,CBT Therapy for Panic,"I just had my third therapy session and today we started diving into CBT therapy and what it is etc. By the end of today’s session after we tried to fill out this CBT worksheet together my therapist and I came to the conclusion that before we get started on CBT we need to figure out the underlying cause for my panic attacks because my anxiety is 90% physical and 10% mental. My main issue with anxiety is being afraid of panic attacks and my heart beating fast and all the physical symptoms that go with them and not so much my thoughts and replacing one negative thought with a more positive one. 

So I guess my question is when you started therapy did you first have to figure out what was causing your panic attacks and work on desensitizing your body before you started CBT? Personally, from what I learned about CBT so far it doesn’t really seem like it will help me much with my main issue which is basically fear of fear and cardio phobia and fear of my heart beating fast and how sensitive my body is to basically anything stimulating like caffeine, action movies and even a call from an unknown caller can send me into a panic.

1mvns72,Symptoms keep changing,"I've been dealing with panic disorder for a while now, and a thought has been really bothering me.

For example, a few years ago, my main symptom was trembling, but now it's more about chest pain and palpitations. Recently, I've been feeling a burning sensation and cold flashes in my chest.

This change really scares me and makes me think, ""What if it's not a panic attack anymore? What if there's a real physical problem that my doctors have missed?""

To those who have experienced panic attacks for a long time, have you also noticed this kind of ""shape-shifting"" in your symptoms? Do the sensations change over time, and do they always remain temporary and harmless? It would really help me to know that I'm not alone in this experience.

It's been an ongoing journey that I am still fighting but  I started doing more self care and wanted to share what has been working for me. I know likely a lot of these have been shared before numerous times (nothing groundbreaking) but can be nice to have a reminder or push to engage in one of them. Some days one works better than another and vice versa

* **Grounding techniques** – I use the 5-4-3-2-1 method (5 things I see, 4 I can touch, 3 I can hear, 2 I can smell, 1 I can taste). It pulls me back into the present when I feel like I’m spinning out.
* **Breathing exercises** – Slow, deep belly breathing has been huge. I do 7-second inhales and 7-second exhales and focus on my stomach rising/falling instead of my chest.
* **Progressive muscle relaxation** – Tensing and releasing muscle groups helps release the physical tension that comes with panic.
* **Movement** – Sometimes a brisk walk or even shaking out my arms and legs helps burn off the adrenaline.
* **Reframing thoughts** – Reminding myself: “This is just panic, it’s not dangerous, and it will pass.” It doesn’t stop it immediately, but it keeps me from escalating.
* **Comfort tools** – Having a glass of cold water, holding an ice cube, or splashing my face helps regulate my body and makes me feel more in control.

1mtin18,Advice for you!,"Hey people!

I‘m a 26 Year old male from Germany that has been diagnosed with Panic Disorders since I‘m 20. I had a long and rough Journey. From Hospital visits weekly, reassuring etc. I did therapy and thankfully I haven‘t got these Panic Attacks anymore. And Even if they come they don’t bother me - I don’t freak out like before and why?

I would like to give you 6 things you can do starting from now on.

1: Get VapoRub at any pharmacy! I really tell you just go and get it. If you feel a Panic, discomforting feeling take it and apply it on your chest, or belly. Also put a bit on your nose. You‘ll breathe the easiest you ever did. Take it with you out, if you ever need to. It’s super comforting to sleep with it too.

2: Enough Hospitals and Ambulances, they won’t Save you - you don’t need saving you are completely fine. That’s why You’re here with us Reading it. It will pass, and each time you don’t go remind yourself of me. It’s a Victory. Panic and fear lives from Controlling you - but we will stop that from now on. Don’t go there/Call or seek reassurance. No they didn’t miss anything on you no you are not the Chosen one trust me. I promise that.

3: Rationalize it. Some of you maybe had 822727 panic attacks some maybe 6. but what happened? You weren’t harmed. You made it out completely fine. Yes it was shocking, you feel weak in that moment like okey now i‘m passing out. But guess what, you are here, you are fine. You rised as you do everyday since your panic attacks. It’s a Rush of adrenaline & Cortisol. It’s a cocktail of your nerves basically. Let it wear itself out, it won’t ever harm you. I promise. You’re Fine.

4: Don’t Let it stop you. Ever. Don’t go too fast but start to do the things that you actually used to Enjoy before your first Panic Attack came up. It’s completely fine you took a step back at life. The last months feel Like, what did I even do? I understand all the feelings we have in common. But slowly get back.

5: whatever you are avoiding controlls you. Exposé yourself, but don’t rush it, try slowly. For example before you used to run to the ER or have a tick to Call them directly Unwell. Tell yourself okey 5 minutes I wait and see, even if all the Cells in your Body scream rushhh to a „safe place“ Hospital or ER. Don’t, you don’t need it at all. And from there on work on more steps.

6: Some Clarification from therapy I Share for you. A Panic Attack happens because your Brain has a part which is called the Amygdala. This silly Part haha basically decides before you even can catch the thought if we are in danger or not. And with us it’s constantly in alert Mode and deciding danger. Basically run or fight for your life. It makes the wrong decision. Then the adrenaline rushes basically, and we feel all the Symptoms we feel. And the triggers for the amygdala to rush can be literally anything. To slow it down is our reaction to the Panic, Instead of reacting crazy thinking we need to rush for help. You stay with it. 5 minutes or hours. Doesn’t matter. To basically deload your Amygdala so it doesn’t have to send These false alarms to your Body!

I healed from it following exactly those things. And I wish someone told me all this when I was in the middle of my worst time of my life. So I had to Share it for you. I know It’ll help. Trust me. Reach out to the comments if any there is any open question!",1755514245.0,panicdisorder

1mt4sr3,cardio help?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been struggling with generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia for about five years. Lifting weights has been a struggle for me but im pushing through, and I’m currently trying to bulk and put on mass (so far i gained about 8kg in4 months). The problem is cardio.

Whenever I try cardio — whether it’s biking, walking stairs, attempting a run, or even just doing a leg day — my heart rate climbs high (170bpm+), and I start panicking. It feels like I’m about to pass out, so I usually stop. This makes it very hard to stay consistent with cardio, even though I know it’s important for overall health and recovery.

My question is:
	•	Are there good ways to ease into cardio without triggering so much fear?
	•	How can I balance doing enough cardio while still focusing on bulking and gaining mass? (other than calorie surplus)

I’d love to hear any tips from people who’ve been through something similar, or just general advice on how to not be terrified of cardio while still making progress in the gym.

1ms36se,Kolonopin for my anxiety?,"hello! in 2017 I very randomly developed a panic disorder this was diagnosed as GAD along with Agoraphobia, I have been mostly housebound for 6 years now with short periods of doing better. so far the medication and therapies iv received have been extensive, during this time a few things have helped like graded exposure therapy, beta blockers and CAT therapy. although I am still struggling and none have helped long term. sir's unfortunately do very little for me iv been on many since I was 13 and lexpro has been the only one that has had any helpful effect yet it is minimal 

my particular bat of anxiety is hard to treat due there being seemingly no cause, no particular fear and no idea what sets it off just.

  
I do not want to go back on beta blockers simply due to the fact they made my blood pressure very low and my heart rate too, sometimes my heart rate would drop to 40bpm and at night when sleeping even lower. it also felt like my body was straining to do more than the medication would allow it to. 

  
at this point I'm at a loss, I want to feel more normal and healthy I want to go out. has anyone used kolopin as a treatment for their anxiety disorder? did you find it helps? has anyone tried the treatment for several months and stopped? did it cause an anxiety relapse?

Nothing made a mental difference, some things helped me physically. I recently had a horrible two day spell of panic and anxiety and it traumatized me, I remember trying magnesium before and it didn’t do much, but there’s a catch, you have to get the magnesium that is easily absorbed (I’m no expert my friend who is a personal trainer told me) so I looked it up and started taking Chelated Magnesium Glycinate. I take the magnesium every morning and sometimes at night and it has made a world of difference, instead of my anxiety feeling like a stabbing mental pain now it is just a light poke, didn’t cure it of course but helps me a lot.

1mr792y,How do you guys keep jobs,"Hi there, new to the panic disorder family (lol). I’ve had them since forever but it only recently got really bad and I got diagnosed with a panic disorder/anxiety, because I keep fainting at work from panic attacks. It happened once and I got taken to the ER. Then a few days later, it almost happened again at work, but it was because I felt the same symptoms come back and panicked that I would faint, which led me to almost doing it again (lol). I went back to the ER. The job this happened to is a new job I’ve only had for two months now, and for a whole month out of these two months, I was on medical leave to try and find out why I keep fainting at work. Turns out it is my panic attacks getting out of control at work because of stress. My job is not even that stressful but now, I’m really scared to go back because I feel cursed, which isn’t helping. I seeked a therapist to learn coping mechanisms with no luck during my leave (canada health care am I right). I’m still waiting for a therapist but I have to go back to work in a week now.

1mr0jwr,Hospital for an attack,"I’ve had panic attacks since I was 12. I’m now 31 years old. I learned my panic attacks weren’t heart attacks by the time I was 13. I can breathe them away, I can make small steps to control my anxiety, I can go to therapy, I practice mindfulness, I exercise, I eat right. I’ve been medicated since I was 12. I’ve been in studies, I’ve gone to school for psychology. I built  life - destroyed it and rebuilt it many times due to panic attacks. I’ve tried so gd hard to cope, and the longest I’ve been able to go without is a few months, ever in my life. The earth shattering, no will to live through another one but knowing I have to and I have to and I have to for almost TWENTY FUCKING YEARS. I’ve been delusional, I’ve fought my way through it, I’ve been to the doctors countless times and countless times sent out with a new prescription and try to get counselling - try to change your brain and I have tried for TWENTY FUCKING YEARS. 

This feels nothing like a victory - this feels so pathetic and like the second the doctor walks I. I’m going to talk them out of taking me seriously. They will refer me and I’ll skip the appointments, or I’ll stick to it and I will eventually stop going or something will happen and it’ll be another lifetime before I get back to this place. Pointlessly suffering daily. There’s no point to my life. 

I was told “you did the right thing” and there’s nothing more that I believe than that I will quit and this will be another pointless reminder that it doesn’t matter and I’m stuck like this. 

But as I call into work after being warned that I can’t call into work anymore at a job I love, after the 50th time trying to talk to my beautiful new boyfriend that gets it and feeling like eventually this will lead to the end as he realizes that he doesn’t want to be a crutch, as my mom and sister are so fed up with me and my alcohol abuse while I try to make it work that their eyes go blank when I try to talk to them. As I lose all my friends because I can’t maintain the demand of relationships because 90% of the time I am too afraid to leave the house and the only thing that gets me out is the fact that I NEED TO FUCKING WORK TO SURVIVE. 

I am sitting here trying with all my might to stay seated in this hospital chair. Am I going to be doped up for the rest of my life? It feels like the only thing that would help is to have a person on my shoulder at all times to say calm tf down, that’s a stupid thought and a shock to my heart to get it to stop automatically racing and stopping me from breathing.

1mopfpt,Passing out reassurance,"I've struggled with panic attacks since 2021 but, as my previous post stated, I've been free of them for two years. I was always afraid of passing out or my heart exploding and it took me awhile to get over that. 

Today, I went with my gf so she could donate blood. I was fine until they sat her up, and I felt all awful tv static sensation all over my body that got worse until I took a knee and then passed out. Luckily I didn't hit my head very hard but it opened my eyes to the following;

1. Passing out, for me, was not super sudden and it gave me about a 30 second warning before I did. I totally could have pulled over if I was in a car or lay down if I was exercising. Thus, don't worry about magically passing out unless you have narcolepsy or some other condition that isn't related to vasovagal syncope. Worth noting that I've *almost* passed out in the past doing heavy squats but this is surprisingly common and still plenty of warning before it happened (I was smart enough to sit or lay down)

2. The sensation was similar to a panic attack in that it generally made me feel like my arms and legs were numb, but this one began in my head and traveled down. Other than that, pretty similar. It's comes on very fast and shortly lives. 

3. That I was fine. Passing out does not kill you, but falling can. Luckily I only hit my head a little and was fine afterwards. If you pass out, you're more likely than not to be okay. It's not a death sentence. 

4. That you will come out of it quickly (for most people). I was out for maybe a few seconds but it felt like hours. It took me around 30 mins to recuperate 

5. That you are highly unlikely to pass out from a panic attack. It will make you feel like you will, but the reality is that passing out is often due to a sudden surge of low blood pressure and heart rate. Anyone who's had an attack knows your pressure and heart rate is high. 

6. It wasn't that bad. This is the important one. It was embarrassing, but I would take fainting over panic attacks any day of the week. It dies off as quick as it comes. 


Tl;Dr you arent going to suddenly faint (for most people). At the time, it felt identical to a panic attack but as I reflect on it, it feels *different* and I can recognize it. Do not fight it nor a panic attack; simply let it happen and sit (lay down if possible) and let it pass. 

Hope someone needed this information

1momhfn,Anxiety destroyed me,"Anxiety completely destroyed me, and it's brilliant. It's the best thing that ever happened to me. Yes, you read that right, let me explain.

For years, I dreamt of being the child I was before anxiety appeared. I desperately wanted to go back to that ""paradise"" and escape the hell of panic attacks, derealization, and isolation. Today, I can finally say I've succeeded.

If I said anxiety destroyed me and that it was ""brilliant,"" it's because this condition forced me to push my limits. It made me adopt an impeccable lifestyle and be resourceful. But for us anxious people, it's not that difficult. If you're reading this, you're like me. And what is anxiety, really? It's ""overthinking."" Our brain is so powerful it becomes a handicap. You might be thinking: ""That's great, but I just want to live a normal life, I don't care about having a super brain."" It's possible, and I'm living proof.

Keep this idea in mind: An anxiety disorder is an imbalance in the body.
Any imbalance is corrected by habits that restore balance.
An impeccable lifestyle is the set of habits that restore balance.
Therefore, if you want to reduce your anxiety disorder, having an impeccable lifestyle is not an option, it’s a necessity.

Let me know in the comments if you'd be interested in the lifestyle tips that helped me!

1mhmha3,GP being unhelpful?,"Hey everyone,

So for context, I've been having panic attacks since around 11 y/o, and am 25 y/o by now. They used to be daily, but I've undergone CBT, EMDR, other therapies, and have been on Prozac since around 2017, with the occasional benzo for emergencies. After all of that, I usually have manageable levels of panic, but consistently every ~3-4 months I get a flare-up of a few days to a few weeks where I get a lot more panic attack, often multiple times a day, which results in temporary agoraphobia as well.

I recently had another one of these flare-ups come up. For almost 4 weeks I've been having multiple attacks a day, some small, some big. So, I'd decided I had enough and informed myself about some meds to switch to or try out to see how they affect me, as I feel there is still have a lot to improve on.

First, I discussed with my GP about buspirone. I realize this is not really standard for panic disorder, but it's been given to many people with PD with successful results regardless. Additionally, it can be started and stopped with reasonable ease, so there's not much risk involved. However, my GP responded with 
>""With all these arguments you're giving me I understand you want to try it. However, buspirone is sadly only prescribed for GAD with no co-occuring complications
Now, I don't think this is a medically sounds reason not to try it in the slightest, but okay, let's continue.

Next think I wanted to try was switching to Effexor, as it's approved for panic disorder and I wanted to see if I respond to an SNRI better than an SSRI. Again, she said no, this time because
>""Effexor is not recommended by our practice, in part because it's harder to quit""
Now, I think this is at least a slightly more thought through reason, but then again, why does the medication exist if you can't even start it because it's hard to stop? 

Then, as the finishing touch, I go to the mental health specialist that's contracted at the GP's office to talk about a referral to therapy. She says
>""Yes I'll put you on the list for practice, but the waiting lists are about 17 weeks and there's only about a 50/50 percent chance you'll actually get accepted""
Sure, sad but that's out of her control. At this point though, I drop that I'm a bit frustrated with the GP's choices so far, resulting in *her* getting irritated at *me*, calling me impatient, saying I'm grasping at straws, and ending in saying that I should just be patient and wait out the therapists waiting list as they can help me better. As a reminder, this will be *17 weeks with a 50/50 chance of even getting accepted*. Meanwhile I've been having daily panic attacks for weeks.

Is this okay behaviour? Am I just desperate for anything? I'm genuinely struggling because I feel so frustrated with them, but at the same time I have such an urge to try to empathize with them. But I feel like my body is just not mine and I have no autonomy to speak of. I wish I could just take things into my own hands because these people don't feel like they're capable of helping me. In fact, the mental health expert even insisted buspirone is an SSRI (it's not) and that cross-tapering isn't a thing (it is). How can they expect me to trust them like this...",1754334190.0,panicdisorder
1mh7ayp,Panic attack fr 3 mnths,"I just wonder if anyone can help or has any words of advice. 

To cut a very long story short. I have had panic attacks since I can recall. Age 6 the memory starts and I’m now 36. I had a car crash in march which pushed my panic attack frequency into overdrive. I’ve had three weeks off work signed off. I was starting to get better and went back to work. I’m still not 100% at this point. This past weekend I went to a museum with my dad and stepmum. Our relationship has never been great but I try my hardest to stay close because I love him. Despite my step mums manipulative and underhand ways of causing any issue she can between us. He loves her and she isn’t going anywhere. She asked who is walking me down the aisle. I have already told him seperately it’ll be him and stepdad. 

Then he announces to me by text afterwards he isn’t happy walking down the aisle in my wedding with my stepdad in November with me and I have to choose. My stepdad has never been rude to him my dad just hates him and my mum. He claimed I never ran it by him and I know I have. My stepmum clearly told him she thinks it’s out of order in the car on the way home.

They had a nasty divorce when I was 2 and my stepdad met my mum and raised me like his own since I was 3. I’ve asked my brother to talk to him and see if he can show him he’s being selfish. If that doesn’t work I don’t know if I should cut him out as he has been a huge cause of many of my panic attacks and traumas. 

I’ve woken up crying or with pins and needles in my arms and legs for the past 3 months due to the panic and this most recent event has really set me back. I’ve spent all weekend crying and panicking. 

I am on 75mg of venlaflaxine daily, beta blockers 40mg daily, have had CBT, talking therapy in the past. I have occasional Valium and sleeping pills when I need them.

So, I’ve been dealing with a panic disorder I think most of my life (I’m 18 now). 

I always reacted to stuff physically and mentally, but it really started to get noticeably worse as I turned 12-13. 

At 12-13 it started to go worse and worse and throughout the years up until my current age, it has gotten worse and the symptoms have gotten stronger. 

My symptoms are: Feeling tingly in my face and in my arms, stomach issues, vomiting, nausea, cold sweat, feeling like passing out, heart starts beating faster AND I really feel very very afraid. 

As you can see, my symptoms are mostly physical, but it still is also mental even if its not in such a big role. 

I think my panic attacks start mentally, and then it hits me like a truck physically.

So my question is: does anyone else feel their panic attacks this strongly, and how are you guys coping with them? Its really taking control of my life.

I developed panic disorder around 4 months ago (I’d had maybe 3 or 4 panic attacks before that point but many years apart) where I couldn’t go outside without severe depersonalisation and panic attacks, and my nervous system was screaming at me constantly even when in a “safe” environment.

Since then I’ve had to quit work and have been undergoing therapy. Compared to the beginning, exposure therapy has definitely done something - I’ve been able to meet friends, go on long trains, restaurants etc. The problem is, I’m never actually happy/relaxed doing any of this. I did scary things without panicking, but for 4 months my brain/mood has been telling me somethings wrong 24/7. I constantly ruminate about the fact I’ve developed this disorder - I literally think about it constantly - which has led to periods of really bad depression.

My two main problems are that I’m still very scared of having panic attacks (especially around other people), and that I obsess and ruminate over the state of my life and the poor quality of my mental health.

1mfigxz,Weirdest Symptoms!,"Is it just me? Or has anyone else experienced something like this?

Last night, I was still awake around 4 AM. I felt completely fine—no worry, no anxiety. But as soon as I decided to sleep, I suddenly noticed my heart pounding really hard. It was so intense that I could feel my pulse in my throat and even in my back. It started gradually, then kept getting faster and faster. I think my heart rate hit around 120 bpm. It lasted for about 20 minutes and then went away.

I have health anxiety and GAD, and I’ve been dealing with panic and anxiety attacks, which I’ve learned to manage over time. But what happened last night felt so different. There was no fear. No adrenaline rush. No sense of doom. No shortness of breath or the usual symptoms I get during anxiety episodes. It was just my heart pounding rapidly—and now I'm anxious just thinking about what that was.

I even started wondering if it was triggered by the bread or chips I ate an hour before going to bed.

Also, over the past couple of weeks, I’ve been getting this strange “impending doom” feeling—it’s like a heavy sense of fear stuck in the center of my chest or stomach. But it doesn’t come with any physical symptoms. My heart rate stays normal, no pounding, no other signs.

My sister, who’s a nurse, told me it’s almost impossible for me to suddenly develop a heart problem in just two years—especially since in 2023 I had countless ER visits at different hospitals. I had several ECGs, 2D ECHOs, and EKGs done.

She also reminded me that heart problems usually show up during physical activity, which I haven’t experienced. I can still jog and dance for 20 to 45 minutes, and even do ab workouts at home without feeling any chest pain or symptoms that would point to a heart issue.",1754112033.0,panicdisorder
1mf3xbe,This shit is so crazy,"I made a post last week about how I am experiencing panic disorder all over again, after not having dealt with it for some years. Anyways, my worst fears definitely did come true and I did, in fact, wind up right back in the loop. 

Actually managed to get things somewhat under control after my first attack, got some sleep, went back to the gym, etc. But throughout that process, I simply have not been able to shake the feeling that something is off with me. 

That uneasy, “on edge” feeling, cumulated in me experiencing another full fledge panic attack which led me to stay awake for 3 nights straight. Anytime I would start to get slightly relaxed, my body would just jerk me back awake. By the 3rd night of no sleep, I was on the brink of losing my shit, so I caved and went to the ER. Thankfully the hospital was great, reassured me it was just anxiety, and gave me a short term script of Xanax (absolute lifesaver). 

I honestly never knew anxiety could be *this bad*. It legitimately feels like I have just been injecting caffeine into my veins or like I am on some type of stimulant. 

I tried to sit with all the anxious energy for 5 hours last night, eye closed, deep steady breaths, all that jazz. I managed to significantly lower my heart rate, but I still had so much of an uneasy feeling that I had to cave at 6AM last night and take a Xanax to pass out. 

I know my nervous system must just be highly over-sensitized at the moment, but holy shit, this last week has legitimately made me feel like I was on the verge of going mad. 

Anyone else going through something similar? These forms have definitely been helping me to realize that I am not alone in this, without that, I would think something was seriously wrong with me.

1mcugv3,How I beat panic attacks,"Hey everyone! Been a long time lurker of this thread but wanted to share a success with you. 

As of 2 months ago, I haven't had a panic attack in 2 years. Many people ask me how I managed to do this without SSRI's (although, these were tempting). I still took medicine but I'll get into that in a moment. 

My first attack happened on my way home from a job. I just had my first daughter a few months ago and it felt like I was dying; hyperventilating, heart pounding, hands and feet went numb, etc. My doctor, knowing my history with anxiety kind of laughed at it and said he's surprised I hadn't had one before. 

Quickly I spiraled. I lost my job, and my relationship with my now ex suffered greatly. I was afraid to leave the house and became agoraphobic. The idea of having another panic attack scared me so bad that I could not live. At some point, the fear started to piss me off that I was letting my life flash before my eyes without doing anything so I began my journey towards feeling better. 

The first step to me getting better was quitting caffeine and nicotine. No ifs, ands, or buts. I avoided all stimulants like it was the plague. My doctor was very impressed that I managed to quit both in the same week, but it was very hard and I was unemployed so it made it a little easier in that regard. 

The next step was having somewhat of an unfair advantage; my brother is a psychotherapist. He recommended me ""when panic attacks"" by Dr. David Burns and it became my Bible for the better part of a year. 

There, I learned the ABCs of psychotherapy. 

A means antecedents. In this context, what situation or environment leads up to the anxiety 

B is belief. This is our understanding of it and our fears. ""What if X happens?"" Or ""I will be hurt or killed""

C is consequence, or the result of the two prior. This is the anxiety and panic that manifests within us. 

So, 

If we treated A, it would mean to avoid situations or actions that would make us anxious in the first place. This lead me to being agoraphobic. 

If we treated C, we only treat the consequences. This is usually in the form of medication to essentially mask or hide the anxiety. 

B is the logical answer to treat, because we can certainly change our beliefs about things. 

From there, I set myself upon a cognitive behavioral journey. I put myself in very light and controlled situations that would make me anxious (akin to sticking your toes in the water to feel the temperature) and worked my way up. Slowly but surely, the same drive to Walmart 10 mins from my house that used to scare me and send me into attacks became relaxation time to just be away from home. 

The idea is to expose yourself to your fears and if you do it enough, your brain *will* eventually recognize there is nothing to fear. Hence, we change the beliefs we have about that certain situation, action, or environment. 

However, to say medication did not help me would be lying. I take vistaril everyday to help me sleep, because my mind races at night. In addition, a stronger medication as a rescue pill in case I find myself in an attack that I cannot escape. The rescue pill in particular helped encourage me to try new things and relearn my brain and it's beliefs, because one of my biggest fears was having a panic attack I would never come out of. For this reason alone, I recommend enlisting the help (or resources) of both psychotherapists and psychiatrists for the best of both worlds. 

Moving on, I stand before you 4 years since my first attack and I've been free of them for 2. Eventually, you will find peace and solace but you have to work for it. Medication is a great things, but for those of you who still stuffer or are scared of medicine, just know that there are other options to help you. 

Some miscellaneous tips: 

-keep sour candy with you. Sour stuff will help cut anxiety and panic by doing some funky stimulation to your brain. 

-you can help an attack by placing something like ice or cold water on your back or the back of your head. 

-dont fight the attacks, let that happen. Panic attacks are adrenaline and they cannot kill you. Let it wear itself out. 

-dont feel embarrassed. Let people know you are having one. Almost everyone has had an attack or knows someone who does, and 99% of those I encountered are very sympathetic and helpful when I told them what was going on. 

-dont sit around and dwell on it. I did this and I didn't get better for a long time. Try to live your life and see the attacks as an inconvenience, not a lifestyle 

Hope this helps some of you. ",1753841404.0,panicdisorder

1mcmgd0,Zoloft Success,"My Zoloft/Sertraline Success Story

I want to start by saying that I know how many of you are feeling when starting Zoloft (sertraline). I am a 24-year-old female, and when I started, I was so scared. My doctor didn’t give me much information before I dove in, and I felt like I was walking into the unknown.

The first three days felt fine and then it hit me. For about six days, I was nauseous, sad, and didn’t want to eat or leave my room. I felt discouraged, let down, and I wanted to give up. Like many people, I turned to Reddit, and reading horror stories only made me feel worse.

One thing changed everything. I talked to my godmother, who struggles with anxiety and depression like I do. She told me, “Don’t give up.” As hard as it was, I listened to her. By the time I hit the two-week mark, I felt 100 times better. I still had my moments, but overall, things were improving.

Six months in, my life looked completely different. I could socialize without panicking, I wasn’t exhausted all the time, and I finally felt like myself again. My biggest fears like planes, social events, long car rides, work, and school started to feel manageable.

Now, at one year on Zoloft (100mg), I can honestly say I’m a different person. I fly to visit my brother in another state at least once a month. I adopted a cat. I moved out with my boyfriend. I go to concerts, grocery stores, and even travel solo. I started a new job.

Zoloft also changed my relationship with my boyfriend. We have been together for seven years, and even though he is incredibly understanding, my anxiety put a strain on us. Now, I can enjoy life with him without constant panic attacks ruining our plans.

I just want everyone to know that it absolutely gets better. Everyone’s experience is different, but my biggest advice is to start slow. If possible, begin with half the prescribed dose and increase it every five days. It makes the transition so much easier on your body and mind.

A year ago, I never would have had the confidence to write something like this, but here I am. I lost so many years of my life to anxiety and fear, but I am finally living again, and I am so grateful I stuck with it

when i stopped smoking vapes i continued with smoking weed because i was worried i'd couldnt sleep. i stopped smoking weed after my first panic attack. i also stopped drinking alcohol with one exception in march. 

ever since i built up as i would say a ""solid to healthy lifestyle"":

i lost 25-30kg, as said before no more vapes weed and alcohol, i eat a lot healthier, do some cicling every day and nowadays i try to lift 1-3 times a week.

now, around half an year without vapes, i honestly thought for a couple of days that i'm free. my last big panic attack was around 2 months ago and still i get those anxiety peaks. as i did today.

i were just laying around on the couch when i stood up and instantly felt some weird pain in my right arm, i know that was the trigger of my last panic attack so i knew ""ah, thats alright"" but when i went upstairs to do my training, it got worse and worse.

1mc5gml,Bit of a relapse,"Hey guys, I’ve had a hellish past 2.5 years.  Two summers ago it got to its worst when I started having panic attacks countless times in any given day.

A lot of time and effort later, about 1.5 years and countless breakdowns, therapy, meds, and an intensive outpatient program, I was finally managing.  My biggest trigger was and still is sleep.  Mainly not getting enough, real or perceived.

Unfortunately, as the title says, I relapsed about a month ago and have been having trouble sleeping since.  Good days and bad days.

I am writing this because I had an intense feeling that, although it’s recurring it is still brief, that I was doomed and broken and a burden.

I know logically that it will get better, but my hormones strongly disagree.  I start adult work in 2 weeks and it’s adding a lot of stress.

I don’t know how to end this, but I’ll be back.  Thanks in advance, although I know I didn’t give that much to get advice for.",1753775712.0,panicdisorder

1mbu2hi,Please help.,"Been in a state of hyperarousal for 3 months due to severe anxiety having all these intrusive OCD thoughts that there is something medically and mentally wrong. Its gotten to a point where its caused chronic insomnia yet feel wide awake all day, and whenever I get real tired its perceived as a threat as is sleep as I get massive panic attacks. I've been inpatient and now outpatient and still trapped. I get massive long lasting panic attacks all day, am on multiple meds.

The fear of being tired happens automatically when I feel tired and get thoughts like am I going to collapse, am I going to die, am I going to knock over or break a device again. As I passed out one night and my Nintendo Switch was on the floor and I'm the type to drop devices. I have been losing memory of when I sleep the last few weeks and most of the night but wake up shortly and can't get back to sleep due to the panic attack.

The outpatient wants to move me to a exposure part of their program as soon as a spots ready, I get waken up by jolts of panic/anxiety any time I try to sleep. Is there anyway to reprogram my thinking on this and to expose myself? I don't want this to go on any longer, been the worst suffering of my life its been a horrendous past 3 months. I'm very sensitive to bodily sensations so feeling tired or relaxed is an automatic anxiety trigger when I wish it weren't any longer. Idk if this can naturally end on its own or be stuck permanently I'm terrified.",1753740751.0,panicdisorder
1mbrshi,wtf is going on?,ok so recently towards the end of classes out of the blue i had a severe panic attack during school. i had never had anxiety or panic attacks before and i genuinely thought i was going to die. ever since then they started reoccurring and now i have them daily. i havent been diagnosed with anything because i havent talked to my parents about it but they know something is up because ive already had 3 in public with them. but ive been experiencing symptoms like dissociation and a racing heartbeat without the actual panic and its every day without fail. is that just general anxiety or is it panic disorder? it doesnt always develop into a full blown panic attack but sometimes it does and im just so confused. is this a common situation for others who get panic attacks please let me know. and if so what is it.,1753735382.0,panicdisorder

1mac340,How do you distinguish?,"I’ve already made a post today talking about the panic attack I had today. Same time as it always is but it’s still a scary experience, this time I had a really bad chest cramp in my lower left side when breathing but it faded a bit. Came about while laying down as I got that fight or flight feeling once laying down. I’d like to remind anyone that I’ve had a blood test an ekg and I’m only 16. Don’t really have family history of any heart issues either so I’ve mostly ruled it out but I’m still kind of struggling. I’ve listened to countless videos about it and have been recommended a podcasts but to be honest this subreddit is just the best way for me to get a good clear response from people who have possibly experienced this for longer and understand more deeply about PD. I know that I should be getting therapy but to be honest, this and my parents are my only real line of connecting to dots and easing my way out of a panic attack besides trying to go to sleep. I do have a physiatrist thing Tuesday, alongside a tele-health but as of now the best thing I can do is try riding through my panic attacks. The biggest issue and worry I’m kind of facing right now is disguising when your body is in fight or flight compared to a full blown panic attack. For me I always notice a build up around 8-10pm and it slowly releases later into the night. I’m still having daily chest tightness and maybe some dull aches but it’s kinda easier to cope with now that I’ve had this same symptom for 9-10 weeks by now. I know panic attacks last 10-20 minutes but I’ve seen them last way longer and it concerns me. But to be fair my everyday life at this point concerns me. I wake up and the tightness comes along sometime after, play some games to distract myself,eat, maybe go on a run or do some exercises at home since it’s pretty hot out and then it usually comes along once it hit that time. I understand I’m stuck in a loop from all the stuff I’ve read but it’s gotten bad enough where I start using AI to ask my what if’s about whether I’m having some unknown heart issue! I know it’s horrible for me to do that but it’s so hard to resist when it feels so real. I don’t no where else or what else to do to reassure myself and to calm my self down as I struggle with breathing, it becomes shallow and it’s even harder to ground myself.

I’m being successfully treated for seizures which is good, but the fear of passing out has stopped me from living my life for a while now. 

For example, I fear going places I don’t know. I struggle with going into restaurants in case I’m seated in the middle of the room surrounded by other tables. Any semblance of feeling like passing out will send me into a panic. 

I also struggle with driving on highways bc I’m afraid I will pass out. It’s made me feel a lack of independence that I so desire in my life.

1m9e5f7,How do this just start?,"I've been on here a couple times now but It might be best that I ask about similar experiences possibly. It's about to be 2 and a half months since this started for me which is surprising, I wasn't expecting time to blow by so fast with it but I guess when you feel constant dread and fear, and the only thing you can do is play games, maybe go for a run, and sleep then I guess it explains it a little. It really has been hard for me since the start, and I still struggle with the horrid symptoms daily. I've gone to the doctors twice, gotten an ecg/ekg, blood tests, and gone to a physiatrist. All of them came back normal besides low vitamin D, I thought that'd take the stress off and maybe It'd just, ""go away"" but unfortunately that's not how panic disorders work do they? I go to a new physiatrist and have a tele-health check next Tuesday so hopefully that can help me continue to work through this horrible mental state that I've been going through for what feels like forever. Unlike some people here I haven't really mastered how to deal with my panic disorder after I got diagnosed with it, I'm trying to but it's hard without professional help which I suggest to anyone struggling with any sort of anxiety disorder whether diagnosed or questioning whether to get a diagnosis. But regardless, I want to ask whether anyone else had a similar first experience or if it matched up symptoms wise. My first panic attack was in late-ish May, I'm 16 and was a sophomore at the time in high school. I just finished my AP tests a week before and almost had to walk home in the rain after an environmental because the AP testers thought it was a great idea to only form whether you needed to get a ride if you took bus which I didn't have any proper accommodations for. I luckily made it home through one of my sister's friends and just kind of slept the day off. I pretty much just forgot about it after then but about a week later during health class during a CPR demonstration thingy, I was hit with a powerful sensation, almost like I was about to pass out all of a sudden and I thought my sugar was off. I didn't eat anything that same morning besides drinking a glass of chocolate milk, I rushed to my lunch box in order to grab some cookies and I started eating them to see if it helped but I still felt that rush of feelings. I positioned myself in a way that I maybe felt a little better by leaning downwards which helped a bit but the feeling was just so overwhelming. Of course, it didnt help the CPR instructor forced me to get down and ""participate"" and I still felt incredibly shaky and WAS incredibly shaky, im surprised that she as a school nurse didnt notice a thing wrong with me because I was told by a friend near me whether I was feeling ok. After the CPR thingy and the nurse left I asked the substitute teacher to go to the nurse and he let me. I went to the clinic and she said my blood pressure was a little high and that I just needed to breath. It's kind of blurry now as my memory isnt great for a teenager but I dont remember it being or feeling like a panic attack maybe. At the time of course I thought we were having a heart attack because health class was teaching that sort of stuff near the end of the year so it probably didn't help my case. I got my mom to pick me up, she got me Wendys, and we went home afterwards. She went back out and I just chilled on the couch until the feeling went away. It did for the rest of the day, it confuses me so much thinking about it now as the days following, I just felt this feeling of anxiety and adrenaline almost coursing through me until a couple days after, I had my first panic attack. At the time I was still really worried it was some heart issue and that fear lasted all the way till I got an ECG and Blood test which only slightly helped my conscious but I think Im finally coming to accept that it truly is a panic disorder and nothing wrong with my test, I might ask for a CT scan or some other tests possibly as I mean maybe itll help a little further but im still pretty convinced now it is panic. I don't know what I'm asking for with this post entirely but, maybe someone has an answer or a similar story.",1753485754.0,panicdisorder

1m8rqgg,Constant chest pain,"19 y/o male, I have horrible chest tightness that has been going on for about 3 years now. For context I have always done heavy weightlifting and am generally on the skinnier side with some muscle. This all technically started after I had a horrible panic attack from a weed edible I took which had my left chest contracting and squeezing itself, alongside my heart rate being around 170bpm, blood pressure through the sky and going to the ER. After that my left side chest never felt the same. I continued weight lifting and also taking long breaks but nothing has gotten rid of my CONSTANT chest pain that I have from waking up to going to bed 24/7 for roughly 2-3 years. I would try smoking again but it would instantly give me the same reaction of heart racing and squeezing. (Used to smoke weed for 3 years without any problems).

I have chest tightness that I thought was costochondritis but after rolling my back with a lacrosse ball for weeks, using the backpod, and taking months from weightlifting, I have lost hope in what it is. My blood pressure sometimes sky rockets when I'm in immense pain but is mostly normal 130's/80's and I've seen lower numbers but honestly I think the constant pain I'm in raises it. I eat healthy and maybe not enough but I cant for the life of me and researching find how to fix this. I ALSO THINK MY LEFT FOREARM VEINS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PROMINENT AT REST which scares me that I have some sort of vascular issue but no doctor has said anything and or I may have not mentioned it.

I have had the most extensive workup which has included:

Cardiology: (Echocardiogram, Stress Test, EKG's, Ultrasounds, Holter Monitor for a week)

Pulmonology: (X-ray, lung capacity tests, everything looked healthy)

GI: (Endoscopy, found mild gastritis which I took several different meds for, didn't help)

Neurology: (Nerve conduction test, MRI of Cervical and Thoracic, found nothing apparently. Suspect Thoracic Outlet Syndrome)

Psychiatrist: (in the chance it was all anxiety I tried Klonopin which helps temporarily but doesn't get rid of the pain fully just numbs me out, I don't feel like its anxiety because my pain is constant when I'm not anxious or stressed)

My pain was so bad that when I started college last fall I ended up going to the ER 8 different times because my chest pain that was constantly there and would flare into a sort of panic attack that would have my heart racing 160 bpm+ with squeezing pain. They found nothing heart related and told me that it was anxiety. I ended up dropping out and taking a gap semester in which I have tried relentlessly to get this pain to go away. After coming home I had a fewer panic attacks and went to the ER again a few times but it has now been 6 months since I've had one of those horrible episodes.

I currently have constant chest tightness in the left side, sternum pressure, chest popping cracking throughout my sternum, chest and collarbone, collarbone tightness, and horrible neck tightness. I just want my life back and to be pain free, as every doctor has told me that im a mystery. There was a time not long ago that I was pain free working out weightlifting and having the time of my life.

This pain is debilitating and It prevents me from doing everything I want to do, literally everything is prevented I have a hard time just leaving the house now. And when my buddies want to go out for a drink now instead of being excited im left feeling sad because I CAN NO LONGER ENJOY NORMAL LIFE.

This sucks someone please help steer me in the right direction as im starting at a new college next month to get my life on with but Im in constant pain.",1753424309.0,panicdisorder
1m8hx3c,meds that actually work??,"so i was on ativan (1mg a day) for my panic disorder and ptsd. i have at least one panic attack a day, sometimes multiple, ive also had them in my sleep many times and i have them every time i wake up. but my new psychaitrist basically called me an addict ""1mg a day is a LOT"" and said she wouldnt put me on benzos, even after i tried to clarify that all the other dumbass meds she brought up DO NOT WORK (propranolol and vistiril... literally sugar pills) and that my panic attacks get so severe that i literally cannot stop them without my ativan. my most recent severe panic attack ended with me giving myself a 3rd degree burn because i could not stop the shaking and crying and sweating. so now im not seeing her anymore. thanks for nothing. im gonna see an actual doctor and see if they can prescribe me my ativan but i dont really want to be on an as needed medication, i want to be on one that like stays in my system so i dont have to wake up panicking anymore. plus benzos come with their own cons, like rebound anxiety.

is there any meds that actually fucking work though? because ive been on so many meds that just straight up do nothing and im so sick of the trial and error. ativan is the only one ive been on thats done anything. i even stopped taking my adhd meds because ive been trying to avoid excess panic/anxiety.",1753395104.0,panicdisorder

I chewed a Benadryl and it made my mouth and throat go numb and that absolutely sent me off the rails.

1m7b6oq,Morning panic attacks,"So my main trigger seems to be breakfast. Usually, I'd say 70% of mornings, I'll wake up okay, and my heart rate is normal. But after breakfast, 90% of the time, my heart rate will be elevated and sensitive to movement, pounding harder, and I'll feel light headed a bit. This has been happening for years, and it doesn't matter what I eat. It can happen with other meals as well but generally just breakfast. I have gone to a cardiologist and got an EKG and a week long holter monitor and they were clear of anything bad, and they are doing an echocardiogram mostly for my peace of mind. But they don't seem concerned. Outside of post breakfast, I don't typically have panic attacks. And I can go weeks where I won't let it bother me. But then sometimes it'll be debilitating where I can't leave the house until the afternoon because I'm afraid of my heart rate spiking. 

An example of what may happen: a few days ago, I had breakfast. 30 mins later, my hr was a bit elevated like usual, but this time it was particularly bad and bothering me a lot. Well I went for a drive, and once I got back home, I was feeling highly anxious. I knew my hr would spike standing up out of the car, and I was anticipating it. It spiked to 170 on the way inside and I had to lay down and calm down. But literally within a minute or two of laying down, I was able to walk around the house again with my hr being 100 or less.

1m75uxu,3 years of PD,"Even though I have gotten ""better"" during this years compared to when I became agoraphobic right before starting my senior year in highschool, I still deal with some stuff that got me a little depressed honestly I'ma try to simplify everything in the next paragraph and honestly I'm just doing this to let a little out of my chest since Idk what to do at this point.

I developed PD after a bad trip because of smoking marijuana most likely laced after 3 months of having random panic attacks that I didn't know what they were i got to a point where I quit my job and just stayed home. After a couple weeks I got covid and after visiting the ER and recovering that's when I developed agoraphobia that lasted about 6-7 months until I had to just face reality and go to highschool which became impossible bc of the anxiety so that's why after a month of dealing with horrible anxiety and not being able to stay in class I went on meds specifically Paxil,  and got my ""life"" back then fast forward got a gf, party hard, got my license did a lot of things and after a year and a couple of months of using Paxil then it started giving me bad side effects so I went sober by my own way in 2-3 weeks going from 20-15-10-5-0 and since then I've been sober.

Now 3 years later I still deal with 3 specific side effects. Bad hunger every 4-5 hours, Extremely dry mouth, insomnia and a little bit of heat intolerance at this point people have told me to go back on Paxil and go off of it properly because that might ""resolve"" the long lasting side effects other people have advice me to go on meds again which I want to but since meds can cause even more side effects I fear that might cause me to lose my job and so here I am sleeping at 4-5am everyday taking magnesium or melatonin everyday because I can't sleep without it, always going out in public with a bottle water is embarrassing at this point that I go to the restroom with a bottle of water because when the thirst strike it makes me go panic mode and eating every 4 hours which fortunately haven't caused weight gain but it's really inconvenient because when I don't eat my hunger makes me dizzy and panicky I just want to ask you guys if anyone in here everyday's life sounds like mine because even though I ""function"" i fucking feel like a failure

1m6a9h7,What are Somatic Tools?,"**You didn’t fail CBT. Your body just needs to be part of the plan.**

Anxiety isn’t just racing thoughts.  It’s also jaw tension, shoulder bracing, stomach flips, shaky legs…the body prepping for a threat that never quite arrives. That’s why somatic therapy matters. It speaks the body’s language, instead of telling your system it’s safe, it **shows** it, repeatedly. **This isn’t about being calm, it’s about having range.** To feel the activation of tension without being ruled by it by having control.  Here are a few examples to try:

* Press your hands into a wall. Let your muscles tremble. Then stop. That’s teaching your system: “I can ramp up and come down.”
* Track sensations. Tight jaw, hot face, chest pressure… without assigning meaning. You’re observing it, not decoding it.
* Sway side to side. Shift your weight, your left foot, then right foot. Tiny movements build flexibility and flexibility lowers panic.

It’s not magic, it’s mechanics, and over time, your system starts to trust that safety is a repeatable state and not just a fluke. Somatic work isn’t a replacement for therapy. But for a lot of people, it’s the missing half of the equation.",1753179299.0,panicdisorder

i was wondering if anyone wanted to share their stories on their first panic attack and if you know what caused it, if you had any warning etc…. 

i was in hospital with a broken ankle when i had my first proper one about 3 months ago…. one minute i was fine, having a cup of tea and reading a book, waiting to hear back from the nurses about what day my surgery would be, i had pain relief, i was quite relaxed…. the next minute in the flick of a switch i couldn’t feel my hands feet or face, it felt like someone was stood on my chest, my face was numb, my muscles locked and i couldn’t move my hands and they turned into claws from my muscles contracting, obviously insane heart rate… it was the scariest thing i’ve ever felt and now here i am with full blown panic disorder!

1m5pcrg,What just happened to me?,"I was visiting a friend's house last night to care for their dogs while they're away. I've done this many times for them over several years. I don't drive at the moment due to medical issues. My husband drove me, and typically there is parking down the street but this week there hasn't been, so he'll sit right out front with his four-ways on, to wait for my call that I'm on my way out to the car. It isn't a great area, it's 10pm, completely dark out and I'm visually impaired (plus Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia and GAD with OCD tendencies [not new diagnoses], and a couple weeks in to adjusting to an SSRI - Zoloft - for the first time).

I got done with the dogs and called him and he didn't answer. That never happens so I waited a couple mins and called again. No answer. So I looked outside and his car wasn't there. And I began panicking badly. Tried to focus and finish up the few things I needed to do before locking up, but I could feel the ""ohmygodohmygod"" rising within me. Initially I thought maybe he had just fallen asleep in the car, but when I realized the car wasn't there, my thoughts began to race and I thought, basically in this order - 
""Omg maybe he got mad and left""
""Maybe he had an emergency! I hope he's okay!""
""Maybe he left me!""
""Maybe he kld himself""
""Maybe I drove myself and imagined that he drove me?""
""Then where did I leave my car?!""
""Am I losing my mind?!""
""Is any of this real?""
""I'll have to call someone to come get me""
""I'm going to have a panic attack""
""I'm going to have to take an Ativan to make it through this""
""Should I call 911? Will they bring me home?""
""I don't remember driving! I KNOW he drove.""
<panic intensifies as I lock up and decide to walk down the sidewalk to see if I can spot the car in the dark, still trying to call him but no answer, and realizing that I'm hyperventilating. I don't see any car with lights on.>
""What if he was never actually with me at all?"" ""What if I imagined him?""
""What if we never got married and this has all been in my imagination, and I have been driving this whole time?""
""Is any of this real?"" <second time for this scary af thought

At this point, I find the car. He found a place to park slightly behind another vehicle which is why I couldn't see any lights (also, my janky eyeballs). He was playing a full screen game on his phone, never saw it ringing. I tell him how scared I was, he reassures me. We head home. The entire ride home, I'm trying to calm down and internally questioning wtf is wrong with me and if I'm losing my damn mind. He must have realized I was zoned out because he held my hand, and I just wanted to freaking cry. It took me until 10 minutes after getting home to calm down and realize I'm safe, my husband is real (😂😭), I'm okay. For context.... we've been together for 13 years.

So wtf was that? Derealization? Just regular panic? That's never happened to me before - thinking for a minute that I might have just imagined an entire person and past history... because I couldn't find our car?

It has been SO hard trying to adjust to this new med. I'm just over a month in, I no longer know what is my anxiety and what are side effects. Every time I think I'm doing well, I spend half the day battling intrusive thoughts or ideation, or whatever this was today, questioning my own reality or convincing myself I'm losing my mind, waking up out of nightmares, etc. My Psych knows all of this, my therapists too, my husband, my family, my support system. Everyone says I'm doing great with the med and could increase it if I wanted, making good progress with my anxiety, etc, but this sure doesn't feel like it. I was totally derailed by something that wouldn't have bothered me a couple months ago. I have walked down that same sidewalk to the car in light and dark for YEARS.

1m5klm8,On edge feeling,"Hi everyone,
I'm about to start week 10 50mg on Sertraline for my panic disorder that started early May

Haven't had a panic attack for a while now. The only time I've had a full panic attack on Sertraline was 2-3 weeks ago on the day of moving when I was helping lift things and had a mini panic attack that lasted like 30 seconds (due to physical symptoms, which was good exposure now that I think about it)

 I have moved twice since I've had PD (not by choice). Was wondering for the people who have 'recovered' from panic disorder with Sertraline, when did the residual anxiety fade away? All I'm really feeling is the strong on edge feeling in my stomach and chest that is pretty high. I have some good points where it's dulled but overall it's still fairly high.

I'm doing CBT and exposure therapy and that's going well, just wondering when this unnatural lingering anxiousness goes away, I am going to stick with 50mg for at least 16 weeks before I think of increasing

First, I was in a restaurant with my parents, celebrating my good year at college, after a meal i went out to light a cig, sudden flash of hottnes, heart palpitations, sweat, dizziness hit me like a train. I knew to have those sensations and i just went home to take a nap, i was fine after it and even went out with my friends.

The next day, I felt completely off, kinda sick but i still went to work and there i had the worst panic attack ever. I started sweating, got a racing heart, dizziness, shaky legs, everything you can name. I called a taxi to pick me up, when i came home my BP was 140/90, and I was not feeling better in the next few hours, I felt worse. I went to the ER, vomited in my car due to anxiety of going to a doctor, when i came there my BP was 160/90 but just by sitting there and being in an safe invironment i felt much better, they gave me 1 anti anxiety pill  (they also prescribed me 5mg of those pills) and i did al the bloodwork + ekg, everything was normal, even my BP was normal again.

I tought that was the end of it but my symptoms stayed, still a racing heartbeat, still urge to vomit, still globus sensation, still sweating. I tought it will end when i came to my holiday house and it did get better but only in my house, when i have to go somewhere all those symptoms come back, I just feel afwul and miserable because i can't do regular day things due to anxiety.

1m0rcmj,When did your PD start?,"Hi! My panic disorder started in 2020 immediately after a DUI in which I crashed my car into a pole. No one else was in the car, or involved in the accident. I was borrowing a project car of my dad’s while I was car shopping after a blown engine. I had never been grounded. I was a straight A student. Never had a detention. Cried over every stern talking to. Didn’t have a great childhood but who did? That night I tried to fight police, they called my dad, and when he showed up I let out everything that had been inside of me for 20 years. The next day, I took my first panic attack, I assumed it was just post crash problems pain in my head and chest from the airbag, maybe a concussion, but I felt like I was going to die. Since then, I’ve taken panic attacks every day, some manageable some not. It took a year until I hospitalized myself though I had been going to the ER almost daily for feeling like I was having a heart attack. I did okay for a bit after the hospitalization I was still able to drive and do things. Then I moved far away and had a baby. A few months post partum my anxiety spiked, a lot of derealization. Hospitalized again. Did okay for another 8-10 months, but got divorced moved back to my home state, and became a single mom, worked warehouse jobs. Eventually things got bad again, but so much worse than ever before couldn’t drive, scared to shower, eat etc. Every antipsychotic made me more psychotic, Ativan and hydroxozine increased anxiety, heart palpitations, and made me unable to sleep. I was hospitalized 3 times from August 2023-December 2023. The final hospitalization changed my life. I blame it on uncomfortable beds making me realize I never wanted to be hospitalized again but I also feel like I finally found a med combo that really worked for me. It’s been almost 2 years. I still take daily panic attacks, but no longer go to the ER, realize I’m not having heart attacks, and am able to drive locally in my small rural county. Recently though, things are getting bad again. I can’t drive on certain roads, I feel like things look or feel wrong, panic attacks are worsening to feeling like heart attacks again, I’m feeling depressed, hopeless, lonely. It almost comes in waves of every few weeks or months I can do good then bad in a continuous cycle. I’ve been so proud for the year and a half to be able to stay out of the hospital and fully be the mom I want to be, but I’m scared again, like things are getting worse. It feels like after so long my meds just stop working even after increasing the dosage. I’m now at the max dose of Zoloft and Buspar, and my psychiatrist will not increase my Xanax though I’m at a low dose. I don’t want to go through trying new meds again because I had bad reactions to so many, and don’t have the support of childcare for the many months it would take to try different meds and get adjusted. I think I either hit my head too hard in the crash, or just feel the immense amount of guilt of how badly I Fd up. I paid my dad back every penny for the telephone pole and car. I plead guilty in court to my DUI and quit drinking. I still feel guilty and like it ruined my life. If it never happened would I have a panic disorder? Would I be a better mom? Would I be able to travel and go on vacations? Work a full time job and have a decent income? I don’t know. I just want to know how others’ Panic Disorders started, and if they come in waves of being okay for a bit then terrible for weeks or months at a time.

1lzwxjo,Xanax gave my life back,"I’m agoraphobic, have been for 14 years. I know Xanax doesn’t work for everyone, but I wanted to share anyways for people like me who have been hesitant to try it. 

I’ve tried all the coping skills(some help some don’t) and a few other meds prescribed by my dr. But Xanax by far does exactly what I want it to do. I had a few panic attacks when I was younger and developed really bad agoraphobia to the point where I would say no to doing things I actually really wanted to do, but was SO afraid of having panic attacks that I didn’t even want to risk it. Over the course of 14 years, my biggest issue became the fear of having panic attacks. Just this last year, I’d had enough of agoraphobia ruining my life, and worked with a Dr. who let me try Xanax. 

Simply having a “weapon” to fight against the panicky feeling was enough to slowly reduce my fear of panic attacks. I could take Xanax before an event or situation that I was afraid of, and my brain just calms itself. It’s amazing. 

I don’t have constant panic or anxiety, so for those types of people, benzos may not be the most helpful because it can be so addicting. I just use Xanax for certain occasions where I’ve had a panic attack before and am afraid of having one again.

1lzsvqd,Ativan once a week?,"Hey all! Was hoping to get some advice here. I've been prescribed Ativan 0.5mg to be used as needed to manage my current onset of panic disorder as a result of Thyroid issues. I take it quite sparingly, Half a tablet before high anxiety events at most to a max of 0.5mg per week (self limited). Recently my cadence has been pretty much 0.5mg per weekend as it's summer and I want to be able to go do events and really push through while also getting some exposure therapy with very minor help from Ativan.

Is this high enough to cause rebound anxiety at a later period or through the week when I don't take it? Just wondering as I have noticed some minor rebound a day or two after I've taken the dose before a big event.

I will say anticipatory anxiety is a huge component for me at the moment so it's hard to tell if it's that or rebound from ativan. I also take buspirone and that manages a decent chunk of my daily minor anxiety though doesn't do as much for event based anxiety.",1752514535.0,panicdisorder
1lzs96n,Medication for Flight,"I suffer from panic disorder and death anxiety, which also causes agoraphobia. I was on SSRIs for a long time, then stopped for a period. My death anxiety worsened over a few years, so I went back on them and am now on 50mg of Sertraline. I used to be prescribed Loprazolam (originally for insomnia) by my previous doctor, which I used for flying due to my fear of having a panic attack on a plane where help is unavailable. I'm not actually afraid of flying itself. I also suffer from paroxysmal AFIB (occasional irregular heart flutter episodes) and was prescribed 40mg of Propranolol (a beta blocker) for these rare episodes, My doctors now refuse to prescribe Loprazolam, and I've struggled to get any benzodiazepine for severe situations, mainly related to agoraphobia. However, I managed to get a short-term supply of Lorazepam, which is also a benzodiazepine, though I'm unsure if it's as strong as Loprazolam. I'm really nervous about what to take for an upcoming flight. Last time I flew, I wasn't on SSRIs and took a couple of Diazepam (a short-term agreement) and a Propranolol just before the flight. It was tough but manageable, with a few waves of anxiety but no physical symptoms.I'm unsure what to do for this new flight. I'm now on SSRIs and like the idea of using Propranolol for anxiety, as it reduces the physical symptoms I worry about, mainly my heart beating fast and fear of a heart attack. However, benzodiazepines help with mental worry and calming, which is why I would ideally take both. This is causing me anxiety about taking both medications. I've asked the doctors for their view, and from what I understand, there are no immediate concerns other than a potential increase in medication effects. I feel confused and don't want to take unknown meds; Loprazolam was always a known entity, but I can't get it. I want to eventually overcome this but need to manage this first flight after a long period of not flying. Any advice is welcome. Still waiting to hear from the doctor.",1752513164.0,panicdisorder

1ly3phi,12 years of panic,"I started having panic attacks at the age of 7, I’d wake up every night in the middle of the night to panic, heave and throw up. (I also had night terrors as an infant and toddler which led to me scratching at the walls in fear and sometimes even caused seizure’s) I’ve always been the kid that leaves sleepovers first because I had to call my mom to pick me up from the shear panic I felt every night. My mom gets them too but nowhere close to as extreme as mine. I was always a skinny kid because I was afraid if I ate enough to make my stomach full then it would hurt so much more later when I threw up. Always had extremely graphic and horrifying nightmares. Couldn’t do school trips out of state or even eat far from home. Went home early in high school or would just not go at all some days. Could never do any extracurricular activities that weren’t sitting still quietly.

I find it hard to find others who have experienced such a crippling level of anxiety since such a young age. Everyone else seems to develop PD at later more stress inducing parts of life but I’ve always lived like this. I see people say that they don’t feel the same since their first panic attack but I can’t even pinpoint what it ever felt like to not have them. Sometimes it feels impossible to imagine a life without it. Since I lost my job in October of last year I have been spiraling with anxiety and depression which I’ve always had but I’m becoming much more agoraphobic than I was before when I was forced to go out and do things. Now the only thing that’s forcing me to go outside is this vacation with my dad but it doesn’t sound like vacation to me, it sounds like hell.

I’ve used weed to self medicate since I was 15, but over time when you become addicted to the feeling of not thinking it starts to get miserable when thoughts start up again. I’m so terrified at the thought that there will be nothing to shut these thoughts off, and I know I’m supposed to go through the motions of dealing with it myself but I’ve tried all the breathing techniques, the meditation, teas and natural remedies, you name it I’ve tried it. I’m afraid the only thing left to help me is medication but it’s hard to even find a psychologist who takes my insurance. I’m not afraid of going on planes but it always gives me immense anxiety for the first hour of being there.

I at one stage was rly struggling with my anxiety and tried medication. The meds gave me terrible panic attacks and weird symptoms

Ever since then I’ve done a lot of inner work and I have very low anxiety and stress levels these days. However every few months I get nocturnal panic attacks where I’ll just randomly wake up out of my sleep feeling panic (it only ever happens like this, never had one in the day or anything). 

I don’t have the best sleep schedule and feel when my sleep is bad they may be more likely to get triggered. I am just trying to find a way to find the root cause and prevent them happening or do things like mediation and good sleep to stop them happening. 

Is the trigger likely the first ever one I had while on those meds and now I just get them every few months because of that? Any way to get over them?

Whenever I’m out in the world I get completely lost in my thoughts, only to then “remember” where I am and start panicking. It’s a bit hard to describe, but basically I disassociate and lose track of where I am and what I’m doing.

I don’t realize this is happening because I’m so used to being in my head with ten different radios playing. The issue is that when I come back to earth — for instance, if they call my name at Starbucks — it’s as if someone changed the channel without warning me, and I freak out. My thoughts feel more real than the world around me. If you’ve ever been way too stoned, and suddenly had that moment of clarity when you realize you’re too stoned and have no idea what you’ve been doing… It’s kind of like that.

Started off strong, but the brain became busy again with “what ifs” and the panic cycle repeated itself. Legs weak, heart racing, shaky steps, busy brain…again. I made it back home safe, sat down, had some electrolytes, iced my face, and cried! I am grieving the past version of myself who could walk for miles, but I’m also SO proud of the girl who chose to do another lap. I’m not sure it gets easier, but I know we become stronger. *PS I’ve learned to not always push in exposure therapy so I’m not necessarily saying to ALWAYS challenge yourself, but sometimes it’s what we need.

1lr01a8,I don‘t know what to do,"TL;DR
Hey, so.. I think if anyone knows what to do, it‘s people on this sub, so I wanted to ask something.

My first language isn‘t english, so forgive me for my bad grammar and stuff.
I am 22 years old, and I have had to struggle with panic for almost 5 years now. I think I got it, because my mom has it too, but my initial trigger was a random pressure on my chest, shortly after I had a longer visit at the hospital, including an operation. Back then my first thought was a heart attack (ofc) and after two weeks of panic and almost calling the ambulance multiple times (one time I actually did, just so they could tell me, nothing is wrong) I felt like I was dying almost every day. 
A few months later, a doctor told me I got pressure on my chest, because I got a weird back, and it‘s causing this feeling, which is causing a panic attack. These attacks last several hours for me. It wasn‘t easy, but I learned to deal with it, because I suddenly had a good explenation for it, and made these an exception.

A few years later it picked up again. I got into a very bad breakup, and into a new relationship almost instantly after that. We moved in together and times werent always smooth. On top of that, I got into a huge debt, that I am still paying off, until the end of this year rn. My attacks came back, stronger and harder than ever. And they get worse by the month. I am at a point where I get them every two days, to every day now. It‘s not strictly about getting heart attacks now. They come randomly. Sometimes I think my brain isn‘t getting oxygen. Sometimes I get dizzy suddenly without warning. It feels like getting shot in the head.

I just really want to know from someone who knows his or her stuff.. will it ever end? Can I beat this? And if yes, whats the best way to do it? I can‘t just stop working and paying back my debt, for example..
Can I ever go back to the way I used to live? Without constant fear? I am literally going through hell, almost every day. 
Thank you for your answers in advance!",1751574609.0,panicdisorder
1lqx9dk,I'm really tired (TW),"It's my first time ever writing on Reddit, so please forgive any mistakes also English is not my main language. 

3 years ago, I found that I have Coronary syndrome, in a routine check (lucky me), a stent was placed and my main artery got unblocked. Never had a heart attack (double lucky me) and that created a problem that will be relevant below, I don't know how a heart attack looks like. That was when my problem started. I started to get sudden chest pain, difficulty to breath, numbness on left hand and visits to doctors started along with many trips to ER. Results were fine and within range but the episodes went on and on. 

My main doctor then suggested I start sessions with psychologist, which I did and we started with cognitive behavioral therapy( hope I wrote that correctly). Months went on and situation actually got worse, so the psychologist suggested me to go to psychiatris which I did. She was very helpfull and understanding, she diagnosed me with panic disorder, so we procceded with Remeron 30mg (it was the only acceptable, due to my other heart medications) and Xanax 0,25mg for the difficult time. And I used Xanax really only when it got unbearable (my previous pack expired with another 6 pills inside).

After 1 year my both my psych doctors told me, that I was fine and didn't need therapy anymore and that I had all the tools I needed to deal with what will show up. Things were fine for about 9 months, panic attacks were few and manageable without medication. Suddenly about 3 months ago, things got worse, it wasn't anymore panic attacks, but like a huge build up which lasted for Days! Whole body very tense and the feeling that something is very wrong, like I don't belong in my body. I tried to manage it, but it only got worse, more days of build up, small releases, a day of clarity and again, on repeat. New medical checks, all fine as always so I went to psychiatrist again and we started Remeron 30mg, since it worked last time...

Only now results were different, panic attacks actually became a day after day issue, with build up periods in between and 0 days of relax. So 2 days ago we increased the medecine to the maximum dosage of 45mg which brings us to today, where I had my worse episode. 

I was driving to my work, when I started to feel a huge tightness in the chest and I couldn't breath, my heart went to 131 and my luck.... I had forgot my phone at my work,so no way to call anyone.Drive 8km back home, wasn't a valid option in my state. Only thing I could do, was take a Xanax and really hope for the best. Another problem was that the road where is was is rural with lots of fields and not so many cars or houses, to stop someone and ask for help. And the final problem is that even when I reached my job, there was about 600m of walking, cause cars can't pass. I somehow reached the parking and started to walk, really struggling to breath and feeling that I will pass out. As you can guess, I'm better now and obviously ER wasn't needed. I know that panic attack can't kill you and you just have to accept it, but here I am with a questions that I haven't found answer yet.

How can I not worry and accept it when 1)i have a pretty good reason to fear the chest pain and 2)in my case, panic attack CAN actually kill me, since my heart rate can't exceed a certain level? 

Last details, is that my pains aren't always the same, not in the same location. Sometimes it's chest, sometimes it's neck or back, sometimes left hand or left leg. But the chest area is the one that really frightening me. Also, none of copying techniques help me, nor breathing and especially not the walking, actually walking make it worse. 

Psychiatris told me, that my ""Fight or Flight"" system is broken, which mean, that if I get a jump scare, like a sudden dog bark for example, which for a regular person last 10 seconds, my body is guarding for that threat for hours and if a new ""threat"" shows up, it keep piling up, till the big bang. It is really exhausting... 

Really sorry for the long post, but I had to get it out of me, cause I'm really really tired of not finding anything to help me be at least somehow normal.

TL;RD I have a valid medical reason to fear my panic attacks, has anyone same issue to help me process it? ",1751567837.0,panicdisorder

I'm just so sick and tired! I've been given 4 new medications since may and so far the only one that has helped in the slightest is Lorazepam. Which is also not great because I can't take it every night.
I can't close my eyes because I immediately start panicking, and my attacks involves literal blood curling screaming, so the only times I sleep is when I pass out from exhaustion and don't notice my eyes shutting. 
If I'm lucky, I get 4 hours of sleep. And I swear the constant sleep deprivation is just making it worse. 
I'm just so scared that it won't end this time, even though I think that every time I'm in an episode and somehow make it out. But I don't know how I did it, and I don't even know how it usually goes from panic every waking second to sometimes it crosses my mind.

1log7oe,dejavu and panic attacks,"Hi, sometimes I experience certain symptoms although I don’t even know if they really are symptoms or if there’s something wrong with me. I start to feel a very strange kind of mental confusion. I’ll try to describe some of the things I experience:

I begin to remember dreams I had while sleeping, but the truth is I don’t actually remember them. It’s the same sensation you get when you wake up and try to recall a dream but can’t. I start feeling a similar sensation, but long after I’m fully awake. Then I begin to recall traumatic things from the past and feel a sense of panic. However, those memories aren’t very clear they’re confusing.

Sometimes I suspect it might be because I didn’t drink enough water or didn’t eat sufficiently, but it’s not that sometimes it happens even after I’ve eaten well. I thought it might be some kind of mental confusion from diabetes, but I'm 99% sure i don’t have diabetes ( I'm young and not overweight ).

What I experience is like a panic attack and mental confusion I can’t think properly. The trigger seems to be this: I’m watching something on TV or doing something, and what I’m watching gives me the feeling of “wait, I’ve seen this before,” it’s like a déjà vu, you know? That feeling that “what’s happening now has happened before,” and then I get that déjà vu sensation, but I can’t remember exactly when that moment happened in the past, no matter how much I try.

In short, it goes like this: I have a déjà vu which is something normal that everyone has, the feeling that “this moment has already happened in the past” but when I get this déjà vu, I start to panic and experience mental confusion. I can’t think properly or formulate thoughts correctly, and my heart races; it’s very strange.

I also start remembering dreams I’d forgotten. I’m not referring to dreams in the sense of “aspirations,” I mean literal dreams you have while sleeping. I start recalling them, but I can’t remember them clearly it’s all confusing and strange. I also think I have a bit of recent memory loss, like: I wrote this text and then re-read it to check if it was correct, but it felt like I didn’t remember writing it. As if my memory of writing it had been sort of erased.

Anyway, what happens is that when I get a déjà vu, that triggers an entire episode of panic and mental confusion and I have no idea what it is. It happens a few times a year. Lately it’s been more frequent like almost every month, I think.",1751310380.0,panicdisorder

April 2024 I suffered a panic attack so severe that it spiraled me into a 4 month mental breakdown. it was… terrifying to say the least. 

fast forward a year and some change later and I am doin so much better, but not many people acknowledge the PTSD of panic disorder and how certain terrifying moments just stick with you and rear their ugly head every once in a while, even when you are on the path to healed (or are healed!)

my main cause for anxiety back in the really rough days were dpdr and losing sense with reality, I described it to my therapist as “it feels like I died, and this is my purgatory”. I just could not cope with how I went from “normal” to well… not… in a matter of one single panic attack. 

the feeling that you’ve lost grip with reality is not uncommon in panic disorder but it’s still an unnerving feeling to me now because it brings up so so many terrifying moments and thoughts and fears that I would never get to where I am now. luckily I have the coping mechanisms to know that I’m here, but sometimes it’s still just as unsettling.

I’m posting this here because I want others who suffer panic or anxiety to know they’re not alone. I’m seeing a new therapist soon and plan to share this with her to help explain the full scope of what I experience. I also hope to continue updating here as I work through it with therapy and support from my partner. I’m also open to any advice or suggestions from those who have gone through this!

-

Leading up to the trip, I’ll tell myself it’s okay, this time will be different, because of whatever reason (ex. Closer to home, I know people going, I’m not in charge of anything). If I think about it at all, I will either distract myself and tell myself it isn’t happening for a long time or I’ll feel like, oh I feel so good about this one. I feel so good and at peace. I couldn’t have a panic attack if I tried!

Then, one or two nights before the trip, I have a full on breakdown panic attack. Before any trip or experience, I typically imagine situations for what will happen on the trip. Flashes of this or that. Interactions with people, things I’ll experience, etc. These seemingly normal thoughts that I have before any event will trigger the first panic attack. I’ll imagine a situation in which might trigger a panic attack. It might be imagining hanging out with people I don’t know or feel comfortable with and anticipating how that would feel and realizing how that might trigger a panic attack. Or I imagine hanging out in my hotel room alone and how that might trigger it. Different things like that. Then I start to feel it. Heat all over my body, sweating profusely immediately. I start trying to reason with myself, breath, talk myself down. It only lasts a few seconds or minutes before I no longer feel like myself. It’s like a flip switches and panic takes over. I start spiraling through the options. I beg my partner to drop everything and come with me. Financials no longer matter. His job no longer matters. Whatever it costs. I beg and beg and beg. I plead with him. He does his best, but he just tells me to breathe. He refuses to talk with me until I calm down because he can’t come with me and he’s afraid to tell me that he can’t. We’ve been together for 15 years and we’ve been through so much together. These events scare him in a way I’ve never seen before. In the panic, I understand his fear as rejection, deepening the panic. I feel deserted and alone and afraid of everything and everyone involved in the situation, including him. The panic comes in waves, not ever fully leaving. I go through hot flashes and cold flashes. I pace for hours. I try to breathe. My thoughts spiral. I think of every option to get out of this. I go through waves of - “I’m okay, this is silly” to all logic and reasoning completely escaping me. I can’t do this, but I also can’t logically explain why. I feel a tightness in my chest that suffocates me. I’m trapped in my own body. I sweat like no heat or exercise has ever made me sweat before. I decide on a way to escape. I bail on the trip that I’ve felt excited about for months. I lie to my colleagues, saying I’m too sick. It isn’t a complete lie, but they think it’s physical. In a way, it is. My stomach can no longer keep ahold of its contents. My body is exhausted. But my brain did this, not a bacteria or virus. 

I feel like a loser. A failure. A disappointment. A burden. A waste. I’m so tired. Im so relieved, but I still feel horrible. The panic is gone, but what if it comes back? I’ll have to deal with this again. But I can’t. I can’t handle this. I’m so tired.

The next day, I feel safe. I’m a little nervous about there possibly being consequences for cancelling this trip. I’m prepared to pay back my reimbursements for the hotel, but now I must continue playing sick. I hate lying. I’m grateful for my friends and partner who know the truth and have said all the right things. I’m grateful to my colleagues for being so kind. I feel horrible for lying about being physically ill, but I know that it was a valid concern that they may not understand the severity of the panic attacks. If someone has never experienced prolonged panic, they don’t understand how incredibly traumatic and debilitating it is. I’m still exhausted and depleted from the panic attack yesterday. I know that it can take days to recover. For days, I’ll feel exhausted and constantly on the brink of panic. I’m terrified that the panic will latch onto more. But for now, I’m safe, so I focus on that until I no longer feel so close to the edge of panic.

Eventually, the memory of the panic feels so distant. That was a different person who experienced that. I feel so sad for her. I’m a little embarrassed for her. I feel so separated from her that I almost forget how the panic feels. I feel like a different person. I’m grounded again.

If this resonates with you, I hope it brings some comfort or validation. Thank you for reading.

1lj37eg,Bad derealization,It feels like things are getting worse. My anxiety feels different. It’s more terrifying. I keep getting the sensation that nothing is real. I will just be going about my day and suddenly I am hit with the realization that life is completely fake. It feels like I will wake up. It is a terrible feeling. It causes me to panic. I am not sure how to get help. I try to tell myself that it is derealization. I tell myself it is only a feeling. I also have OCD and think I might be obsessing over these thoughts about how nothing feels real sometimes. It fills me with immense dread. It feels like nothing can make it better. I always considered the ER the place where I want to be when I’m panicking because most of my panic attacks are centered around health anxiety. Now it seems like even the ER won’t save me and that is devastating. I am so tired of fighting this feeling. It is so debilitating and scary. I am so scared. I don’t know what to do.,1750743974.0,panicdisorder
1lj1wj4,Today i didnt panic,"11 days, today is the 11th day. Ive had back to back panic attacks every day since last friday (the 13th lol).

I don't cry easily, but im tearing up right now because this is the hardest thing i have ever experienced in my life and i dont have anyone to tell about this so im telling you.

I did not know it was possible to feel this bad. The hardest part is not knowing if it will end, or wondering if im wrong about what caused it and it will continue or reoccur and never get better. This terrifies me daily.

Im not fixed or cured or anything but all day i was expecting panic attack and it didnt happen so im celebrating. Anxiety was quite bad today obviously but thats cake up against panic, up against any other day for the last 10 days.

Im not religious but i found myself praying every day.

The attacks lasted from 1-4 hours at a time, with a intense 30 minute peak in the middle. 1-3 attacks a day.They were triggered by a combination of 3 things: 
-Chewed nicotine gum equivalent of 8 packs of cigs a day for several years (nervous system shot)
-job promotion with new responsibilities (overwhelmed)
-a bad reaction to an SSRI (it made everything 10x worse)

I am now managing all 3 of these things, and am 1 week off the SSRI. I only took it for about a week

If it wasn't for hydroxyzine hydrochloride i would be in the hospital. Ive been diagnosed with panic disorder and have dealt with it for years. This is a whole new level i was not aware was psychologically possible, the hydroxyzine knocks it down for a few hours at a time so i can breathe for a while.

Im still having to take a lot of hydroxyzine 3 times a day but safe amounts and im tapering because of the brain fog.

Ive learned coping mechanisms because i didnt have a choice not to. I had to change the way i was thinking about this experience or i wouldnt be able to tolerate it.

This sounds corny but I did not know that i had the strength to survive this long without going in to the hospital. I've discovered a strength in myself that defys logic. I get that it sounds weird or self-agrandizing (how do you spell that)

Here is a poem i wrote 4 days ago.

""300 minutes""
If it doesn't stop in 10 minutes
Ill go to hospital
If it doesn't stop by then
I'll go

This shouldnt even be possible
But it is

If it doesn't stop in 10 minutes
Hot, spitting hell,

1live3j,This shit really sucks!,"Just screaming into the void here, but god panic disorder sucks so much! 

Been struggling with it on and off for the last 6 years of my life if not longer, and every time I think I'm done with it, it comes back one way or another. 

My recent development? Nocturnal panic attacks, because I guess normal daytime panic attacks were too easy.       
I'm exhausted, I'm tired, but I'm also deeply afraid to even attempt to go to sleep because I know there is a serious likelihood that I'll wake up 1-2 hours in with a panic attack. 

It sucks so much, you're in extreme physical and mental discomfort, your thoughts racing, heart beating out of your chest. Just a minute ago you were asleep and now you aggressively got pulled out of it.      
It's 3AM, your friends and family are asleep, the world around you appears quiet and deserted. Derealisation kicks in, what's even real anymore? You focus on your heartbeat and are convinced the next one is going to be the last. Walking circles around the living room, your legs trembling, you feel nauseous and like you're about to pass out. 

Fuck this! Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.   
   
Genuinely unsure how much longer I can balance my professional job while also dealing with this, I need a break from day to day life but unfortunately it doesn't work like that lol

1lieprf,Meds or coping mechanisms,"I'm curious if people found therapy/coping mechanisms more helpful than starting medication.
I wasn't always a super anxious person but starting developing PD symptoms after graduating college which exploded when I hit 24. I was basically agoraphobic for a couple months. With the help of the DARE app I've been on the up and out for almost a year now and can do everything I need. But I still struggle with the panic daily. For example, my biggest issue is highway driving. I went from not being able to drive at all to a couple months ago driving 9hours away by myself. However the whole time I had anxiety that I was doing my best to disperse. I still deal with it despite being able to disperse panic attacks. It makes me wonder if meds would help take away this presence of anxiety? My cousin who also has PD is on Prozac though and she still battles attacks daily. But I don't think she has gone to therapy to learn any coping mechanisms. 
TLDR I'm curious if people who may be in the same boat as me were able to fight it off with continued practice of coping mechanisms and untrained bad behavior that way or if you need meds to really shut off the unnecessary fight or flight response for good? Thanks :) ",1750679979.0,panicdisorder

1li672f,hey guys! venting!,"Hey, guys. It’s been a minute since I’ve had to post on one of these servers (which is great, it means my panic has been in remission!)…. what’s not so great is that I’ve been having a particularly and peculiarly rough few days with panic and I’d like to share my experience and seek some solidarity. I have panic disorder as well as healthy anxiety/health OCD, which I think is a pretty common comorbidity. During the last year of my life, I got sober, got into a great relationship, got on Prozac (which I’m now up to 30mg) and made some awesome changes that have paved the way for real relief. However, the older I get, the more terrified I seem to fear of death. I even preemptively feel fear for how I’m going to feel in my thirties, as I’m 26, now. I sprained my ankle BADLY taking a spin class about a week ago, and I can’t stop obsessing about whether the purpling bruising is a blood clot. I know, logically, it’s not. As a result of that obsession, I’m experiencing physical symptoms (left arm pain, tight chest that won’t stop.) I have had cardio phobia for years. I got a heart x ray last summer, have worn a Holter Monitor two summers ago, and still can’t seem to believe that I’m ok because I am experiencing palpitations, too. I usually use nicotine (redundant, I know) and have even laid off the nicotine today, only to feel worse. This isn’t new, this happens all of the time. I have learned how to combat waves of panic while sitting at a table with people, to feel completely dizzy and afraid and not show signs of it, because I don’t want to seem weird. I am so exhausted, of being afraid to fall asleep because my chest hurts and I had a heart palpitation earlier in the day. I wish I could feel safe in my body. I know that no one lives forever, but the obsession is wild. I’m wondering if I should go up on my meds, I brought it up to my psych a bit ago and she said it would be ok.

After all this time I still don’t know what my underlying issue is. I know my triggers but unfortunately my triggers are unavoidable. Things like hot weather, being outside in nature, sometimes just having to be at a certain place at a certain time like work. My therapist said it’s because I was groomed to be an anxious person, a person who needs to worry about how things will turn out. I trust her but even if that’s the reason- I still wake up on a random Tuesday where NOTHING is going wrong and I have nothing to do besides my extremely easy job and I still have anxiety so badly it turns into depersonalization.

1lhq0h9,I Beat Panic Disorder,"Hey everyone.

It’s been a while since I last visited this sub, but I wanted to share some positive news. Most people here are going through literal hell on earth, so uplifting posts are rare.

My journey started on July 18, 2024. I’d experienced anxiety before, but never such a strong panic attack as that day. From then on, my anxiety was through the roof—I always thought my days were numbered. I had a bunch of different sensations happening 24/7 (you can check my post history for more details).

I tried a lot of things: tracking my triggers, setting better boundaries at work, reducing my working hours, reading a bunch of books, learning about panic, and, of course, endless health checks (which cost me a lot of money, but ultimately gave me peace of mind and helped me accept that it was just panic).

What helped me most was researching panic disorder and doing exposure therapy. I set small “missions” for exposure—walk outside the house, stay out for five minutes, do three jumping jacks. I considered a mission successful if I completed all three subtasks. Once I was comfortable with one mission, I created new, more challenging ones.

The most important thing is to know that the journey is challenging (it’s extremely hard at the beginning, but gets a lot easeir the more you grow)—it’s not easy, but that’s how you improve your position and outlook.

I went from having rolling panic attacks lasting several hours to now being completely free from panic attacks (I’ve had only one in the past two months). I still get anxious sensations here and there, but my brain no longer spirals into panic. After a while, you almost get bored of the same story/sensations of dying lol—that’s how I felt once I learned about the condition.

Again, I know this is absolute hell, but I wish you bravery and strong willpower—you will overcome this. I accomplished it without medication, I know some people might be curious. I’ve also recorded my entire journey, day to day, from when I was really down to today, but I’m still not sure if I want to share that. :)",1750604604.0,panicdisorder

I've been doing okay in my anxiety disorder journey for the past year. I'm currently tapering off my medication and functioning normally. My panic attacks are now very rare, and when they do happen, they usually only last about a minute. I can also go out with someone, although I’m still working on my agoraphobia, especially when it comes to going out alone.

Recently, though, I've noticed something strange—talking to people about anxiety and its symptoms sometimes causes me to experience symptoms I don’t normally have. It’s like my body reacts just from hearing about it. On top of that, some people have started seeking reassurance from me about their own symptoms, and I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed.

I wasn't involved in her accident, and it was years ago. Why am I getting a racing heart, weird breathing, shaky, lightheaded, etc?! I'm not sure if it's the thought of suffering and how awful I would feel if I had/have to experience what happened to her, etc. But this is ridiculous. I hate feeling so broken, and I just want to get out of this fight or flight response mode for good. 😕 There's got to be a way!

Side note: after I initially calmed down once we started talking about different things, of course I felt the after effects of the attack so I was still lightheaded and then I start down another route of thinking - ""What if I faint? How embarrassing would that be in front of my new coworker and what if I cause her anxiety and panic because she thinks I'm going to die? What if my blood pressure won't calm and I have a stroke? What if I can't breathe, how awful would that feel?!""

1lf0exu,Something more going on?,"Apologize for the length, but what i’ve been dealing with for the past 8 months or so has been incredibly intense and I need advice. I’ve had people and doctors tell me that these don’t sound like just panic attacks there’s something medical going on, and others tell me that they’re just very severe ones. Idk what to think or do. I feel like they’re not what I normally hear people describe panic attacks as.. 
I’m 23 y/o girl, had GAD and OCD my whole life, when I got into middle school I had what I thought were panic attacks, all the time. 8 a day. Wasn’t able to go to school or restaurants or anything, I would get super nauseous, run outside from wherever I was so I could feel “safe” and pace around, shaking, etc. but was over quickly, maybe 15-30 minutes. No SEVERE symptoms. Maybe they were just anxiety attacks?
What happens now though: 
Triggered by dim lights, fluorescente lights, crowd noises, loud repetitive sounds, etc. and many times would happen from health anxiety, tho i’ve started getting better with that now.
I can tell one will possibly happen because I will start dissociating like crazy. I’m talking things look hazy, can’t focus my eyes on anything, stumbling over words, etc. This could be even like an hour beforehand. 
Then It will just keep getting worse and worse, then i’ll have an initial “head drop” sensation (sometimes. Sometimes it’s just the dissociation part), then insane dizziness, tunnel vision and nausea.
Then all the other severe symptoms will come on SOMETIMES, if it’s a bad one, (numbness, racing heart, lightheaded, doom sensation, and ill think im dying, etc.) all i’ll have the real wave of panic. 
The only thing is though, even after the initial intense panic is gone, the other symptoms stay for 2-4 hours but I will be left unable to MOVE, SPEAK, understand anything around me, etc. for this whole time. Body too weak, practically convulsing too hard to take steps, dizziness so bad I am falling over. The whole 2-4 hours. Sometimes now that I’m used to them I know i’m not dying so I don’t even get the other terrible symptoms either. It can just be that.
My boyfriend has to carry my to the bathroom every 30 minutes or i’d pee myself. 
All I know how to describe it as is that this INTENSE wave of drowsiness comes over me, LITERALLY like I am wasted drunk or greening out, and i’ll barely even be able to keep my eyes open with how intense the drowsiness is so i’m constantly like fighting them open this whole time. And whole time whether I have other severe symptoms or not my whole body is shaking so viciously… 
Could someone PLEASE let me know if you have experienced it like this? Even without the normal panic attack symptoms accompanying? If this sounds like just a normal panic attack? Everyone says they’re over quick you just have to ride them out etc. and it makes me feel so alone. I just need to find the right support.

I ran my own business for about 3 years until January of this year, but business slowed and im back joining the workforce. 

About a month ago I was offered a job that required my class B CDL, I did all the training and drove the truck to the testing site and BAM! Horrible panic attack, dizzy, derealisation, dry mouth, clammy, and cold sweats. I could barely talk and had to make an excuse to leave.

Since then I've been in a constant state of panic even thinking about interviewing or going to work. I love hard work and I love getting out of the house but I cant leave home without panicking. I start therapy next week and hoping to get on stronger medication but I need to be bringing money in. We are not in the best financial spot and we have 2 children.

1leay50,PTSD and Panic Disorder,"This is my story of the time I ate 5 dried grams of magic mushrooms when I was 18 and left me with diagnosed Panic disorder and PTSD. 

I was 18, fresh out of college and not knowing where to go in life. I was smoking weed everyday, using other drug$ and kind of lost in life. After watching thousands of videos about the positive benefits of shrooms and how it saved so many peoples lives, I decided to ""save my life"" and do a heroic dose of mushrooms, by myself in silent darkness. 

I waited till almost midnight and ate the 5Gs, I also smoked a lot of weed right after I ate them to get the maximum trip I could get. I turned the lights off and laid in bed and was coming up, I remember feeling really irritable, nervous, agitated, I couldn't stop moving and squirming, I saw thousands of demons faces telling me I can't come in, your not welcome, kind of mocking me. All of a sudden it was like the plug was pulled, my soul my everything, launched into the infinity of space, I felt weightless, I felt like nothing but everything at the same time but to me It felt exactly like I just died. EGO DEATH. I touched my face and my hands went through my face, it was then when it happened. FULL BLOWN PANIC ATTACK.

I jumped out of bed and ran to my door, I could see light in the door hinges getting further away, as I was getting smaller and slower, to me It felt like if I didn't reach that door, I was dead. I got to the door swang it open ran to the mirror, saw a reptillian creature but it was me. I expected to see my face all gored up or something, I remember hearing the world ending, I ran back in my room in full blown panic heart rate 200+bpm and I couldn't think. It was too intense, I couldn't believe what had just happened to me I was in shock, I just kept repeating, I'm dying, I'm dying. I had forgotten I had even taken the shrooms at this point all I knew is that I was dying. I felt my heart being stabbed, grabbed, pulled, flutttering. I grabbed my phone to call 911 and my arms turned into old peoples arms then turned burnt and scolded and I threw the phone in panic. I had accepted my death, my eyes had the 1000 yard stare, I imagined my family coming to see me dead with foam coming out of my mouth. This lasted hours, no words can describe the terror, the horror, something so fucking horrific the human being isnt designed to experience such terror.

After the trip finally started to come down, I couldn't think straight, severe brain fog, I couldn't see straight, I was literally cross eyed after it happened, my eyes couldn't focus properly, I've never heard of this happenening to other people but my eyes stopped working properly for a few hours after it happened. Caused so much fucking trauma/shock my eyes couldn't even work. After it happened I felt really really differen't, I wasn't the same person anymore, even talking to my family felt weird, talking to friends felt weird, I felt like an alien. I was in a chronic anxiety attack with depersonalization/derealization/dissociation and I had no idea what was wrong with me, I thought I had developed schizophrenia. 

After a month thinking I was schizophrenic or in a psychosis, I had 1 beer, and EVERYTHING washed away. All the anxiety, all the tension, everything washed away and I felt great. I became an alcoholic instantly, it was the only thing in the world they gave me relief from what I was feeling. I was an alcoholic for 5 years, until it almost left me dead and in the hospital for 2 weeks for severe alcohol withdrawal. 

Now I'm picking up the pieces, I have stopped drinking, I'm seeing a gp every week, Psycholigist, Therapy, Psychiatrist. I am diagnosed with Generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, Panic disorder and PTSD. I've tried several medications and they all don't work for my type of anxiety. Even the doctors and psychatrists look at me and just have no fucking idea what to do with me.

Well thats my story, 100% real and 100% what happened to me, not talking shit about shrooms because even after this experience I've done small doses of shrooms and had lots of fun, though I was drunk. But beware, Psychedelics fucked me up more than any drug I've ever done and I will be carrying this PTSD and panic disorder for the rest of my life, and struggle with benzos and alcohol for the rest of my life.

1lcssbi,The World Overwhelming?,"In another time, most of the world’s disasters lived far away from our daily lives. But now war, conflict, collapse…it’s all right here, lit up on your phone at 3AM. The modern nervous system was not designed to process a global feed of catastrophe. Social media, 24-hour news cycles, and sensational headlines bring distant suffering into your bedroom, your commute, your dinner table. The brain’s threat detection system doesn’t know these events are far away; it only knows what it sees and hears. The amygdala activates, cortisol floods and your heart rate rises. The fear feels personal, even when the threat is not. This is vicarious threat overload …a primitive survival system attempting to solve problems far outside its jurisdiction. You’re not weak for feeling this. You’re reacting to information that was never meant to reach you at this scale.

When the spiral starts, interrupt it like this:

* Anchor your edges- Place your hands on the sides of your thighs. Apply gentle pressure inward. Feel your body’s boundary. You are contained.
* Interrupt the timeline- Say softly: ""Nothing is happening to me right now."" Speak it as fact, not hope.
* Give the system work-  Choose one object nearby and trace its shape with your eyes. Edge to edge. Let your thinking brain take over. 

And remind yourself, quietly:  
""I release what is not mine to carry.""  The world’s noise will keep coming. But your body can still learn how to step out of its current. Practice is the rewiring. No repetition, no change.",1750080442.0,panicdisorder
1lcpqr9,Caffeine Induced PD,"Hello all. Unfortunately, new member here. I could type a book but I'll try to keep it short. 

Within the past 3 months, I've realized I have PD. I've had panic attacks before (one was drug induced, the other was a medication issue) but never had them daily like I do now. I'm 28/M and have always had a love for caffeine. Would usually have 200mg a day and on days where I do double shifts I do 350-450 (which is beyond the daily recommended limit I know) but never had issues. 

In March this year, I was doing a double shift on no sleep (I also have a sleep disorder) and hit the 450 marker for my caffeine intake. Morning shift was good, the red bulls and soda helped me out and gave me the usual energy I always got. Went to my night job and chugged a red bull right away. Things were going great, I was chatting with a coworker like I usually do and was happy.. but then in a literal snap of a second, I felt a sudden change in mood and it ramped up quickly. VERY QUICKLY. The second it happened I whispered to myself ""that's not good"", and all the symptoms started happening. Sense of doom, my blood pressure felt like it dropped so much I was getting woozy, I forgot how to breathe, and my heart was off its rocker. Thankfully my coworker was cool while we were in the rush so I stepped out back to pace for awhile trying to tell myself that I'm okay and don't need to go to the ER. After 15 minutes I step back inside and as soon as I got back into my workspace, I forgot how to breathe again when I was breathing better outside. My fingers and feet were feeling tingly which I'm familiar of from my drug induced and medication issue panic attacks, but this time didn't make sense since I had no idea what triggered it. They thankfully let me go home and days after I still had this come in waves. The tingling, the sudden drop in blood pressure and racing heart, sense of doom. I had to play the guitar and breathe to re-center myself but it was happening a lot. I went to the ER the day I had my panic attack at work and everything showed up fine. EKG was clear, heart was great, blood pressure great. Brought me peace of mind but still didn't answer what happened. 

Fast forward to today, middle of June. It's gotten a lot better and I no longer get the blood pressure drops and hard to breathe effects, but I recently tried getting back into light caffeinated drinks since I'm tired throughout the day. After drinking some tea I feel a tiny bit anxiety go on, wouldn't call it an attack though.. but for whatever reason later on in the day I get to the point I have to re-center myself again. I noticed I can drink about 50mg of caffeine now and be ""okay"", but still have small panics even though I always remind myself it's just myself in my head about that one day and I do my breathing exercises. It brings me peace of mind that I have been getting better and I'm able to actually work again even though here and there I may need to take a second to breathe for a bit, but I was just wondering if anybody else here acquired PD through their caffeine intake? 

Important to note my drug induced panic attack happened in 2022 and my medication one happened last year, but never got the coming in waves things that I do get now randomly. 

**TL;DR think I drank too much caffeine one day during a double shift so now I get panic attacks in waves but it has gotten better with lower caffeine intake**",1750071274.0,panicdisorder

1lcgfr8,Severe Panic Disorder,"I’ve been having a raging panic attack for about 7 hours straight now. I’m losing my fucking mind. Every single time I get distracted and the panic goes away for .1 second, my OCD goes “panic panic panic it’s gonna get worse” (then it gets worse) “oh now you’re really thinking about it its gonna be EVEN WORSE (and then it is even worse). I’ve been passing out and throwing up all day. I’m so suicidal because of this yet I have no way of doing it so I’m stuck in pure terror and torture. I’d rather get hit by a car. I’d rather anything else honestly.

I’ve even been to specialists that told me I’m the worst case they’ve seen. That was 10 years ago. I’m still dealing with this. Granted - I had a good few years until my relapse in attacks.

My attacks are so bad that it can trigger me to go into psychosis. People close to me have said it’s like I’m speaking in riddles and I make zero sense when having an attack. I lose feeling in all muscles meaning I can’t even talk or walk.

I haven’t been able to keep food or even water down at this point. So part of me sees a relief “maybe I can just starve to death and die - then I’ll have peace”

I’m prescribed Xanax already as well as gabapentin (400mg 3x daily) plus 3 other meds. Xanax worked until my OCD brain said “that would be HORRIBLE if you managed to still have a panic attack while on Xanax”. It’s ruining my fucking life.

Every little thing. A song could come on and my OCD says “if you listen to this any longer it will trigger an attack” which it always does so I always listen like a good little dog. I’m sick of it.

If anyone’s Panic Disorder is this severe, please contact me. I feel so alone like I’m patient zero.

 Trying lots of meds. Been to tons of therapy. Cognitive and talk therapy. Group therapy. Went to an intensive outpatient therapy program. I still have panic disorder and I’m not any better than when I first got diagnosed with it. I’m in the process of losing my job because of it.  Can’t work. 

I’ve developed a phobia of medications and have full blown meltdowns over taking new or increased meds. Psychiatrist wants me to increase my busperonine. I’m so scared to increase it. I’m tired of going to the er because I’m panicking over meds. Can I go to inpatient and they can take care of me while I do med changes? I’m tired. I don’t feel good.

1lbu1kx,Panic Attack After a Bit,"First panic attack after a bit of respite (about 8 months of being good). Started after watching that new movie Sinners. I actually loved the movie but one of the songs they sing made me feel peaceful and that made me worry that I was peaceful and that made me think well then I could be ready to die, and that scared me and made me anxious. And no I don’t have any thoughts of killing myself infact that in lies a lot of my anxiety. But it was kinda some severe anxiety and I was just trying to ignore it and chill in bed when I got a hot flash and that adrenaline feeling. I immediately got up and my stomach felt sick and so I went to the bathroom and puked. After throwing up I felt a lil anxious and the shakes came on real bad. Now this is no where near how bad they used to be where it was DAYS of anxiety and panicking and severe where I couldn’t leave the house.

1lbsbrz,There isn't any help,"I gonna try to give the short version of my story because it's enough to easily write a book so here goes. In 2014 I took marijuana edibles because I was trying to quite smoking weed and didn't like the effects it had on my lungs, I called a friend to help me make them I had a half ounce or something like that in a bag I wanted to use half of it for the brownies but this idiot insisted that I must use the entire amount I had, afterwards I had a 2 trays of them and began eating them for 2 weeks straight thinking everything was good I had no experience with them, one night late at like 12:30am something inside broke it was as if I realized I was so high I couldn't take it hard to explain, my heart went completely out of control I almost broke my fathers door down in a panic eventually the heart rate stops and my father insisted I wait until the morning to go to the ER. 

  
After many visits to the ER and the dr's being completely useless and unempathetic and trying so hard to push pills on me I gave up going to hospitals, my initial reasoning was that I thought my heart or overall cardiovascular system had been damaged so I wanted reassurance if everything was alright instead I was ridiculed and given the run around and not taken seriously. I was scared to death and really believed I was gonna die from heart failure or a stroke, I wanted a bed in the hospital or to be monitored which they would not do so I decided to stealth camp in the parking lot of the hospital which was a good compromise given my situation at that time. I suffered for a year from derealization and depersonalization, heart palpitations every day  all day, panic attacks daily, extreme muscle tension basically every physical and mental symptom to the highest degree of discomfort, I did take ativan because my father bothered me non-stop to try it which I did reluctantly and had vivid hallucinations that is when I went cold turkey off of it and suffered the withdrawl effects after all this I was no where closer to relief let alone recovering.



Eventually I found an organization that understood how stress affected the nervous system and how to use the bodies built in healing mechanism to heal naturally, I began reading the materials and internalized it then I began putting it to use slowly but surely I began to recover and many of my symptoms that had plagued me disappeared, in the materials they mentioned how you must see the recovery process through to the end you can't even be 1% still physically stimulated or else your symptoms will return and I made that mistake and most of my progress was undone. At this point I was burned out from all the recovery work I had been doing  for the past year and extremely disappointed to say the least, so I stopped and just lived life the best I could with my symptoms increasing in strength over the rest of the year until my panic attacks returned and now I had a symptom where if I thought about my adrenal gland it would release adrenaline, this was so bad so again I began doing the recovery work another 8 months and I was back to where I was before, this time it was great because I was able to work out again and do runs keep in mind I would get somewhat of a symptom uptick after my workouts but it was better than nothing I had made some progress here and it was nice.



2020 was approaching and my family and I decided to move during the move we staying in a 20 foot trailer for a couple weeks before moving to our new home, this is where I developed a sleeping disorder due to the trailer being so hot in the summer time and not being able to sleep, I had problems already with adrenaline so adding heat to the mixture made it impossible to sleep. So when I get to the new home I have full on insomnia and I mean no sleep whatsoever and extreme anxiety like I had in 2014 this went on for almost a year with many extreme panic attacks where it felt like I was having a hear arrhythmia all the while the useless health/mental health care system could give a fk less, I called crisis lines where the person on the other end just wanted to get me off the line they would say just get some sleep dude really asshole why tf do you have this position fking joke, I was so wired with adrenaline it was insane I got out of the insomnia at the end of the year by getting next to no sleep at night I got up at the same time everyday and went to the library early in the day by the time I got home I would feel tired and do a 40 minute nap during these I eventually fell into a deep sleep which this transferred over to my sleep at night, finally it seems my ordeal was over with insomnia I had been sleeping really good deeply for 2 weeks until I get a phone call very early in the morning from the hospital telling me that father who lived with me and my brother at the time has 4th stage lung cancer are you fking kidding me, so needless to say my insomnia returns immediately all that brutal shit and suffering for the past year is back, the next 5 months of watching my father die  at home with little to no help from the system other than chemo which wouldn't have worked anyways he died.

  
Ever since then I've been stuck with insomnia and panic attacks I've had a sleep study done where the sleep clinic told me I would be receiving a phone call from the sleep doctor after the study, I never heard anything from them instead I book an appointment with my GP and I tell him about this to which he says I have the results of the study here it is, I'm like and he's sitting there blankly how tf do I interpret what any of this means then he proceeds to tell me what I already knew for an entire year fking bullshit, the main point is I'm being told by everyone did you do a sleep study wtf point if they don't recommend anything or help me resolve this issue this is what blows my mind how is it that these clowns call themselves sleep experts but don't know a fucking thing about how to fix sleep disorders besides selling cpap machines or handing out sleep meds, there is a book called tired but wired in it the author who is a doctor helps the patients regain their sleep she gives them a plan to help them improve and keeps up with how the fuck is that not available where I am it's bullshit and an outrage these assholes are professionals or experts sick of hearing them and people boast about that.

  
So I am now on disability this has in total with the panic disorder and insomnia together been going on for 12 years, the only help or relief I've gotten is from my own  research not from any asshole doctor in the system or psychiatrist fraud and it was all from spending my own money. I want to get better obviously the system just wants the status quo of treating my serious problems with useless pills with no science behind them because a pharmaceutical company is making a billions off of them this is disgusting and you know what with everything said I 100 000% deserve to be compensated by the government for being useless frauds, I'm so fucking enraged by the system its a bunch of people with zero first hand experience they're dead wrong in their approach, arrogant, ignorant know it alls I fucking hate them as they perpetuate the problem so I hope the problem grows so out of control it blows up in everyone's faces so that it can't be ignored.",1749963891.0,panicdisorder

1lb5yzq,If you want to get better,"Take this from someone who has been at this for 9 years now. I've taken all the meds, done the therapy, apps, exercises, etc. 

The secret to overcoming Panic Disorder finally. 

Is to acknowledge whatever it is inside you that scares you to death that you've never shared with anyone else. 

The 'FEAR' of whatever that things is, is what's lighting up the PANIC. 

For me I was frightened of my children growing up and not being able to stop what they do to harm themselves. Even as bad as that can get. I had to really reach deep into my soul to say it out loud that I was afraid of them dying before I did. I couldn't face that fear for YEARS. I've seen friends of theirs pass away from overdoses, suicides, and it just built and built and built up from there. 

It wasn't this exactly thing that brought out the panic attacks, it was a storm of all other things. But until I brushed those aside and got down to the heart of the matter. And cried, like I never cried before. 

No, it won't 'cure' it, but it will take a drastically better turn. 

I've gone down now in my meds from 375mg/day to 150mg per day, and my dose will be decreasing again soon. Lorazepam I'm given 15 with each script, I've used 2 since last November. 

I know what you're going through, the sleepless nights, the tight chests, the breathlessness, the muscle aches and terror...

Be gentle with yourselves, do not beat yourself up. You're not weak, you're not unfixable...

The answer to calm you down is within you. ",1749898630.0,panicdisorder
1latkxa,Constant state of terror,"TLDR: severe emetophobia, agoraphobia and panic disorder, anxiety feels like it will never go away as it flares up over everything. Terrified of eating food due to the phobia as it convinces me I’ll get sick every time, even though I’ve never been sick from panic.

I'm 20 and in the UK. I've dealt with emotional/psychological abuse from my parents ever since I can remember (that also used to be physical) and struggle with severe mental health challenges to this day that have left me almost completely non-functional and bedbound. Agoraphobia has left me mostly housebound since 2020, as I'd started getting panic attacks going out, and my 'solution' to this was to starve myself before leaving the house because emetophobia led me to believe my panic attacks were going to make me sick (which they never did, but I still worry about this happening every single time). Though this year my mental state has taken a turn for the worse - since this January I noticed various stimuli such as songs, TV scenes and things people say to me can lead me into a full blown panic. The list of triggers keeps growing and growing and it seems to be mainly things that remind me of being a scared little kid (which I didn't *panic* from then, but now somehow feel about a thousand times scarier when they cause me to have a panic attack).

It feels like since then my nervous system has been completely broken, as I get panic attacks a lot easier than I used to and a lot more often - nearly daily. My starvation strategy somewhat worked to keep me in school from 2021-2023, but in March this year I had a horrible panic attack outside the house even though I followed my 'rule' of starving, and rushed frantically to get home. I haven't left the house since, and my fear has just stewed and stewed to the point where it is now, where I'm in a constant state of fear and terror wondering what's next going to make me panic. It doesn't help that there's some issues I'm dealing with in real life that are exacerbating my anxiety, which is my dad getting a new partner and him arranging for her to visit for a whole week without asking me first (this happened last week, and felt really unreasonable considering my anxiety's at a point where I starve when anyone visits us), my mum moving out and the possibility of me having to move out with her because my dad's abuse has worsened since he got the partner. But I can barely think of those when I can hardly stand to simply exist without the constant terror. Everything in my life just feels completely terrifying and beyond what I'm capable of handling - I feel like I'm malnourished (which I am due to the emetophobia making me terrified of eating) and have been asked to lift a ten-tonne truck.

As for the panic attacks, I feel like I'm in a completely different state of mind when they occur. Suddenly every little thing in the environment becomes scary - the weather, the time of day, whatever people are talking about, everything that wasn't scary before suddenly is. When the panic attack wears off it mostly goes back to normal, except I worry about those things becoming scary again. I've been wondering if it's age regression or something similar because it makes me feel like a tiny little scared kid terrified of everything, but have been doubtful of that because I don't start talking/acting like a little kid when they happen. It's just like solely the fear part of the little kid takes over and nothing else, not the entire kid if that makes sense. I'm unsure what this is exactly, if these are panic attacks or emotional flashbacks or something else. Very little helps them in the moment; because I'm a freeze type I rely very heavily on games/TV as a distraction but when I'm frantic about starting up one of those to alleviate the panic it either doesn't work or makes it a bit worse. It's such an awful, torturous state of mind to be in, and for over six whole months it feels never-ending.

Basically to sum it up, I want to try to start healing and fix my broken nervous system (mainly in the context of being able to leave the house again) because I really can't take all this panicking from every little thing anymore, and more so because I'm going to have to move out to live with my mum but even just thinking about that makes me terrified especially since I haven't so much as gotten in a car since March. I'm too scared to start and don't know where to start either. I bought the books 'CPTSD: From Surviving to Thriving' and 'The Body Keeps the Score', but a combination of fear of getting triggered and poor motivation have made it hard to get through them. Any advice or insight would be very appreciated, thanks in advance.",1749855221.0,panicdisorder

1lapeme,lets ride the adrenaline,"After two years with a panic disorder diagnosis—countless nonstop attacks with an endless list of horrible symptoms, 24/7 on high alert; trying different SSRIs, popping benzos all the time; therapy after therapy; medical tests that never found anything major; losing jobs; pulling away from family; wasting money; drowning in misery every single day—I finally accepted the panic and realized that adrenaline (yes, that damn rush that can feel “good”) is what destroys me during each attack.

A few months ago, fed up with trying everything, I thought, “Screw it—if this attack is going to kill me, I want more adrenaline and I’m going to enjoy it. To hell with the world.” With whatever calm I had left, I actually tried to summon the “god of adrenaline” and asked for a heart or respiratory attack right then and there. What happened? My brain short-circuited, and instead of sending more adrenaline, it was like, “That’s not how this works, asshole—I’m sending you fear,” and the attack stopped.

I’ve been doing this for days—telling myself, “I’ll enjoy this attack, bring on the adrenaline”—and my brain does the opposite. I’ve even managed to leave my room, go to crowded places, and work out hard without the racing heart and heat waves that used to be sure signs an attack was coming.

I’m not saying this will work for everyone or that it’s the best way to deal with panic, but I finally found a comfort zone where my brain recognizes it’s just uncontrolled adrenaline.",1749844411.0,panicdisorder

I've been having this weird experience sometimes recently and was hoping to hear if others experience it. When I'm not feeling anxious or otherwise triggered, I will sometimes suddenly get this weird surge feeling. It usually feels like energy moving through my body. I get hot and cold, kinda tingly. And even though I don't feel nauseous, I feel like I need to vomit - it is hard to describe but it sort of feels like at any moment I might dry heave (the feeling is not in my stomach or throat but my entire body). These episodes don't last very long - 30 seconds to 15 minutes. It can definitely escalate to anxiety but I think that's more me responding to the fear associated with feeling weird sensations in my body. Anyone else? Any ideas?

1l9huly,any tips to overcome PD?,"Hey,  
Just wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced this and managed to get through it.

I used to struggle with anxiety, but it eventually turned into panic attacks. I was also dealing with GERD around the same time, so it really messed me up physically and mentally. Whenever I’d go outside, I’d start panicking and feel the need to go home ASAP. I’d hyperventilate and feel like I couldn’t breathe. Thought it was asthma at first, but it turns out it was panic.

I’ve been feeling much better lately thanks to meds, but I’m still scared to go out alone. My brain just doesn’t shut up — so when I do try, I usually end up glued to my phone just to distract myself. I’m tired of feeling like I need a crutch every time I’m outside.

I’ve also been working from home for the past 1.2 years, which has honestly been a lifesaver. But now my company is asking if I can start going back onsite. I’m a manager, so there’s pressure to attend face-to-face meetings and be physically present. The thing is, the idea of going back is triggering. The thought of commuting, dealing with people, being stuck in an office — it’s overwhelming and brings back those panic symptoms.

So yeah, I guess I’m just wondering:

* Has anyone actually overcome this stage?
* How did you do it?
* Is your life back to normal now?
* And how did you handle work pressure if you weren’t 100% yet?

1l9634c,Ativan to Klonopin,"*Please no comments on addiction/withdraw*

Edit to add: I know the initial onset of relief takes a little longer with Klonopin than Ativan, but what I’m saying is I didn’t feel much relief at all. I didn’t know if taking it for a couple days would help me feel the benefits more or if maybe I need a stronger dosage. 

So I have taken Ativan .5mg as needed for many years. I rarely needed it until these past couple months. That’s when I started to use it daily to help me sleep or occasionally during the day when my panic flared up. 

I am now seeing a new doctor who wants me to switch to Klonopin because it is longer lasting and I am reallllllly struggling with anxiety/panic/OCD right now. She is wanting me to take 1mg in the morning and break it in half before bedtime. She’s wanting me to do this until I can stabilize then look into switching some of the other medications I take. 

I took it this morning for the first time and honestly didn’t feel much different. I was thinking this was a fast acting drug and have read so many great things about how normal it makes people feel. 

My question is, does it take a couple days to feel the greater effects or is it possibly a dosage issue? ",1749680636.0,panicdisorder

1l8fhyp,IT GETS SO MUCH BETTER !,"I’ve had panic attacks for my entire life, the first one that I can actually remember was when I was 6 years old. However it got so so bad when I turned 15. I started getting more and more anxious doing basic things like being at school, to the point where I was so nauseous that I couldn’t eat at all. When I was 16 I went to one of my first “adult” parties where my drink got spiked. I blacked out for multiple hours and woke up on a park bench. I freaked out. That moment became a catalyst for everything else to develop. The next day I went to school and threw up uncontrollably. The same thing happened every time I went to school for a month. Eventually my symptoms got worse, I would temporarily loose my vision, I had insane migraines, my hair would come out in chunks and I started loosing a lot of weight. After two months of consistent panic attacks i lost the motivation to do anything. I stopped going to
school and work and starting isolating myself to remove the threat of these panic attacks. It kept getting worse and worse and I continued to isolate myself. I originally felt safe at home but then my safe space became smaller and smaller. I only felt ok in certain spots and i would often be confined to my room. This continued for months before I was able to get help. My life became an endless cycle of box breathing and other anti anxiety techniques. I was started on sertraline and in the first two weeks I saw zero progress, then like magic it kicked in. It was like all the anxiety and all the thoughts were silenced for the first time in my life. It’s been 2 years since that day, and i’ve experienced many life changing moments that would’ve usually created the perfect storm for a panic attack- I sat the hsc, I started university, I got a new job. However, I’m yet to have one, it feels like nothing in the world could bring that part of me back, like i’m safe within my own brain. I remember how helpless and depressed I felt when my panic disorder was at its worse and I hope that my story helps you in some way.

For context: a lot of the time, I shower facing toward the shower head because I don’t wash my hair everyday, nor do I use a shower cap. So to keep my hair dry I wash my body from the chest down. 

I have noticed a pattern, that if I stay under the water for too long, with the water hitting the front of my body, I start to panic. 

I was diagnosed with panic disorder a few years back, but it was situational. I say that to say, I do understand what panic feels like. 

It’s worse than just anxiety, and if I stayed for too long I would probably full blown be in a panic attack. 

Whenever I feel this start to rise up, I immediately turn the water off and get out of the shower. 

This doesn’t happen when I take a normal shower with my back to the warm water. 

I honestly just wondered if (a) anyone else has experienced this or (b) anyone had any guesses as to why this happens. 

Is it a normal physical trigger? Could it be a warning sign from my body that I have unresolved physical trauma that I’ve blocked out? I honestly just don’t know. I hate it though. I hate the feeling.

I have a big move coming up so I’ve been anxious. I was doing some affirmations and all of a sudden my brain had me picture my anxiety as just myself. It wasn’t a monster, just me—scared, alone, and wanting to be heard from the deep corners of my mind. I think this is what people mean when they say anxiety is not something to be afraid of… it’s just ourselves.

But recently I am struggling again. I haven’t been to work for 2 days, and all my manager said was that when I go back (tomorrow) we need to have a discussion. I’m worried about what will happen. I don’t want to lose my job, I can’t afford to. I have a wife and 2 children who need me and I don’t know if I can cope with the thought of not being able to provide for my family. Life seems so overwhelming at the minute and I don’t know if I can take it. 

I keep making the mistake of drinking heavily on a Friday or Saturday with a friend, and doing other stuff which I know after each time from how I feel, it stops my meds from working and I’m not sure if that’s 100% the reason why my anxiety and panic attacks come back after that night, I’m not sure really. I don’t even know why I do it. I have a good time in the moment but the aftermath is torture for me.

1l1y1xo,Is this normal?,"So I’ve had panic disorder for most of my life and it’s triggers have changed but a week ago it got triggered really bad and I was locked in a loop of one panic attack into another with nausea and not being able to sleep properly because my brain kept thinking I was dying when everything was fine. So I went to urgent care and they gave me medication for the attacks and nausea and I’m starting to feel better mentally but I’m just exhausted, getting up and moving around sends my heart racing like Ive just run a marathon. I’ve never had a flair up this bad, normally I have one or two and then sleep and wake up and I’m okay until it’s triggered again but I’m struggling to bounce back from this one and don’t quite understand why my body thinks it’s run a marathon when I get up to get water or do any kind of movement and I know it’s probably just normal and I need to let my body rest and recover but anything heath related triggers the panic and I’m just looking to see if it’s normal to feel like this after having around 15 attacks over a week period and that I’m not just feeding into the anxiety and panic i already have around anything Heath related.

(They ran an ekg at the urgent care and my heart was normal just an elevated heart rate from having a panic attack in the waiting room. All my vitals were normal) 

I know Its probably my brain just being paranoid and that it’s more than likely from the panic attacks, lack of sleep and not getting enough food or water in the last week. But I think I just need reassurance that I’m not alone and it’s normal to feel like this. 

I’m not having shortness of breath just a rapid heartbeat when up and moving around that feels like I’ve run a marathon and need to sit down and drink some water because I’m doing to much.

1l0p731,Wrecked my bike yesterday,"CW: death, hospice, minor injuries, sports accidents, long boring rambling stories

I’ve been having panic attacks and anxiety related to my health since January 2024. Work was completely overwhelming, my paternal grandpa had died in December, and my dad was in memory care and we knew he would be moved to hospice sooner rather than later. Since then there have been some setbacks along the way but the panic attacks have gotten much fewer and farther between and the anxiety has steadily decreased although I’m spending more time and energy than I’d like managing it. 

Yesterday we went out for a bike ride at a park with some paved trails. We were going downhill on what would have been the second-to-last leg of the ride. My wife was in front of me. I didn’t look at my stats computer but she said she was doing 22mph and I was keeping up. There was a runner coming up the hill the other direction so I moved over to give him room and tried to gently squeeze my rear brake. I must have grabbed more than I thought because the rear tire locked up and slid out into the grass. 

The bike flipped, and I flew off, landed on my left shoulder, and tumbled. I hit my left knee hard on something, overextended my right shoulder, scraped up my left arm, and either the bike hit me on the left side of my lower back or my body was so compressed from landing on my shoulder that there was some damage there too. Feels like I have some bruised ribs too. Brand new helmet did its job though. 

I laid there in the grass for a while until I felt like I could get up. Both of my bike’s wheels were bent, the rear one too badly to turn, the headset and saddle were both cranked about 30° to the left, and the rear rack was snapped off from the top stays. At the top of the hill the bike path came close to a road, so we carried my bike up and I sat in the shade while my wife got the car and came back to pick me up. 

We dropped the bikes and rack at home and then I headed off to the urgent care where they confirmed I didn’t have a concussion and hadn’t broken anything. 

Today I have no fear or anxiety about getting back on a bike. If my bike didn’t need serious repairs and the bike shop was open to buy a new helmet I’d be out there again today and if anything I’m mad that I can’t. However small, I’m calling that a win. ",1748785151.0,panicdisorder

I do not like taking things that make me feel different. I am also very fearful of side effects causing me to panic. Body sensations really set me off.

I have a lot of pill anxiety as well. I am diagnosed with OCD. It is difficult for me to take any pills because I worry that something might be wrong with them.

1kyfn4a,Propranolol?,"Hi everyone,

I currently only have Ativan in my toolbox, which I take sparingly. I’ve always avoided SSRIs because they just don’t feel like the right path for me, and honestly, I’m extremely anxious about trying new medications in general.

Recently, I started reading about propranolol, and I’m really curious if it could help me. My panic attacks are almost always heart-related, my biggest trigger is feeling my heart race. Whether it's from walking, being in a car, or even just feeling trapped somewhere, the moment I feel my pulse rise, it sends me spiraling. The racing heart is by far my worst symptom, it makes everything else feel unmanageable.. The shaking, feeling faint, air hunger..

My doctor actually suggested propranolol to me in the past, but I declined at the time because it’s technically a heart medication and that scared me. But now I’m wondering if I made a mistake. It sounds like it could be the exact thing that helps bridge the gap for me, something I could take as needed to help quiet the physical symptoms and stop the cycle before it starts. Even just having it on hand might make me feel safer.

I have a consultation with a psychologist next week (which I’m hopeful about), but I’d really love to hear your experiences with propranolol, especially if your panic is heart-focused like mine. Did it help? Were there any side effects that caught you off guard? Is it safe to take only when needed?

I want to get better. I’m just so scared of the unknown and how my body will react. Any insight or stories would mean the world to me.

Thanks in advance 💛

1kxi2o9,Moving with anxiety,"Hey guys!

I’ve been battling PD for many years and I can say I’ve made incredible strides through meds and therapy. I first started exposure in 2014–went from not being able to leave my house in CT to traveling to NYC, going to college, getting a job, etc all within a few months. I sorta stalled on exposing bc of school, but by 2020 I was able to drive a few hundred miles away from home and spent the night. Then in 2023/2024 I got sober and I got on a plane! I flew all the way to California!!!!

My life is so different but I still struggle with this. I’m moving from NYC to Florida in 2 weeks and those old panic thoughts are back in my head saying I can’t do this, I’ll have a panic attack, etc. Does anyone have experience moving so far?

I tried to accept them when it was happening, but I don't know if I did it correctly, because this made it a lot more intense. Literally nothing I did made the intensity go down, except for maybe tapping on my legs. 

I get intense derealization when I panic, and I 100% ""think"" my way into having a panic attack. Like I psyche myself out and say, ""I could have one right now,"" and if I'm already anxious, it could easily happen and then spiral and not stop for hours on end... My brain easily spirals and this definitely leads to having one. 

Then there's just a physical symptom of panic that can start me overthinking. If I don't react and overthink to that initial symptom (which I have done in the past), then the panic won't come.

Again, it's incredibly frustrating and exhausting to know that you're overthinking and making the panic worse, but not being able to calm down and stop the cycle.

1kwyacs,I need help,"I've had panic syndrome since I was 11 years old (22 now) and my attacks are related to hypochondia. I've always treated myself with medication, stopping and starting again, until I stopped taking it for good last year.

Every now and then, especially after sleeping after eating, I wake up and my heart rate goes up a lot, until I take a deep breath and drink water until I calm down. I've had several heart tests, been to cardiologists, and had blood tests, but nothing serious ever came up, just a prolapsed mitral valve (PVM), and the doctors said it was benign.

The episodes decreased, until about a month ago, I was sleeping in the afternoon and woke up in this situation again, but it was horrible, I started to despair and my heart rate went to 185/190 bpm and I said I was going to die.

I recently had blood tests and vitamins checked, but the results were normal. I'm thinking about doing a heart test again, since I did it last year, but I'm afraid of spending money (I don't have much right now) and it won't be the same as usual. After this episode last month, I went to the psychiatrist, who was worried about my high BPM and I was even more worried.

So, he prescribed escitalopram, a medication I had already taken before, but the attacks didn't get better. On the contrary, they became daily. Every time I sleep, I wake up like this, except in the morning. A previous post asked about POTS. Yes, I have some symptoms, like dizziness when I get up and a racing heartbeat when I stand for a long time, but could it be something more serious?

When we have anxiety, it always seems like something serious, something dangerous enough to cause death.

One curious thing is that one of these days I did exercises to speed up my heart on purpose and see if it would ""calm down"", I drank calming tea before going to bed and I didn't have an attack, I slept well all night that day, but could it really have been related?

I don't know what it could be and I don't know what to do anymore, I need help, because I've been afraid to sleep, I've lost the will to live and make my dreams come true, because it seems like this never ends.

I was in a constant spiral and could only watch series throughout the day (i couldnt even watch certain series i used to watch without a problem before because of violent scenes that would send me into a full spiral which never happened before). They slowly subsided after around 2,5 weeks and now I ""only"" deal with light sensitivity, jitters and heart palpitations (my pulse is somewhere around 95-100 most of the time). My therapist told me that 25mg is way too small of a dosage to actually feel any improvements in mood or taking the edge off the ocd/overthinking/catastrophising which is mostly the reason for my attacks. My problem is that I dont know if Im able to go through another 2 weeks of side effects again and am worried of the 50mg also not helping...

1kw3ji1,Cycle of panic,"I’ve been having a really rough month and 3 weeks of on and off panic attacks. Has anyone else gone through something similar? 

Sorry for the long read. I’ve been on the lowest dose of Xanax up to two times a day as needed for anxiety off and on since the end of 2021 when I went to the hospital for a panic attack. After being hospitalized I came off of my abilify and lamotrigine and then was just on Xanax for the better part of the last 2.5 years. I wasn’t even taking it every day sometimes at all in a week but I was stable with my moods and it helped tremendously with my panic attacks/anxiety when I needed it. I had a couple months last year from feb- april 2024 where my refills ran out and I didn’t take it at all. End of April 2024 after being sick and having migraine flare ups and sciatic flare up, I went into a panic thinking I was dying. I decided to make a psych app and got my Xanax refilled for 6 months. I took it as needed for about a year. I ran out of refills again in March of this year and my psych won’t prescribe any more. I changed dr due to insurance and my psych now can’t prescribe Xanax. At the end of April this year, same thing, I started to get extremely fatigued and felt spacey, almost like I was dissociating and nothing felt real, I felt stuck in my head. Through all my anxiety and panic attacks I’ve never felt this before and I convinced myself something was medically wrong. This lasted about 2 weeks and then I actually got sick with an ear infection and common cold, felt better for a few days knowing I was fine and then I woke up out of my sleep one night sweating and having to catch my breath, I then went into a full blown panic attack and the health anxiety started to hit hard. I was able to calm myself down about an hour later but ever since then I’ve been feeling fine for a few days then it just hits me like a brick again, the tingling, the constant moving around, the overall feeling of panic and then I go into these days long episodes of feeling like I’m not real and I end up having a panic attack. I had a psych appointment and she put me on gabapentin 100mg twice a day as she can’t prescribe Xanax. I ended up finding a Xanax from my last prescription in one of my pill cases the other day and took the last one, I felt completely back to norm for me and the next day was great like nothing ever happened. The following night I took the gabapentin for the first time and felt fine, woke up yesterday, took it again as prescribed and got so much done with no pain or anything it was amazing relief and then this morning when I woke up I felt anxious. I’ve been on the verge of a panic attack again all day it just seems like maybe the meds are making it not be able to fully become a panic attack but I still have the feeling of being on edge or on the verge of one. I don’t know what to do at this point and I feel like the cycle of panic attacks I’ve been having came out of nowhere and I’m worried I’ll feel this way forever. ",1748288547.0,panicdisorder

1kvt18y,"Everything, All at Once","**Everything, All at Once: A Gestalt View on Burnout, Anxiety, and Depression**

Sometimes what we call anxiety is a body stuck in the future. Burnout? A self, stretched too thin for too long. Depression? A heaviness from losing touch with desire, with meaning. But in Gestalt work, we don’t rush to separate them. We look at what’s happening *now*…the confusion, the numbness, the inner tug-of-war, and we ask, *what part of you isn’t being heard?* These experiences often arrive together. Not because something is “wrong,” but because something *needs attending to.* And when we try to fix one in isolation, we miss the way they speak to each other. You might feel wired and flat at the same time. Tired but unable to stop. Wanting change but too foggy to move. That contradiction doesn’t need to be solved; it needs to be *witnessed.* The goal isn’t to diagnose what’s broken. It’s to stay present with what’s alive. Even confusion is contact. Even hopelessness carries information. So, we stay with it, slow down and listen. Not to chase a cure, but to invite wholeness back in.

What part of you have you been ignoring just to keep going?

1kvgnnp,Vacation Hell?,"For context, I’ve struggled with GAD, panic disorder and agoraphobia my entire life. I’ve always known anxiety and it’s nothing foreign to me at all. A few years ago, I chickened out of a vacation and couldn’t bring myself to get on the plane at the airport. 

This weekend was my first trip solo, I got on a plane all by myself for a dear friend that we were celebrating, and as much as I didn’t want to travel at because it’s such a trigger for me—I did it! I was so proud of myself for completing such a big thing. And I really wanted my friend who is very familiar with my anxiety to be proud of be. 

However, when I got to our destination, the whole weekend was chaos for me internally. LOTS of constant panic and anxiety attacks with very few moments of calm. I was in a very hot, crowded place and this is not my normal. I got myself through the weekend, 3 nights and 2 days, I did leave a day early because I just felt too overwhelmed and yearned for calm again so so badly. 

I do have to travel again soon (flights, hotel, etc.) in about two months for a wedding. I’m trying to focus on the win of the weekend, which is that I did it and I masked my anxiety really well and did my very best. I feel my friend is disappointed I struggled so badly with it and left one day early, which kills me.

I haven’t really gone far from home since my panic disorder has become so prominent just because I realize and know it’s a trigger and I thought this trip could be great exposure therapy, which I always make myself do. 

But the entire weekend my body stayed tense and my heart raced, I constantly felt overheated and hot, my limbs felt tingly and numb. It was just one big adrenaline rush that I couldn’t stop. I barely slept or ate, I felt so incredibly panicked the entirety of it.

Does anyone else struggle with this? How do you get through this without losing yourself in a bad cycle of panic? I’m currently home and still recovering mentally and physically, I still don’t feel entirely myself and am still very on edge. ",1748217432.0,panicdisorder

1kuqju0,Medication,"I’ve struggled off and on with panic disorder for about 20 years. I was put on medication for it about 11 years ago. That’s when my panic spiraled and turned into agoraphobia and things got really bad! 

I started with Celexa for a few years which worked great, but then changed to Lexapro because I just felt like my body was getting used to it and I was having some breakthrough symptoms. After I had a baby in 2020, I switch to Zoloft because it felt like the Lexapro stopped working and my anxiety and OCD were out of control! I also added Buspar. I have always had lorazepam as a “just in case” to take during an actual panic attack but never took it daily.

Well, at the end of February I had two panic attacks in a week that threw me back into a horrible anxious/panic spiral. I have been literally fighting for my life back since then. My doctor changed my medication to Prozac which I took for about 3 weeks before I had to stop because I was starting to get very depressed with no relief from anxiety. We decided to go back to where I started and take Celexa again (along with buspar this time). I worked up to 40mg but was having worsening symptoms so I backed off to 30 mg which seemed to do the trick! I was also taking lorazepam at bedtime for sleep. For 2 weeks I felt like myself again and I was really thinking this was the medicine for me. 

Well, at the begging of this week I had a panic attack that I just couldn’t seem to shake. That sent me into a spiral and now I’m have daily panic attacks with urges to just avoid anything because I feel so awful and scared all day long. In all the years I’ve struggled, this has been the most panic attacks I’ve ever had. I feel hopeless and trapped and like things are never going to get better. 

My question is, what medication has helped you the most? I just feel like I can’t find what works the best for me. I am in therapy with someone who specializes in anxiety and OCD. We are working on exposure therapy and acceptance therapy but I really feel like the meds play a huge part in me recovering from this! ",1748135005.0,panicdisorder

Tomorrow I go up to 50mg lamictal and I’m so nervous because I am finally starting to feel somewhat normal.

Okay, back story: From 2020-2023 I took 100mg of Zoloft everyday for my anxiety and depression. Worked great with very little side effects except headaches! They were horrible. Life got better- so I went off of it. Was fine until life went crazy again. So I went to the doctor and they gave me Zoloft again… I had THE WORST side effects, and it just really was not working at all for me and I felt like it honestly made my depression worse. It made my panic attacks worse I was literally having to take an Ativan to get through my days. So I went to a psychiatrist and she suggested I try adding lamictal to it. At first I didn’t really think it was helping but it definitely has - depression is way less intense and anxiety has calmed down some. Still pretty anxious most days though. I’m diagnosed with depression & anxiety, panic disorder, and PTSD.

1ktyle7,need help/slight victory,"TLDR; I started lexapro on tuesday and ended up having the worst possible panic attack and have not been the same since. I cant eat, force myself to oversleep all day all night and its just back to back horrid panic attacks. i am scared to be alone.
(if anyone does respond to this, pls do not mention anything harmful ab vaping, i just need reassurance about everything else. Also, no i will not be going to a mental hospital bc all of them near me have 1-2 star reviews full of abuse, SA and so much more.)

Hello, So on tuesday, i begged my doctor to put me back on lexapro after being on it all of 2024, but got off due to weight gain, brain fog, bad dreams, all the affects. I wanted to get back on it bc she wouldnt prescribe me anything else until i got a psychiatrist (june 1st) and my panic has been bad especially on car rides and after starting a new job (i ended up quitting).

I took 10 mg on tuesday and immediately felt like i couldnt breathe bc i started to starve. i think this triggered something in me bc i struggle with my weight bc of lexapro and it just brought back bad habits of feeling starved after just eating. I ran to the bathroom to put cold water on my face and looked into the mirror and my pupils shot big as hell. I ran downstairs and freaked out to my mom. Long story short, i felt like i had a psychotic break, INSANE mania and derealization and just the most traumatizing panic attack ive ever had. It ended in the whole household getting involved, my bf coming over and me swimming in the bathtub fully clothed eating pizza just trying to be okay. I barely ate said pizza and kept trying to make myself throw up out of fear of it getting worse or serotonin syndrome.

Since then, i have not been able to shower alone, i have to bathe in a bikini with my mom nearby. I can barely eat anything at all and have just been filling myself with melatonin so i can nap anytime i feel a panic attack. My body has been deteriorating and has been so tense. Ive had to go to my grandmas everyday now while my mom works bc i am so scared to be alone. My bf has enough going on as well and i feel like a burden towards everyone, so my grandma has just been my go to bc shes always been my safe place.


Yesterday, i ended up in the ER bc i just couldnt stop and felt like i couldnt breathe to where my body started shaking, vibrating and getting lightheaded. They didnt do anything for me besides check my heart rate and blood pressure which i thankfully do not know the numbers and my lungs. I keep spiraling about my breathing bc i vape and i saw a tiktok a few weeks ago about how those who have been vaping, once they hit 30-40, it will feel like breathing through a straw. i have been wanting to quit, but keep trying to find the “perfect time”, but my mind kept telling me it was happening now at 20 years old. The er doctor told me to look into cbd and that my lungs were fine and clear. 
EDIT- i have talked to my doctor about everything and she said she doesnt know why this all happened besides my body fighting it. chat gpt said the seratonin shift messed with me and overthinking it. Also that lexapro does have mania side effects including the pupils. 

Now for the slight victory- i have been prescribed just hydroxzyne, but i have not taken it out of fear. I have NOT taken the lexapro again. I started ashgwanda and melatonin with chamomile+lavender yesterday. I was able to lay out in the sun for a good 30 minutes today. I took only one nap today. I did panic but not any fear of dying ones. i cried a lot, but i also was able to eat a good enough meal. I was able to wash my hair in the bath today without supervision as well. Ive been practicing battling negative thoughts and delusions today and i feel a bit more hopeful.

-i generally have a fear of being trapped that triggers panic.  Imits not so much closed spaces, it's moreso not having a way out, cus whenever I have had panic attacks in the past the one thing that helped was to pace and walk, and when Im in a plane or a train or something I feel trapped and like if I have an attack I have nowhere to go

-turbulence and the general movement of the aircraft just makes me feel disoriented and uncomfortable.  I know that turbulence is not particularly dangerous, but just feeling like I'm tilting around and stuff makes me feel disoriented and panicked.

I'm a 22-year-old female who's been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder for about four years now.

I’ve tried a few SSRIs in the past and gave each one a fair shot, but unfortunately, none of them worked for me. I’ve also taken hydroxyzine, ramelteon, and Klonopin (not all at once), but Klonopin was the only one that truly helped.

I just moved to a new city and, honestly, I feel completely overwhelmed. It feels like I’ll never get back to feeling like myself again. My new psychiatrist just prescribed Effexor, deciding to try the SNRI route instead of another SSRI.

Naturally, I spiraled into a rabbit hole of posts and videos about Effexor…and most of what I’ve seen has been pretty negative. I know people are more likely to post bad experiences than good ones, but it’s definitely freaking me out.

What worries me the most is the possibility of it making me feel even worse, especially in these first few weeks. I'm also really scared about the withdrawal side of things if it doesn’t work out. I’m in such a fragile place right now, and I honestly don’t know if I can handle feeling worse before (or if) I feel better.

So, my question is: What was your experience with Effexor like? Was it helpful? Did it make things worse? And if it worked for you, when did you start to feel okay again? I just don’t know what to expect.

I’m agoraphobic and emetophobic (and a C-PTSD sufferer due to the abuse from my parents), so I’ve struggled greatly with leaving the house and eating but since the beginning of this year it’s in overdrive and making me scared of anything and everything. Too scared to leave the house, too scared to eat (I just nibble snacks during the day and try not to panic because every time I eat my anxiety is convinced I’ll be sick because of said anxiety though I’ve not been sick since I was a very small child), too scared to leave my room to go to the bathroom, scared of night, day, changes in weather, absolutely everything. Even things in TV shows I watch can be triggering when they weren’t triggering before this point. I can’t work because my mental health is very poor, I’m always holed up at home constantly anxious from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep. Even when there’s nothing technically to be anxious about.

Though, the current thing I’ve been dreading is my dad’s new partner visiting for a week (didn’t know she existed until a few days ago at which point dad had been seeing her for 7 months). This visit was arranged without asking me how I even felt about it what with all my social anxiety and it’s happening in two weeks. I tend to starve myself whenever family come for the day (this is my strategy for anything I dread, when I used to be able to leave the house I’d starve myself before that too) and eat after they’ve left, but this is far too much for me to handle, I’m very scared of strangers. Since I learned about this visit two days ago I’ve completely broken down. I’m barely able to eat or sleep, I’m anxious and terrified all the time and there’s no telling what will set me off into full blown panic. 

I’m so beyond terrified of everything I literally can’t do anything but sit in my room and stew. I feel like a tiny little kid scared of everything all the time and I don’t even know why.

Hi I’m new to this sub, needed a outlet to rant + ask opinions on medication. I was diagnosed with GAD and Panic Disorder co-occurring with bipolar disorder 10 years ago when I was 12. It unfortunately wasn’t a misdiagnosis as all my following psychiatrist came to the same conclusion. 
I’ve been on more medications than I can count. Prozac, Lexapro, Paxil, risperidone, seroquel, lithium, ability, Wellbutrin, gabapentin, buspar and more. 
Some of these have actually helped with my mood and eased my depressive episodes, but that’s not my main concern. It’s the debilitating panic attacks. 
I can’t go anywhere without worry, I can’t function normally because even if I’m not having a random panic attack I’m scared about the next one. There is no specific trigger they happen at home or outside out of no where. I’ve seen multiple therapists and two psychologists. Yes I’ve learned some ways to slightly calm myself from them. Though that still entails being practically a vegetable for almost an hour at least. It’s no way to live and the quality of life sucks. 
The only medication that has reliably brought me back to earth is alprazolam. Although 1. My doctors have been actively trying to reduce my script. 2. Have never given me a dose higher than .25mg (It helps but doesn’t eliminate it). 3.  Are dedicated to fixing me by different means. 
I’m only 22, so I assume they are afraid to fry my brains. But for gods sake I want more benzos not less. I have read all the medical journals I know the studies. I couldn’t care less about long term effects, my quality of life sucks and I’d kill for a longer acting benzo to take forever. Maybe I wouldn’t have to and my brain would chill out over time, but if I did I’d prefer that over what is going on now. Everytime I’ve brought it up I get shut down because I’m so young and “I want to try this first”. Well it’s been a fuck ton of time and my quality of life  still sucks. 
I get they don’t wanna kill my brain, but why do they act so nonchalant about prescribing every antipsychotic/ssri under the sun. Only to treat benzos like the plague. 
Not to mention they decide Xanax is okay even though it is probably the worst benzo given it’s short acting ability which commonly leads to having a follow up panic attack.
I’ve advocated for myself for years. Especially this last year. Give me Valium or Klonopin and fuck off. I’ve tried so much and I’ve had a fucked life the entire time. Give me peace please. I can’t take it and I don’t know how to get someone to listen to me.",1747781709.0,panicdisorder

1kpykwc,Some encouragement,"In my time in university (age 18-23) I struggled with panic disorder in a way that made me think I would never be able to live a normal life. My panic disorder caused me to believe that I was going to throw up and/ or faint when I did pretty much anything. At its worst, I couldn’t leave the house to grocery shop, I couldn’t work a job that involved interacting with the public, I couldn’t go to class - even the smallest tasks felt like huge challenges because of how dysregulated I was all the time. 

I’m making this post because I know how devastating this disorder can be, and I know how overwhelming and helpless it can make you feel. I used to read this subreddit regularly, looking for a glimmer of hope that I wouldn’t have to live that way forever. I now know how it feels to get better, and if sharing that can give even one person some hope I think it’s worthwhile.

When I graduated, I moved home and decided I needed to focus on my mental health. I got prescribed trintellix, a drug which has been a miracle for me. (Worth noting that I have tried just about every drug under the sun starting at age 15) Trintellix allowed me to get to a point where I could be receptive to CBT, which has also helped me greatly. If you are on the fence about taking medication, or feel as though the medication you are on isn’t working, I encourage you to talk to your doctor. 
I’m 25 now and I am able to do things that I never thought I would. I still struggle, but I don’t live in constant fear and I feel hopeful for the future. My life has improved so dramatically in the last two years, it sometimes brings me to tears.
My heart goes out to anyone struggling with this cruel disorder, but I hope that reading this can be a bit of encouragement to keep fighting and trying new ways to feel better.

1kpygnk,Exposure therapy?,"Hi everyone, I’m currently in a really bad state panic wise lately. My absolute main trigger is driving over bridges (which I HAVE to do everyday to get to work, I live in a coastal town and it’s the only way to get there) I keep getting panicked and dizzy, I keep forcing myself to drive over them though. My psychiatrist told me I have to keep forcing myself over them and exposing myself to it. My question is, how is exposure therapy supposed to work for me if the part I’m scared of is passing out from a panic attack while driving. I never feel better after every time I drive over it. It honestly gets worse and worse because I anticipate the panic. I know the whole thing to exposure therapy is to completely submit to the panic and feel it, but I don’t understand how I’m supposed to do that when I’m trying to safely operate a car and NOT pass out from panic. It’s gotten to the point where I have to make my bf ride in the car with me everytime I drive over the bridge, thankfully we live together and work together so this is not an issue… BUT I want to be able to handle it on my own and I just don’t understand how.

1kp9qb4,Looking for hope.,"Sorry in advance for the long post, just getting extremely frustrated and need to vent. I've been dealing with Panic attacks and some level of Agoraphobia/autophobia since covid, I had one bad panic attack right before shut-down and then didn't leave the house for a few months because my job was non-essential. I had varying levels of anxiety before that and some travel anxiety but it was more manageable./

tl;dr: I've had panic attacks and anxiety for going on 15 years, that escalated to agoraphobia and autophobia post covid. Tried several medications, semi-open to trying more, recently became unemployed and spiraled for a while. Feeling somewhat better now but looking for other's success stories and medication journeys with similar triggers. I don't believe that I am depressed but I do get disheartened by what I've lost to these issues./

I tried CBT from 2021-23 but I don't think I was ready or willing to do the necessary steps of exposure. I have tried SSRI's (Lexapro and Zoloft) and felt nothing other than sexual side effects, I tried both for several months. I take .25 mg Xanax as needed but I try to avoid that as much as possible (I just had a bunch expire before recent issues led me to renew my rx.) I am also on Buspirone 30 mg twice daily which I don't think is doing anything in all honesty, but I've convinced myself it is. I recently tried an SNRI (Pristiq 25 mg) for 3 weeks and that made my anxiety Much worse, I had also left my job ""temporarily"" around that same time so things spiraled about a month ago./

I recently started seeing a new therapist, she seems very confident in her ability to rid me of my panic attacks, but things are off to a slow start. I'm getting very frustrated and need to get back to work. Her confidence has given me increased confidence, but she was on vacation this week so I'm just stewing in my emotions./

My main trigger for my panic attacks is that I feel like I can't breathe or catch my breath. Logically I know that breathing is involuntary, but any noticeable change in my breathing when I'm not at home or I'm alone and I go into a panic attack. The other symptoms are there, rapid heartbeat, tingling, tension, but sometimes I can work through those. Has anyone had this exact trigger and found a way to overcome it?/

Has anyone tried the meds that I listed and found something after that worked? I don't love the idea of SNRI's right now because of my bad experience with Pristiq./

Recently, back in march, I woke up feeling like my body was being pulled down to the right and had other issues that severely triggered my health anxiety. I have been to the emergency room twice since then and have had numerous doctors appointments trying to figure out what's wrong with me.

Now, since that day in march, nothing has felt real, but has also felt extremely real at the same time. Sometimes it feels like I'm going to be ""unplugged"", almost like my vision disappears but doesn't go away. Along with this, I have started to decode things in my head to the extreme. Like, when I see people in a store instead of thinking ""oh its people in a store"" I think to myself ""Oh, we're all animals basically hunting and gathering on a planet that we just so happened to inhabit"" and it freaks me out.

I also have been having trouble with making myself believe that I can feel the earth rotating (extreme vertigo), and that if I'm outside for too long that I'm going to fall into the sky.

1kn217y,should I go on this trip?,"TLDR at the bottom. This turned into me venting because I feel like I have nobody left to talk to about this that understands me. So sorry this is long.

Hello. I have panic disorder and within the past year it has made me borderline agoraphobic. Distance from home scares me and sets me off. I have needed to take my (as needed) klonopin more often than I ever have in these years I have had the disorder. I also do not do well with any type of change, especially to my routine.

I am currently in plans to take a trip to Florida which is 5 US states away from where I live. This trip will be with my dad, his long term girlfriend, her son and his gf, my older sister and her husband and kids, my teenage sister, and my girlfriend and I. Sorry if that is a lot. For more context I have had an extremely difficult relationship with my dad/his girlfriend + her family until these past few years when my nephew and niece were born and I didn’t want to miss out on seeing them grow up just bc I held a grudge w my dad.

That being said, ever since I became disabled with panic disorder (and yes I do mean disabled this has completely changed my life and I am now on SSDI with a part time job) my dad and his gf havent acted rude or mean toward me with my episodes but they definitely do not understand it and mostly just look at me with pity, like I have failed as an adult which I already feel much of the time. They don’t make me feel safe and secure. They are just paying for me and my gf to go on this trip with them.

The only person who makes me feel safe and secure is my mom, who obviously will not be going on this trip. My girlfriend does not make me feel safe and secure bc I feel like I am the responsible adult in our relationship. I am the one who handles things and she always needs help with stuff, always has questions, etc. I have told her this and she is empathetic but I do not inherently trust her to know what to do if something were to happen to me. I don’t even know what to do if something were to happen, so it’s not like I can tell her exactly what to do. She has told me she personally sought advice from my mother and when she did it nothing helped, but when my mom did the same thing it worked. So I think it is a trust thing.

My panic attacks cause severe episodes of derealization that have in the past sent me into psychosis. Psychosis is the scariest thing I have ever experienced and that is what I fear the most bc it can happen time and time again.

I have told my mom and sisters that I do not know what I should do when it comes to this trip. Everyone has told me I should go, that my mom is only a phone call away, that realistically what can she do in person that’s different than over the phone, that my anxiety is holding me back, etc. I feel like they just aren’t hearing me. I have mulled over this for several weeks now as my trip is in June. 

Idk if I should go. I love the beach and my state does not have any type of beach. I want to feel the sun on my skin and put my feet in the ocean. I want to take a cool shower after a long hot day on the beach and snuggle into clean sheets. I want to watch my little niece and nephew see the ocean for the first time, they are finally at an age where we can directly communicate and their imaginations are at an all time high. I want to smell like tanning lotion and put my waterproof gold jewelry to use. 

But I don’t want to panic. I don’t want to fly. I don’t want to lose my mind several states away. We aren’t staying in a house close to the beach so I would have to rely on my dad to take me there so it would be on their schedule not mine. I don’t want to be at dinner in a busy restaurant and go into full derealization mode. I don’t want to be stuck doing something bc his gf kids always gets priority when it comes to picking an activity or such. I don’t want to have to be locked away in my room crying on the phone to my mom as I desperately wait for the klonopin to kick in. 

My last vacation with my dad was last year and I was horribly anxious the whole time. And we drove there I didn’t have to fly. As soon as we arrived to the house I knew it was a mistake and panicked. 

What a nightmare to have a panic attack while trapped on an airplane. How humiliating. The last place I want to go into psychosis is thousands of miles away from my home, from my safe space, surrounded by people who Just Don’t Get It. 

I don’t know what to do. I think me feeling like I have missed out may be the better outcome than going and it be horrible. But I also feel horribly guilty about the money they spent on me and my girlfriend’s plane tickets and housing costs. Also the fact I’m denying my girlfriend of a trip too if I do not go.

I need advice from people who understand my fears. From people who understand it’s not just anxiety. Plus if any of you have done something similar.

TLDR: Idk if I should go to florida (several states away) on an airplane with my dad and his family that I am extremely distanced from aka do not feel safe to be vulnerable around. I love the beach but hate everything else about this trip. I am scared to fly and feel trapped on an airplane. I am scared I will panic and spiral into derealization then psychosis, thousands of miles away from home. I do not want to feel trapped for a week then have to fly home on top of everything.

I’ve been on sertraline for almost a year now, and while I think I’ve being doing exceptionally well in terms of everyday living, travel is still at the top of my “avoid at all costs” list. I know I should be embracing the panic and not letting it get in the way of what non-anxious me would do, but it’s so difficult!!! I’m worried I’ll have constant panic attacks or even get so bad I can’t leave and come back home at the end of my trip. I’m aware this is not reality and also highly unlikely, but I can’t help fixating on these thoughts. 

There’s no real question here, just looking for some kind words and reassurance x

1km6imz,"Xanax, does it help?","Hi there. So I have been going through a rather unexpected and brutal panic disorder flare up over the past several months. I deal with panic disorder, OCD, and severe anxiety. I honestly have the best doctor in the world, she listens, and I feel like she actually cares. Today, I finally asked for a PRN medication for when the panic attacks are unmanageable. I have been prescribed Xanax before but this was years ago. I’m have medication anxiety and often don’t take it other than the meds that I am currently on, which is buspar 3x/day and Tylenol (literally the only two things I take because.. anxiety/fear). 

My question is, how is Xanax for you if you take it? It’s a super small dose, 0.25mg which is all I asked for. But of course I’m in my head about it. Does it make you feel weird/dizzy/high blood r is it just enough to allow you to come down from immense panic and feel normal? Does it make you excessively tired? Or has any one had a bad experience with it? I’m just trying to figure my brain out and be better. Final semester of nursing school really took its toll on me I guess, and all that hard work has been compromised by panic and anxiety. 

Also, does anyone deal with constant dizziness? That’s been my new daily thing, especially on high anxiety days. And of course it only makes it worse. I’m just want to be better. 

Yes I’m in therapy. ",1747196905.0,panicdisorder

1kl0wxb,Panic relapse,"Hellooooo everyone, 
It’s been a while since I’ve posted in here. I’ve been doing really really good these last several months. I have been taking medication and honestly haven’t really dealt with much anxiety/panicky type feelings. 
However, the last few of days with today being the worst, I feel like my symptoms are starting to creep their way back in. 

Friday night I woke up and had the fast beating heart and night sweats, which used to happen every night. Yesterday I started getting random spurts of an elevated heart rate and feeling kinda sick to my stomach. Today I woke up and I felt okay at first but as the day has gone on, the worse I’m feeling. I just have this very uneasy/unwell feeling in my chest and stomach that isn’t going away. I feel like at any moment I’m going to start having a full blown panic attack. I have moments where I start feeling light headed and shaky. It seems to be coming and going in waves but overall I just feel super icky and weird. 

I started a new job three weeks ago (which I love so far) and unfortunately they have a very strict probation period for the first 6 months so I’m really not supposed to miss any work at all or I risk being fired. - a month ago if I would have felt like this, it would have sent me to the ER. I don’t like it. It’s been a few months since I’ve had icky feelings like this so it’s very hard for me to grasp whether this is just my anxiety/panic or if I should actually be concerned lol. 


For further context - over the last year I have wore a heart monitor three times and I’ve had an echocardiogram done. My heart looks perfectly healthy and my cardiologist says there’s no sign of anything bad happening to my heart or having a heart attack anytime in the next 10 years. I’ve had urine tests and blood tests.. no pheochromocytoma or anything found. My ANA is positive and my ESR was elevated so I saw a rheumatologist but my lupus tests came back negative. 
I’m supposed to be getting a tilt table test done next month because there is some issues with my blood pressure after laying down and standing up but honestly other than that.. my doctor thinks I’m in pretty good health. I’ve seen several doctors over the course of the past year and every single one of them is certain a lot of my issues stem from anxiety. 

Anyone else have panic relapse and if so, how did you handle it?? I spent a year really trying so hard to feel normal again and I really was at a point where I felt like I was actually getting better and I’d hate to fall back into this cycle. ",1747076617.0,panicdisorder

1kiua8u,Medicine induced Panic Di,"So I have always been an nervous/restless/anxious person. I used to have these sensations in my gut pretty much all day long. With time I became pretty skilled at just being with these sensations, not making much of a problem of them. At 27 I got my ADHD Combined form diagnosis so I decided to try meds because it could not hurt I thought? Noone informed me about potential future outcomes...After 15 minutes of my first Concerta dose it was like my usual gut feelings dissapeared...and was replaced with this mild chestpressure instead. Almost like my gut feelings moved/morphed to my chest somehow? Did not think much about it, was kinda cool to not have my usual nervousness etc...but at day 20 of Concerta I was leaving the gym and it was like this small pressure developed into a Elephant on my chest, almost crashed my car and had to knock on a strangers house and make them call an ambulance. I was sure I was having a heartattack and dying. That is 60 days ago and since that day I have had this almost permanent chestpressure and tons of panic attacks. I have been to the ER 3 times and they claim it is panic attacks. They have done ECG and bloodwork several times. They resist doing any other tests like X-ray etc. So I guess I just have to trust them now. I was afraid for a long time since these stimulants affect your heart and deaths etc have been reported because of them. How could I know it was panic attacks and not real heart attacks when I had been taking these meds? I had also been doing intense workouts combined with these stimulants...

I quitted Concerta and I thought I had been restored to my normal self but my usual stomach feelings had not returned. I decided to try Elvanse which I was offered, still afraid that the same stuff would happen tho. I was only on 30mg for 5 days and the chestpressure stayed. I have not taken any stimulants now for 34 days and still dont feel like my former self. I cant even exercise now and have a hard time even driving my car, since the chance is big they start an attack. Literally crippled because of these meds that were supposed to help me?

What the heck even happend? Im not getting any clear answers from my psychiatry...Its like my original emotions became physical on these meds? Literally have been hell this past time.

I have read that you should not take stimulants if you have severe anxiety or overactive thyroid. I have noticed now that my original bloodtests pre meds even showed signs of overactive thyroid, still they prescribed me this shit?!? What the? Annoyed, angry, afraid, sad, hopeless!

Ever since my surgery, I have NOT been able to sleep. I will fall asleep and wake up about every 20 minutes gasping for air and my heart racing. Then it will happen 2-4 more times until I finally fall asleep for the night. 

I’m not sure if subconsciously I’m worrying about my recovery from surgery, but I am starting to feel insane. I just want to sleep. I keep thinking I need to go to the ER but ultimately tell myself not to do it. But after 3 nights of this happening I don’t know what else to do.

Yesterday, I went to the rheumatologist for the first time because my doctors and I are investigating chronic symptoms. The appointment went fine and I liked the doctor. He ordered a bunch of tests and they went ahead and drew blood for them right there. Well. I have had an extreme phobia of needles since I was a child thanks to a bad pediatrician. I also have really deep veins that like to hide, especially when I’m anxious. I have done a lot of work to mitigate the panic when I have to give blood—especially since I am sick as shit and often have to have blood drawn. I have a system. But sometimes when it’s sprung on me it throws off my prep and increases my anxiety. I was trying my best to relax, but they were having a hard time with my vein and kept moving the needle around and it was taking FOREVER. I started to panic. I took some deep breathes and tried to keep it under control, but suddenly I got extremely sweaty and my vision narrowed to a pin prick as the room got super bright. Apparently I went to pale my lips were tiring purple, and my blood pressure drops to 51/30.

hi i am 20 F. I got my first panic attack in summer of 2023 and quit my job because of it in december 2023. I worked as a host in a restaurant for almost three years prior and it was my first job, until the panic started to associate with it. Id get extreme physical symptoms and derealization almost every shift.  Fast forward to now, i am unmedicated and was doing kinda well for what it was before. i was on lexapro all of 2024, but got off of it in December of 2024 bc of weight gain and fatigue. This whole time i have just missed my job and coworkers. Two weeks ago after some convincing of my old coworkers, i applied and interviewed. i had a silent panic attack through the interview and now my panic attacks are bad asf again every day following that interview. My first day is on Wednesday and i am terrified. I am spiraling so bad. I jumped on buspar almost two weeks ago but stopped taking it yesterday bc it made it so much worse. (ik i didnt give it time). I am really considering not going back anymore even tho its all i wanted, but now i dont because of this. Everyone keeps telling me it would be exposure therapy and it will help me back into the real world and thats true, but they dont fully get it. I am especially scared because if i do go and freak out and spiral again and leave, i feel like i will have just disappointed everyone and be embarrassed. I need to make a decision whether or not to actually go back, but i cant make decisions for shit. i lumped all these challenges together the last two weeks like finding a psychiatrist, getting on meds to possibly help, but its just made it worse. i wish i did all this sooner and had more time. Can someone give me an outsider view or tell me what to do? Also its all new management too, so they dont know about the panic attacks. 

btw if i were not to go back, id 100% get a slower paced job within this next month, possibly try new meds, get my psychiatrist and also quit vaping. I am scared to quit vaping while working bc of the spike in anxiety and sickness, so thats another factor.

1kecc60,called a tweaker; sh scar,"I don’t even know if this is a reasonable thing to be upset about but it’s been on my mind. Recently I had a close friendship end for a variety of reasons, coming a few months after I first developed panic disorder (but before I was diagnosed). It was probably for the best, as the relationship had become extremely codependent. However, she had taken to calling me a tweaker because my panic attacks cause repetitive behaviors such as rocking, teeth chattering, and hand movements. It didn’t bother me at first, and I even started to jokingly refer to the episodes as me “tweaking”. Another unfortunate side effect of my panic attacks before I started treatment was that I would pick at and scratch at my skin uncontrollably, leaving visible scabs on my hands and arms. At one point I probably had 15-20 active wounds. I’m left with scars that I’m fairly self-conscious of, but I’m unable to hide them due to the location. After being diagnosed, I was talking with some other friends about what was happening, and one of them mentioned jokingly that she was worried about being seen with me by her peers because I looked like a tweaker. I know it’s just a dumb joke that I probably encouraged in some ways, but it’s been stuck in my mind and I feel so sick when I think about it for too long. If this is what my closest friends think about me, what are other people thinking? I guess I’m wrapped up with the thought that I’ll always look like there’s something wrong with me. I don’t know.

My ears start ringing, I get insane panic attacks like the type where your body goes cold and you start shaking really bad and you wanna run outside and call an ambulance 

After doing some anxiety ridden research I found that I’m not alone. Histamine can and most likely will cause anxiety symptoms hence why so hydroxizine works so well to help people break a panic attack (you can’t have a panic attack when you’re in a coma) 

Today I took a Claritin, Nasal Spray, and a tablespoon or two of local honey and I’m starting to feel better yall

So if you’re feeling an uptick in symptoms you’re not alone and you’re not crazy.

I don’t know if it’s necessarily impending doom but that feels accurate I haven’t found anything better to explain other than a weird feeling of depression where I feel hopeless and like there is something to be afraid of. Also kind of feels like I shouldn’t be excited about stuff and just this extremely weird looming feeling comes over me and I try to distract myself. And when I try to self reflect and make sense of it I can’t. It almost maybe feels like the beginning of a panic attack like it could snowball into one if I let it. Idk if this makes any sense but I just want to know if anyone relates and what you guys have found that helps with it. ",1746147189.0,panicdisorder
1kcfmh3,Feeling much better,"Hello everyone. 
First off I hope you are doing good. 

For the past month I only had two panic attacks. Which is such a success for me, I used to have multiple panic attacks a day, literally rolling panic attacks that lasted for hours. 

I still have a lot to take care of but this now is much better than I would have ever thought. 
I can partly workout, I can drive my motorcycle in the wilderness. I can enjoy some days. 

Guess the key is to never give up, I tried a bunch of things and a lot of them didn’t work for me. I wanted to take care of this without coping mechanisms.

1kcblnb,Intrusive thoughts,"I've already made two posts about how I felt post my panic attack and most of the symptoms like derealisation/dissociation, 24/7 anxiety and trembling although not entirely gone but have gotten better except one which is intrusive thoughts. They make me second guess severything and constantly seek for reassurance whether I'm going insane or not. Example of these are ""what if I'm going crazy"", ""what if I lose control"", ""what if I now suddenly attack or hurt someone"". These thoughts freak me out and make me feel uneasy like something is genuinely wrong.

Is this common and how to cope with it?",1746113448.0,panicdisorder
1kcaidp,Is it panic disorder ?,"Since this question is asked very often in this community, we have decided to create a pinned post. These informations are taken from the most recent DSM-5.

Panic disorder is a serious mental health condition characterized by recurrent and unexpected panic attacks. These attacks are intense episodes of fear or discomfort that peak within minutes and include at least four of the following symptoms:

- Palpitations or accelerated heart rate  
- Sweating  
- Trembling or shaking  
- Muscle tension or muscle weakness 
- Shortness of breath or feeling smothered  
- Feeling of choking  
- Feeling of lump in the throat (globus sensation)
- Chest pain or discomfort  
- Nausea, dry mouth, abdominal distress, and (rarely) vomiting
- Dizziness, light-headedness, or (rarely) fainting  
- Chills or heat sensations  
- Numbness, tingling, or burning sensations  
- Feelings of unreality or detachment from oneself
- High sensitivity to sounds, light, touch, etc.
- Feeling of impending doom 
- Fear of losing control or ""going crazy""  
- Fear of dying or having a medical emergency 

To meet the criteria for panic disorder, at least one panic attack must be followed by **persistent worry** about having more attacks or their consequences, or a **maladaptive change in behavior** aimed at avoiding situations that might trigger an attack.

While this post provides information about panic disorder, it’s important to note that **only a qualified mental health professional** can provide an accurate diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment. 

As fellow Redditors, we’re here to support and share experiences, but we’re not trained or equipped to make diagnoses or provide professional advice. If you think you might have panic disorder, we encourage you to seek professional help.

I can't be away from a hospital, I'm afraid to eat in case of an allergic reaction ( never had one), and some days I can't get out of bed for fear of panic but if I try to sleep I wake up in panic. 
I got on Lexapro a year and a half ago and it was a life saver. All the intrusive what if thoughts quieted down and it slowed down my thoughts. I was starting to function again.

First day of 50mg with a direct switch from 17.5 mg Lexapro I felt good, but after a week of the Lexapro getting out of my system my anxiety got worse with more intrusive thoughts. It wrecked my stomach for a good two weeks along with having a foggy head.  Since anxiety didn't improve after a month I went to 100mg. I'm at 4 weeks today at this dose.

Still though, my anxiety seems so bad that I didn't want to go to work today. I had to call my grandmother to sit with me just to get through the day (I know crazy, I wish I didn't). Emailed my doctor and he said go up to 150mg... Anyone not feel much improvement until they went up to 150mg?

1k7vqbg,Are the medicines working,"Hey everyone.
I’ve been struggling with panic and a lot of mixed anxiety symptoms lately, and I just needed to talk to people who get it.

A few years ago, I was on Lexapro but stopped it without my therapist’s advice. After that, I was actually doing okay—barely had symptoms and lived pretty normally. But starting last month, the panic attacks and anxiety have come back every single day, and it's been overwhelming.

Right now, I’m back on Lexapro (10mg) and have been taking it for about 15 days, but I haven’t noticed any real improvement yet. I was also prescribed Bromazepam 1.5mg this past Monday to help with sleep, and it has helped me get some rest, which I’m grateful for.

But an hour ago, I was just playing Counter-Strike on my PC with cousins and friends when I suddenly felt chest pain, and some tingling in my left arm and panic hit me hard. The fight-or-flight reaction seems to have calmed down, but I’m still feeling this soreness and discomfort in my chest, the left arm tingling is gone as I lay in bed. It’s so frustrating and scary.

I’ve become afraid of doing basic things—driving, getting in a car, even just leaving the house to work sometimes. I know these meds take time, but I’m just wondering… when does Lexapro usually start working for you? And do these chest pains and physical symptoms go away with time?

It's been roughly 6 months since I was diagnosed, and I genuinely want to help all of you with the road to recovery and what recovery might look like by sharing my experience

(sorry for poor grammar)

First month:   
I had severe panic attacks (PAs) every single day, multiple times a day. Usually, I could not sleep as I'd be woken up out of it by a PA. I could barely walk, was constantly dizzy, didn't really attend school, and my grades were slipping. I was in and out of hospitals due to fear, and all of my favorite activities were ceased indefinitely. I especially could not talk during a PA. I always tried to fight it and lost. There were little to no wins during this time, and It got so bad I thought about getting a wheelchair.  
  
Second-Third months:  
Medium PA every day. Severe ones happened, but not as frequently. My sleep was still being harshly interrupted. I started therapy around the end of the third month and could barely walk during my PAs. I had a good sense of knowing when I was about to have one, yet my coping mechanisms from my therapist weren't working. While I was going back to school, my favorite activities were still largely stopped due to the frequency of my PAs. I started to gain confidence in my disorder and joke about it here and there, but the depression was still severe. Here is where I started to post the most on this subreddit because aiding people with their Panic Disorder (PD) made me feel better and more familiar. I took my first walk outside during the end of the second month, it caused a PA, but I was so proud of myself for doing it.  
  
Fourth-Fifth months:  
I started to do my favorite things again (like taking a walk, going to the park, etc) and started deep breathing and accepting my PAs when they happened instead of brushing them off as my therapist recommended. I accepted who I was, found social media accounts that talk about PD, and forgave myself for experiencing what I do. I also wrote an essay on PD and won a scholarship for the college I'm about to be enrolled in! My life is not completely normal still, but I feel like myself and no longer consider PD as something that can hold me back. If I have a PA, I have a PA, I will get over it.  
  
Sixth month:  
I'm fully back to myself besides riding rollercoasters. I'm in control of my own body and started to exercise again. While I do still have PA symptoms (like gasping, feeling heavy, or dizzy), I cannot remember when I've had a severe panic attack. I have small panic attacks that are symptoms only maybe every 3 days (I'm going through a stressful situation) but they're not something I worry about at all because I know no matter what they can't kill me. I'm also swimming again and back to having my personality as it was before.   
Now, if I have anxiety (like when I'm about to do a public speech or act) my heart rate shoots up and the mini PAs are there, but I breathe it out and keep going even if it feels like I'm about to faint. I push through and acknowledge it afterward and feel better.  
Infact, I feel those mini PAs as I'm typing right now!!!!   
Things do get better, and within the next 2 months, I'm sure I'll feel even greater

I know i have panic disorder but I was just a wreck for weeks not being able to sleep properly, not being able to eat, losing weight rapidly because of this. Anyway, I had my upper endoscopy yesterday and I was SO afraid to get sedated as its not just a little sedation they are going to really get you ""high"" (the clinic i went to does not offer anesthesia)  i hate that feeling and I hate not having control, so I talked to them when I got there and I said I do not want to be sedated and they were really confused. I told them about my anxiety and they were just like.... wouldn't you want to be sedated so you dont feel or see it??? And then I explained my fear and they were still kind of like you should take it but if you dont want to then you do not have to. By the way I am NOT scared of not being able to breathe and idk why I just am not. Probably has to do with having 2 collapsed lungs at one point in my life so I got use to barely being able to breathe lol. Anyway I did the endoscopy without the sedation and it really isn't that bad, it is pretty uncomfortable but I mean there's a tub down your throat so what do you expect. The pain is very much tolerable it doesn't hurt. The air being pushed into your stomach is uncomfortable because it makes you feel like you have to throw up but if you just let yourself burp its alright. 
I am having my colonoscopy next week and from what ive read I believe I will also go with no sedation. I will update you guys about my decision after the operation but I am not as afraid anymore considering my upper endoscopy was pretty clean. They found some inflammation in my stomach lining matching with gastritis but thats alright at least I know why I was sick for a while for the most part.

What do I do? This isn’t a life worth living. I’m stuck on Effexor and Klonopin because getting off makes me panic 24/7. I’ve been sober for 12 years and I don’t see the point anymore.

1k594y8,panic disorder diagnosis,"hello everyone! 

  
i've been having panic attacks for the majority of my life, but it was always rather manageable and i was able to navigate through them. however, a couple days ago, one of them started, and it just would not stop for about an hour. i caved and asked to be taken to the ER. thankfully it was empty, and the staff were all great. they took my BP, i had a chest xray, ECG and bloodwork done. the oxymeter showed my oxygen at 99. everything else came back normal, too. so, they said it is most likely purely panic. they gave me 0.25mg xanax, along with some inhalation meds via nebulizer. 

the very next day, i started suffering again from the moment i woke up, so we called a psychiatrist for an in home visit. he diagnosed me with panic disorder and prescribed a higher dose of xanax for daily use. told me that i wont be taking it for long, because i will need to start antidepressants. but i can take it while they're starting to kick in. 

the way my panic attacks present is this: i can breathe through my nose just fine, but for whatever reason, i feel like its... not enough? so i want to breathe via my mouth, a deep inhale. but i cant, and it leaves me feeling breathless... this heavy feeling in my chest. feels like impending doom. i start feeling i will faint. i try to remain as still as possible to catch my breath, the slightest visual/sound stimuli overwhelms me. feels like its just me in a dark room trying to survive. 

so, i finally decided to ask for help. because i want my life back, without this feeling of being trapped. these past few days i developed a fear of going outside. that has never happened before. i still do it though, 3x daily. i have a dog i need to care for and whom i love dearly. i want to get better for him and for myself. the poor guy got so scared that i left so suddenly and in such a rush. 

besides medication and talk therapy, what else has worked for you? i would love to hear some suggestions on some exercises i can do to help myself. i will be seeing a psychiatrist regularly starting tomorrow, but i would love to hear what helps other sufferers.

1k4uxey,Hoping to help someone!,"My panic disorder started six years ago after the sudden and traumatic loss of my mom—I was the one who found her. It’s like that one singular event triggered what was always lurking. It began subtly with dizziness while driving, almost like I was floating out of my seat. That sensation of depersonalization quickly became more physical. My hands would tingle, go numb, and even cramp up in what I later found out (when I enrolled in nursing school) is called “trousseau’s sign.” Over time, the symptoms spread: my legs would go numb, my face too. I’d get tunnel vision, and more recently, I started experiencing eye and lip twitching, intense pressure in my head, and ringing in my ears. I thought I was having a stroke or that I was going to faint. It has happened while walking or sitting down in class on the 7th floor (heights randomly trigger it, too). Pretty much any inconvenient moment. It was terrifying, and for a while, it felt like my body was failing me without warning.

Over time, I’ve learned to recognize the patterns and triggers, usually sleep deprivation, caffeine, or overwhelming stress and I’ve found a few things that genuinely help. First, I don’t avoid driving, even though it used to terrify me; avoiding it just builds the fear up more, which only leads to more panic and its crazy symptoms. If things get bad on the road, I pull over, take out a book I keep in the car and read for a bit, or let myself have a frustration cry or nap if needed. I make sure never to drive tired or hungover, and I find drinking caffeine before or during a trip can trigger it too (caffeine is a stimulant and can trigger the stress response and the release of cortisol ((stress hormone)) in people with underlying anxiety). Basically, caffeine and alcohol make anxiety 5000x worse. Since the hand cramps are tied to calcium levels, I keep a Gatorade nearby to help with electrolytes while driving and I start every morning with a litre of filtered water with Celtic salt and lemon squeezed in it. Playing a movie on my dash (where I can glance at it periodically and safely) helps distract my brain from the panic spiral. Slow and deep breathing helps prevent hyperventilation and reduces the flight or fight system. And cleaning up my diet has helped BIG time - gut health is strongly linked to mental health. It’s taken time, but learning to face it, rather than fight it or flee from it, has made a huge difference. 

By doing the above, I’ve successfully driven from my home town to school in a different city (2.5 hrs away) almost weekly without any incidences and I’ve sat in a chair without feeling like the building is going to fall backwards. It comes and goes in waves, sometimes it won’t happen for months and then it’ll happen for 2 months straight. But the more successful days I have, the more confidence I build, and the less it happens. I realize it’s most likely a part of me now - so I embrace it when it does occur, rather than fear it, and do what I can to prevent and remedy it. 

These days, I like to look at my brain like it’s a puppy (lol). I love that puppy, but sometimes it does things that piss me off and really ruins my day. But of course I’m not going to abuse that puppy just because it misbehaved - it’ll just make things worse. I’m going to have patience and train that puppy. Yeah, sometimes the puppy will still be disobedient, but with love, a hell of a lot of patience, and proper training, it’ll get a whole lot better and eventually the mishaps will very seldom happen. 

It took me six whole years to figure this out and it was a scary ride (literally) until recently. I’m hoping this can help someone else going through this, because I wish I had this advice back then. 

Be kind to yourself while you figure out what works best for you. You’re not going crazy - your body just can’t tell the difference between stress/anxiety and the end of the world. It takes time, but with practice and introspection, you’ll be able to navigate it much better. It might even disappear altogether. ",1745286964.0,panicdisorder

1k4n83k,"Hi im new here, so tired","Have a wedding to attend in a few hours. Im male, 26 years old

Yesterday i had a panic attack. i met my cousins new gf of 10 months, my cousins like a brother to me, we grew up together and work together sometimes. (Its not their wedding today, its someone else)

I was so nervous to meet her, afraid she wouldnt like me or whatever. Its really important to me that my cousins gf likes my family. I was mostly just afraid in general. Anyway when they walked in i had a panic attack, maybe a few panic attacks, cant remember clearly. Im pretty good at keeping it internal (as long as its not bad enough). Dont think anyone noticed. I dissociate pretty easily.

Hate panic attacks so much. I just wanted to post here where maybe someone who understands might read it. Someone who has experienced what im talking about.

The worst thing for me is the effect it has on my life, my self esteem. Just a few years ago i was a grooms man in a wedding. Stood up there and everything. Couldnt do that now. I wouldnt want ""my disorder"" to ruin someones wedding. This time im just sitting in the pews but im still nervous.

Its exhausting. Im tired all the time, so i drink coffee to get energy up and get work done, and that makes my anxiety worse. I take hydroxyzine hcl to go to sleep every night. Its lighter than benzos but brain fog is a common side effect. Gas, break, gas, break, gas...

I feel like im going through life with both feet flooring the gas and the breaks.

I honestly just wanted to complain.

Im afraid ill never be able to have a romantic relationship. Im a man, and i think generally women arent attracted to men who are seemingly afraid of their own shadow.

I live my whole life in pure spite of my anxiety. Everything i do is like a battle in a long drawn out war. I put myself in situations where i know ill have a terrible time or a panic attack because god damnit its the only thing i can do. I have to live life. I have to go do things. Locking myself in the house is not an acceptable solution.

Im just grateful the panic attacks i have arent so bad, compared to ones ive had in the past. Its crazy, the spectrum of panic. Even a small one is severely uncomfortable, but the really big ones are beyond what you can imagine until you have one. Thank god i dont have those so often. Just once every few years on a really bad day. So far never happened in public with anyone around, thank god.

I hope one day i could meet someone who understands what im going through, what ive been going through my whole life. Someone who is proud of me. Its a lot harder to fight when no one sees youre fighting. Im so tired today.

Ill go to this wedding today. If i panic ill hold my breath and look at my feet. I wont drink. I wont eat. I wont dance. Ill hold my breath and look at my feet. And when i get home, and my legs buckle and i fall into bed, ill say to myself, im proud of you and i see what youre going through. Good job

Edit: wedding done, back home. Had a few panic attacks sitting in the chair during ceremony. Dont think anyone noticed. Held my breath and tried to relax. Then more later during speeches and dancing, super super loud music. Glad i went. It was very nice, very happy for the newlyweds. Soooooo happy its over. Such a relief. I think i need to force myself to go out more. One day at a time i guess.

1k4ckn0,Fear of losing control,"Hello everyone, will try to keep it short and to the point. 

I had my first pretty terrible panic attack about 4 months ago and since then I never felt the same - aside from already existing depression and little underneath anxiety it now turned into a bigger 24/7 anxiety, brain fog, memory and concentration problems, I space out often. I also started getting occasional suicidal ideations which I never had in my life, but the weirdest of all was the feeling that someone flicked the switch in my head, and since that indicdent i became more foggy and dissociated. And it's not a depersonalization or derealisation. I experience it throughout the day often. it's like i feel confused, dissociated (spaced out basically) and i feel like I'm going to behave inadequately and not normal in the near future. I also quite frequently seek reassurance to see if things are truly there or not.

1k4bkwq,1 year later,"today marks 1 year since the worst panic attack of my life. it sent me spiraling into a mental breakdown filled with constant DPDR, depression which I never dealt with before, anxiety and SI. I remember telling my therapist that I felt like I died and this was hell.

after 4 months of that I got on Lexapro. I started feeling better a few months later and I haven’t had a panic attack as severe since. I’ve had a few moments for sure, but I’m able to stay rational and use my coping skills to calm myself down. I seem to have most of my setbacks right before my menstrual cycle. 

I won’t say I’m 100% recovered, I still deal with anxiety sometimes, basically everything I worry about stems from never wanting to be in that place again. I think “what if I have DPDR that lasts weeks again”, “what if I don’t ever recover”, etc. Does anyone else feel this way? It’s like PTSD.

1k2i7cp,Taking Ativan every day,"Hi all,

Quick background: I had my first panic attack in 2013 and after a lot of therapy and the right medication (Effexor), I stopped having them completely in 2018. (From 2013-2018 I was regularly having them, and also had GAD and agoraphobia.)

Unfortunately they started again in mid-2023. It sounds so insane when I say or write it, but the way my panic disorder/anxiety has manifested in the last two years is fear of being away from my car. It's like my brain has latched onto the idea that if I have this fast moving thing near me, I can escape quickly and drive home or to the nearest hospital. It feels like a weird and extreme form of flight, from the fight-flight response.

So for the last two years, in order for me to be away from my car--like to comfortably go on a walk or take the metro, for instance--I take Ativan. I've been taking 0.25-0.75mg almost every day for two years as I keep trying different medications (under the guidance of my doctor) to no long-term success so far. (The current one I'm on is Anafranil 150mg.)

Does anyone else take Ativan every day? Do you feel like a failure if so? I've tried to live a normal life without it, but if I ever try and do anything that may trigger my panic disorder, the fear becomes all-encompassing and it's all I can focus on. But now, every time I take Ativan, I feel like I'm choosing the easy route. Like I know you're not supposed to take these everyday. But I don't know what else to do.

If anyone can relate, or has some kind words, I would really appreciate.

I think it’s important to acknowledge 5 as an accomplishment because this disorder is something we have to live with, it’s unrealistic to assume one day we’ll wake up and never have anxiety again. So a 5 is a victory for most of us.

During the game I kept taking a break between quarters in the bathroom and just deep breathing because it felt SO uncomfortable being in the seat and I could not stop body scanning and ruminating and pay attention to the game. Kevin Durant had 49 points and they showed Travis Scott and Jason Bateman on the screen and I just kept thinking “I’m going to pass out and/or die in front of these celebrities”.

That entire trip we walked SO much because I felt like I couldn’t sit still and I could barely sit in a restaurant and it was just a generally sucky time and I didn’t enjoy the trip. Again, it was so early in my panic disorder and didn’t have an official diagnosis yet so I had no idea what to do to recover.

1jxpx2b,I need to know.,"TL;DR - I've been diagnosed with panic disorder; is my strange, irregular heartbeat a symptom of that?

About one month ago today, I started having irregular heartbeats. It was the kind of heartbeat that stops for a moment, then returns back to normal with a hard pulse. Feeling this gave me a bit of anxiety and dread. The next day, I'm at work, being checked by paramedics because these heartbeats weren't going away and were only increasing in frequency. I was told that everything was fine, that my vitals were good, and that my heart rate was normal.

A week or so later, I call the paramedics to my house after nearly fainting from one of these heartbeats. The anxiety was there, my body was shaking, that sense of impending doom was present. I get my vitals checked again, and everything - according to them - was ""textbook"".

Four hours later, I was in the emergency room. I felt like I couldn't breathe, the strange irregular heartbeats were occurring, I was having tingling in both my lower arms and hands, sweating - I felt like I was going to die. I stood in the emergency room for 2 hours, then laid in a patient room for an additional four. I got an x-ray, an EKG, a blood test, was hooked up to a monitor and waiting for a doctor to tell me the bad news - only to be told that everything was fine. Despite being hooked up to a heart monitor and feeling these irregular heartbeats even **during** the diagnosis, I was told that everything looked normal.

Some time before the emergency room visit, I visited a cardiologist. I got an echocardiogram, was told to walk on a treadmill. The cardiologist looked at my echocardiogram and said ""your heart is good and strong.""

In the emergency room, I got told I have ""episodic paroxysmal anxiety"", which was parentheticized as ""panic disorder"". I was prescribed hydroxyzine hydrochloride, 25mg, to take four times a day 'as needed' for anxiety. Even when taking this medication, something I'm being incredibly cautious with, the heartbeat - of all symptoms - was still occurring.

At a doctor's appointment some time after, the doctor who checked my heartbeat also said it was ""strong."" I was almost immediately recommended to a psychiatrist and a counselor when I started initially describing my problems. I was then prescribed buspirone, which I haven't been able to get to picking up yet, but will do so tomorrow. I was also given a comprehensive blood panel and urinalysis, both of which I'll know the results of when I follow up this Tuesday.

A third visit from the paramedics after a potential scare, and I was told, yet again, that I was ""textbook"" (""your vitals are so normal that they look like they're coming out of a textbook"").

I'm no stranger to anxiety or stress. I do feel it sometimes, but I have never felt anything like this before, and it just keeps happening. It's like it's never ending and there is a constant thought that, any moment, this could be it. These symptoms were even occurring to me in my sleep - one time I felt like I woke up in death-panic mode. I've been told that the irregular heartbeat might be psychosomatic, but I've been skeptical, because if I'm asleep, wouldn't it be less prevalent?

I need to know if what I'm feeling lines up with symptoms that you all have been feeling, because I feel lost.",1744487820.0,panicdisorder

1jxikyw,Am I Too Much to Handle?,"I was clinically diagnosed with panic disorder in 2015. A few years later, in 2018, I was also diagnosed with hypochondriasis and depression. Fortunately, I’ve managed to control my panic attacks without taking medication.

When I met my girlfriend (who is now my wife), I was open with her from the beginning about my mental health. She listened, and I took that as a good sign—a sign that she accepted me fully, even with my struggles.

We’re now in our second year of marriage. There have been a few times when I’ve had to be rushed to the hospital because of panic attacks, and she has always gone with me. I’ve appreciated that. But there are also times I’ve had to skip certain events or activities because of physical symptoms or anxiety triggers. Instead of understanding, she often assumes I’m just making excuses.

One example: I once tried taking public transportation—one of my major panic triggers. I had a really bad panic attack and had to use my inhaler to calm down. But she didn’t like the smell of it and got mad at me instead of comforting me.

Recently, after grocery shopping at the mall with our baby and carrying several bags, we decided to stop for dinner. The place was crowded and hot. I could feel a panic attack coming on fast. I told her I needed to step away and find a cooler, less crowded spot to calm myself. I texted her to explain and reassured her I’d be back soon. Even though I still didn’t feel okay, I returned to our table because I didn’t want to leave her and our baby alone for too long.

But as soon as I sat down, I felt another wave—stronger this time. I had to leave again. We ended up arguing over text while I tried to manage the attack.

After about 15 minutes, I felt better and went back. She was finishing her meal, crying. Two hours passed, and she still didn’t speak to me.

I really thought she accepted me—not just the good parts, but even the parts I struggle with, like my mental health. Right now, it hurts deeply to feel misunderstood and unsupported by the person I love the most.",1744468212.0,panicdisorder

1jwr24f,"I did it, you can too!","Okay people, here is my list of how I stopped letting panic disorder rule my life. All of the things in here will be things I have tried and succeeded with. 

First, my story- About 6 months ago something traumatic happened to me, I was assaulted by a man. It triggered my Panic Disorder so bad that I couldn’t eat and lost over 20lbs/9kgs in two weeks. I was non stop panicking begging my husband to make it stop. I eventually had to go to the ER I was starving to death. They had to give me IV’s and things. When I left the hospital I felt some better, but still controlled by my panic disorder. After a few more days, my panic attacks went away and I thought I was free, but a couple months later, they came back. But I was prepared this time. I let them have less of a hold on me. And now today, they barely have a hold on me and I’m so grateful. 

Here’s what I do to stop a panic attack
I gave my panic a name to separate it from myself. His name is Reginald. Human emotions only last about 90 seconds. The reason you feel them longer than that is because you remind your brain about whatever is making you feel that way. So when Reginald comes, I say “Okay Reggie, we’re going to sit here together for 90 seconds, but then you have to go” and once the 90 seconds is done I imagine him walking out of a door in my head. 
Next, the physical symptoms of panic attacks is the worst for me, so I try keep them from happening or work with them. For example, nausea, I have been more mindful about what I eat and drink so I know that there’s no reason for me to be nauseous. For heart racing, I get up and dance to give my heart a physical reason to be racing. It’s very helpful. 
Lastly, I’m a Christian, praying really helps me, and listening to Christian music, if you’re not religious, you could try meditations. They ALWAYS help me. 

I hope this can help at least one person. ",1744381269.0,panicdisorder

I'm 21 years old and have been dealing with panic disorder for the past 6 years. Over time, I've made significant progress in managing it and accepting it as part of my life. However, today was a tough day.

I had to undergo a physical exam at school to get cleared for my internship. My blood pressure was high, which caught the attention of the male head nurse. He reacted quite negatively and loudly asked me about my medications, making sure everyone around could hear. My classmates also laughed. It was incredibly embarrassing.

I asked an intern to tell him to lower his voice, but she just told me to ""just tell sir."" So, I explained that I have panic disorder and have been taking propranolol for a month to see if it helps. His response? ""Why would you panic, it's just BP."" I felt so frustrated and wanted to leave immediately. I told him, ""If I knew, I wouldn't need the medication.""

It's been two hours since this happened, but it still hurts and feels so embarrassing. I feel like no one understands what I'm going through, and it makes me feel so alone. This experience has triggered a relapse and brought back some dark thoughts.

I know traveling is stressful for some and it brings a lot of anxiety but i promise you, you will learn so much about how strong and capable you are when you just let yourself feel the anxiousness and panic. I felt great going out and having something to do rather than stay at home and dwell in how horrible i felt. Yes i did have a couple panic attacks and was anxious often but then i faced it head on even if it was hard and uncomfortable and turned out always being okay and good at the end of the day and i was still
having fun despite what i was feeling. I felt like i had a breakthrough this trip because i always had this thought in my head like “i can’t do it i can’t do it” because of how awful i felt everywhere but i had no choice but to face it and go through it and 100% of the time I got through the things i never thought i could. That goes to show that you are capable of doing anything you set your mind to and that your brain is lying to you most of the time. trust in yourself and you’ll always win in the end.

1jwah84,What was I having? Help,"


Hello! 29M here with a lot on my mind! All mye life since 12 years old when I was attacked by an another student. After that episode I started to get OCD, health anxiety and a lot more. I controlled it for many years and was doing fine. When I was 23 I was in a bad relationship for 3 years, no income, a lot of unpaid bills, moved further away from my family and were not in a good place. 
So, the one episode that completely changed my life… One winter day, we went downhill skiing. We were arguing and the trip was not nice at all. I hadn’t been drinking and eating good that day and on the final trip down I went fast and was like really working out on the way down. When I was standing at the bottom waiting for my girlfriend, I was hanging over my poles. When she came I quickly rised up and starting to walk towards the car parking. 2 minutes walking I felt really weak in my legs… I was feeling tired and said that I need to lay down soon.. then I needed to slump my self slowly to the ground and at that time I was feeling I was going to die… I was completely sure… then, after I lied on my back for 3 seconds I was thinking that this couldn’t be the end so I quickly raised my self up in a sitting position and the suddenly I got a hot flush, started sweating and I checked my pulse on my arm and couldn’t find it.. so I was thinking that my heart had stopped… punched my self in the chest and was starting to freak out… hands where ice cold, shaking, white hands and nails…. I gathered my self up and walked towards the car and packed it before driving ( I was driving) home. I was still feeling weak in my legs and I was really cold on my hands. Feet where cold but they where  cold sweaty also.. when I got in home I was shaking and not feeling good! But I could walk and i got my self in the shower. At the bathroom I saw that I was white in my face like pale and I was still shaking, sometimes my hole body… like cold feeling… after the shower I quickly lied down on the sofa and I was feeling better after some minutes of relaxing. But then suddenly I felt my heart was not in a normal rythm… I felt my pulse and it was all over the place…. Called the ER and told them everything… told them my heartbeat live via call and it was like 90 bpm but a lot of skipped beats every two beats… they told me it was okey and I should just relax…. The after 1 hour I went to bed and fell asleeep and the next day my heartbeat was normal again…
One month after this episode my anxiety started to grow. I was completely sure that I had a sick heart… I got several EKG’s , one right ekgs , ultrasound, bloodwork and even an MRI scan of my heart. Everything was fine and perfect they told me… Hard to believe but u did. Was fine for 6 years and not one more episode, but now my thoughts is coming again… what was that episode that happened 6 years ago? Was it only a massive panic attack? I’ve recently taken ultrasound and ekg and holter and everything was still fine… 
Can someone please tell me something about my experience? What do you think? Can it happen only one time? Was it dangerous? Anyone else experienced this? Pleas give me some answers so I can calm down…

1jvorma,Medication success?,I was on lexapro for 3 years and decided to get off of it September of last year because I was a numb zombie. I couldn’t be stripped of my bed and I slept all day long. I couldn’t go a day without taking a nap. I felt like my feet were incased in concrete. It was really good for the first few months off my medication. I actually had a little energy again and I wasn’t numb anymore. But the past couple of months have been hell. I tried suppressing it the best I could but ended up having a full blown panic attack the other day during a meltdown. I was in a hyperventilation fit and my arms and hands started buzzing like crazy. My hands locked up on me and I couldn’t move them. Luckily my sister talked me down and it only lasted a couple of minutes. But it left me feeling ashamed and embarrassed. Now my anxiety is at an all time high. I got a prescription for hydroxyzine and I’m honestly too scared to take it. I’ve taken it before and it just made me sleepy. It’s a lot like Benadryl and I worry because I’ve had a panic attack on Benadryl and it was super scary. I felt drugged whilst panicking and couldn’t snap out of it. So now I feel like I have to get back on medication but I don’t want to go back to sleeping all day. Can anyone tell me their medication success stories or recommend a medication that works best for panic disorder? ,1744256590.0,panicdisorder

I went YEARS without medication and living a fairly normal life to waking up one day thinking I was dying and my life being flipped upside down ever since. 

I think the hardest part for me is my symptoms are always so different, it’s difficult for me to ever tell what’s real and what isn’t. 
Some days I have the typical panic attack symptoms (fast heart rate, chest tightness, sweats, dizziness) but then other days I have other symptoms that can sometimes really really freak me out (extreme nausea, headaches, shivering, clammy skin, numbness in my left arm/chest area)- like right now for instance, idk if it’s bc it’s day 2 of my time of the month but I just overall do not feel good. I woke up from only being asleep for like 45 minutes and my heart was racing and I’m shaking really bad and I feel like I need to throw up and my face is super flushed feeling. 

I’ve been to the ER more times than I can count this past year, to the point where every nurse and doctor know me by name before I even check myself in. Everytime I’ve been, everything comes back clear. I’ve had X-rays, ct scans, EKGs, endoscopy and even an echocardiogram done in the past year and all of that always comes back fine too. I recently had a heart monitor on for the third time for 14 days and all it shows is sinus tachycardia but no one seems concerned bc they think it’s just all anxiety/panic related. At what point do I throw in the towel and accept it’s just panic disorder and nothing is seriously wrong with me? I mean truly.. I’ve had test after test after test done and everything always comes back okay. I’m so tired of always being on edge and constantly getting tests done when nothing ever seems to be wrong. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’m glad that something doesn’t appear to be seriously wrong with me but also at the same time, I wish there was a cure for feeling like this almost every single day.

1jsh79b,I did it! Kinda,"For a little bit of context my panic disorder is rooted in my extreme emetophobia (fear of throwing up) which means whenever I get stressed and feel the slightest twinge of nausea I have a panic attack. For the past 11 years I have been dreading the day I get the stomach flu, as a teenager I restricted my diet and obsessively washed my hands, avoided going out in public, anything and everything to avoid getting sick. Now I’m 24 and I’ve gotten better slowly, I no longer restrict my diet so much, I like going out and doing things, and even trying new foods. 
Well Tuesday when I was at work (closing shift as a waitress)  the worst possible thing that could ever happen to me (worse than death in my mind) happened. I started to feel nauseous and started to gag and get sick. I hid in the bathroom panicking, crying, calling, texting and begging my mom, texting my stepdad, texting and begging my boyfriend (m37) for help cause that’s what I do when I’m panicking by myself I reach out to anybody for comfort even though in my mind I know they can’t help stop the fear. My boyfriend seemed annoyed but was about to come help me, when my boss called and said I could go home if I was that sick. I texted my boyfriend that he didn’t need to come after all cause I was given the clear to go home. I raced home and spent the whole night using every single coping and calming mechanism I had to get myself through the whole ordeal. I occasionally texted my boyfriend about the shitty situation but, all in all I managed to survive getting sick a total of 5 times all by myself.
The next day I felt like I got hit by a train and I was trying to text my boyfriend but he just ghosted me throughout the whole day and until the next day. When I was panicking he made me promise him that I would find some help for anxiety if he came to comfort me. I said yes cause of course who wouldn’t and I do know that I need to be working on it a bit more. Well I tried booking a therapy session with the only therapist in my area that’s covered by my insurance but her schedule doesn’t line up with mine, I told him I’d tried some new self-help books, look into support groups (there are none in my small ass city), and in general just look into anxiety support. That’s apparently not enough, or there’s apparently more I haven’t liked into. 
I thought I did really good, I’m proud of myself for managing it on my own. The beginning I admit was very rocky. But the rest of the night even the next day when I was sore from head to toe I was doing everything by myself and remaining relatively calm and I think I killed it. It wasn’t as bad as I remember it being when I was little and I feel like I won. 🙌🏻

1jr1vx6,Constant Panic attacks.,"Are there any passive side effects you can have even when you’re not panicking from having this disorder when it gets really bad? All of last month I began experiencing horrible debilitating panic attacks nearly everyday, and now I am experiencing effects i believe might be from it. Such as constant tension headaches/pressure and tension in the back of my neck and head and also tingling and weakness down to the right side of my body accompanied by light tremors in my neck, head and hands. 

I just constantly feel dizzy and on the edge of panic and anxiety. I feel stressed and sick almost everyday, it’s beginning to affect my daily life. I can’t do anything I used to love doing because I don’t feel normal or feel good anymore, sitting up or being in public makes me feel worse and when i feel my symptoms i just constantly think about them making it worse, i feel so depersonalized from everything and trapped in my own body. Are these side effects from constant panic attacks, stress and anxiety or something more? 

Edit: I got my cbc blood tests back and it said it was abnormal. Mostly my Monocytes being really high, high Absolute Eosinophils levels, and high Absolute Basophils levels.

Late january I got the notice that about 20% of my company workforce would get laid off, and more information would be announced as the process developed. This was about a two month ordeal, waking up every day wondering. So I really stepped into gear, worked my ass off and showed up. I really love my job, too.

About a month into this my partner lost their job, so the situation developed into one where we both might be unemployed come spring. Worrying to say the least but I kept my nose to the grindstone.

News came a few weeks ago, and ive still got a job. I was very relieved. And at this point maybe some of you reading this might know where this is headed.

Its not until now, after the fact, that I crashed. I spent one weekend really tired and sad, and ever since then I have a daily physical sense of dread, fear or panic in my chest. Im still myself, im not really afraid or sad in my mind, but my body feels like im being chased or im about to be attacked at times.

The feeling comes and goes, usually when my day starts and then varies in intensity during the day and usually is better in the evening. Im sleeping well, eating well, nothing else really bothers me, except my nerves sometimes feel like there is an imminent threat to my safety.

Has anyone ever isolated for a length period and reintegrated into doing the things you want and need to do? I know there's not a overnight one size fits all, rome was built in a day kind of answer. I'm just looking for any suggestions or anyone who can even relate to this, even if still going through it.

1jp61yx,This is a brutal disorder,"I was first diagnosed with PD at 13 (10 years ago), and have had ups and downs since. Some years I won’t have a single panic attack, but when I do, it’s non-stop and debilitating. It just feels so cruel. And comical. And infuriating. Things will be fine and within a day they’re not, and I can’t eat or sleep, it disrupts my entire life and I’m effectively immobilized. I wish I was physically sick instead, or that I could buy the mental stability for a specific price. I’d pay it even if it cost me everything. I wish it was a broken arm, or leg. I’d break it myself, if I could trade this discomfort for another.

I feel so empathetic reading other posts on here. It’s crazy to think that others (the majority of the population) live full lives without ever going through this. I know it’ll pass, but I dread that it’ll probably happen again, and again, and again. Just sort of creeping up every few years to roundhouse kick my life inside out for a few days, sometimes weeks, or months. 

For anyone going through this right now as well, I am WITH YOU. And we got this. This shit is so ass but we got this and it’ll be alright. Honestly I’ve never met another person with this disorder irl so it feels really isolating but it’s comforting to know there’s others with similar experiences and struggles out there.

Life can be tough. Sometimes it feels like the pain never stops. But here’s the thing: even when life hits hard, we can still find reasons to smile. 🌟

It doesn’t have to be a big moment—sometimes a small win, a kind word, or just a quiet moment for yourself can make a difference.

The more we practice noticing these little reasons to be happy, the stronger we become at handling life’s challenges.

Remember: you’re not alone, and even in tough times, there’s always something worth smiling for.

1powdjs,Social brain fog and depression,"I'm 17 male and im depressed and i have no friends. I like talking with people and socialising and don't fear social interactions. I was really self concious in the past and was weird socially but it seemed to fade away. Now i've been hitting the gym for some time, trying to eat good foods etc. im trying to realize what the reason for my fog is. I have bad long term memory but i know i had this fog for years now.

It basically goes like this: I go to school, meet with my classmates and talk with them. They're not my close friends but they hang out with me. They're the athletic type dudes, we banter a lot. We can sometimes strike a good convo or have some fun and during that i feel present and capable. However having to socialise with them for hours daily at school is always really hard and fatiguing due to the fog that comes. I easily lose attention, find it hard to formulate clear thoughts, lose my awareness and when not in the center of attention i zone off and completely turn myself off. Thing is im really aware of the fog presence and try to battle it by forcing myself to pay attention, relaxing my eyes and trying to like half metaphorically narrow my eyes to be less in my head. Despite me trying hard the fog and that feeling of being in my head remains.

A very similar fog but from a different source appears when im focusing on reading something, writing something or doing a strenuous mental task. It once again blocks my clear thinking and seriously impairs my presense and social skills, when i finish such task or try to shift attention. My mind kind of remains on that activity that i finished and wont allow me to move onto another.

When the fog hits i usually end my school day in a bad mood and dont want to socialise outside school after that. Its not like people around me dont try to invite me onto things its just that i always decline them due to that fog which i know will make my shared time with people painful strange and tiring. The fog usually lifts after like an hour or a few hours of not having to socialise, but the bad mood remains, making my days boring sad and repetitive.

When i was a kid, i think i did struggle with some sort of social anxiety. Nowadays i dont feel any fear however. I can often do or say weird things due to being socially stupid from not having friends for years, but they dont affect me as badly as they used to. Cringe things i did would significantly destroy my mood for days and keep me up at night in the past but now i dont think about them at all. Its stupid and contradicting that i like socialising, would want to have many friends but im unable to.

**Its a fucking loop. I dont have friends and im depressed>I try to socialise and make friends>I get extremely tired and foggy from socialising>I try to escape from socialising and wont socialise past school which makes me unable to connect with people>I dont have anyone to talk to in free time and have no hobbies or a desire to have one>repeat**

So for the past week ive been trying more intensely than ever to solve this and find the reason for my fog. I have bad health, so i decided upon eating lots of probiotic foods and cutting down on processed ones. I'll try to have a better sleep schedule and take supplements (right now 4000u vitamin D and Magnesium). And i'll make sure to be hydrated. I might try meditating. Im getting desperate and ill try fixing all the possible physical health reasons for my fog and cognitive decline. It will be hard to push through due to my chronically low motivation. But comparing what i have now and what i feel deep inside to what was a while ago i know i can do it.

I will probably visit a psychiatrist soon and im wondering if i should do a blood test.

If you can share something about it or know something that i dont please do. I appreciate all help. I want to get out of this shit.

1pouu7f,23F – Social anxiety ruined my life and now marriage is next. What am I supposed to do?,"I’m 23F and I honestly don’t know how to function like a normal human being.

I have severe social anxiety and zero confidence. I can’t do basic things that people my age find normal. Talking to strangers, asking for help, presentations, family gatherings — all of it makes my heart race, hands shake, mind go blank. Interacting with the opposite gender feels impossible.

My childhood was a mess. I was bullied a lot, and on top of that my parents were extremely overprotective. They never let me go out, never let me make my own decisions, never let me fail or learn. I grew up stuck inside my shell.  
Now suddenly I’m an adult and they expect me to “handle everything on my own” — but I was never taught *how*.

University was pure hell. I got humiliated so many times. I had no friends. No one included me in their groups. I always felt invisible or unwanted. Watching everyone else socialize effortlessly while I struggled just to speak destroyed whatever confidence I had left.

Now there’s another marriage fear too. I’m at the age where it’s expected soon, and the thought of living in a house full of strangers for the rest of my life terrifies me. I barely survived university — how am I supposed to handle an entire new family, expectations, interactions, and no escape?

People say, *“Nobody cares, just do it.”* Saying it is easy. Doing it feels impossible for me. My body reacts like I’m in danger even when I know logically that I’m not.

I’ve tried everything I could think of. Self-help videos, forcing myself into situations, motivation talks, positive thinking. Everything works temporarily, then I crash back to zero. It feels like my personality is fundamentally broken.

I’m at a point where I **need to change**, because I genuinely don’t think I can take any more humiliation. I don’t want to live like this forever. I don’t want to be scared of people. I don’t want my entire life defined by fear.

Please tell me — **how do you actually fix this?**

1poujkb,Followup: Propranolol for presentation,"Two days ago i posted this thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1pnjnt6/propranolol\_for\_presentation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1pnjnt6/propranolol_for_presentation/)

  
Today was the big day, and i took 20mg propranolol 2 hours before the presentation. Then another 10mg 45 min before,

When it was 15 minutes until i was going to deliver my presentation, i started to get really nervous, and i didn't even know if the pills were going to work. It felt exactly like earlier presentations where i enter fight or flight mode, and my body goes  into complete panick mode.

And it really did feel like that, but the physical reactions just wasn't there anymore. It felt like my heart should be racing at 180bpm, but looking at my watch it was staying put at 65-75. It was such an absurd situation where i could almost feel the adrenalin releasing, and my head was preparing me and even tricking me into believing my heart was racing, my body was shaking etc, but i had complete control over my body. No shaking, no dry mouth. Just nothing. Had to pee a bit, but that was probably because i still was nervous.

  
So my turn finally came up. I went up on stage infront of 40 people. Nervous, anxious and all that, but i could feel having control over my body. Opened my mouth, and my god that is probably the best 10 minutes i have had in years. I didn't suddenly become a good public speaker, but that wasn't expected either since i have been avoiding these situations for the last couple of years, but i really enjoyed my time up there. I spoke with a clear voice, i even went away from the computer to stand on the ""open floor"" instead of hiding behind the computer, and it looked like people had a good time.

1por02j,I am not sure what I feel,"Hi, I am a 31F, and I started feeling extremely anxious when I took up a sales job at 26 (I have had social anxiety before too, in school, thanks to bullying, but I was doing better until this job). I had to make cold calls, conduct meetings, get clients, give presentations, etc. The worst part was when we had training sessions or mock cold calling; monitoring my every tone and each word became too hectic. I started to completely lose confidence.

There were times when I performed really well, but I would replay it later in my head and condemn myself.

Soon, I was unable to talk to clients or make phone calls. I could not say a single word in meetings, afraid that I would be wrong or sound stupid. My performance tanked. I hid in the bathroom to breathe. I eventually managed to leave my job. I became a recluse. Life happened.

Later, I was asked by a friend to co-found a company, and the same thing happened. I was amazing at first, but gradually failed to contribute anything.

But here’s the thing, people in my circle do not believe I have severe social anxiety because I am energetic and can gel well to an extent. But the before and after a social event are exhausting. I practice lines, try to avoid going, get high before meetings. I relive moments, scan and nitpick each word I said, think about how I sat, whether I sat right or not, and so on afterward.

Adding to all this is my severe body dysmorphia.

I absolutely hate meeting people, but once they are in front of me, I am really good. In my head, I feel like I am performing. It is hard to make friends, or even keep any at this point.

1poqhm6,Is it normal to feel Jealous?,"Hello, I am not familiar with how to USE Reddit. I mostly go here to get some SIMS 4 cheats or manga updates.

I picked this specific thread because I think my jealousy stems from my social anxiety + attachment issues.

But I feel like there’s not much people I can talk to about this , so I figure why let out some steam on Reddit. Probably the most stupid decision out of all any other possible options. But I wanna hear some thoughts from outsiders.

  
Quick Background about me: I am 17 years old and I am not really good at talking to others. I can talk well if I become really close with someone, but people who I’m not familiar with or I’m just not close to I just tend to keep my mouth shut.

Meeting new people is scary for me and Talking can be very difficult especially when I can’t be my authentic self. 

Especially when I know I can’t be friends with people who don’t have the same morals and values as me. But I’m enrolled in a Christian school, and these type of schools here in my country don’t have a really good reputation when handling their students. Ps. Also because my interest are very Niche and they probably won’t be interested.

Because of this, I barely have any close friends in my new school. Sure I can talk to them, but I usually have to comfort myself in the back of my mind. Fearing that they are thinking the worst things about me. As this goes by, I became anti-social. But I’m fine with that, because I have my family to keep me company. Even tho they can be crazy sone times.

So with all those information in mind. I don’t think it’s not that much of a surprise to most of you that I get easily attached if i do make a close friend. or any sort of connection.

This friend “M” in particular is really really cool. They can speak many languages and is a very amazing artist. And I have a lover ”L” who’s also an artist! 

These two people are one of the most important in my life rn. But recently I discovered something about myself that I am not really fond of.

Whenever M or L are hanging out with their other friend/s, I tend to usually get very sad or upset. I didn’t know why I just feel so down whenever they hang out with someone else. 

(Another PS. It’s also not only them I get jealous of. Some other friends as well, just using them as prime examples because I talk to them the most).

I am very self aware that they can be friends and hang out with other people. I don’t stop them. I don’t lash out. and I definitely don’t get angry at them for it. I just tend to bury it deep inside me.

Because it’s a childish thing to be like “I feel jealous that you have other friends“ and that just sounds so stupid to me. Because they are allowed to be have other people in their life and I am not entitled to be possessive over them.

But it just really hurts. I don’t know why.

My conclusion to this, is Probably because ever since moving to a new town, with a new community, and a new school. I have been alone.

While my previous IRL friends have now turned into online friends. All of them are close together while I’m here struggling to even form new relationships because I’m scared of new people. And it sucks.

I do wanna be able to have new friends and create new connections. But like I said it hard.

My Social Anxiety was bearable when I had my friends by my side, but now that I’m alone again I feel like I’m hopeless.

Ever since I found out about this thing called jealousy , I am beginning to overthink more and more.   


Because it’s not right for me to feel jealous over my friends having other friends. Especially when I know those people are also very cool and creative.

I barely remember any interactions with anyone. I remember being polite and try to make small talk ( mostly just wait until they talk first lol ) 

Then I got moved to nightshift. After a week everything was okay I was doing little ""assistant"" sort of tasks until one morning somebody asked me to ""see to a resident"" 

I sort of blue screened until I eventually said okay and went to the resident. She was very sleepy and floppy to sit up onto the bed. I started changing her until my back hurt so much from holding her up comfortably so I placed her down and asked for help. It's already like 6 minutes past shift change so dayshift is there.

3 people rushed into her room and looked shocked. I saw their faces and i instantly started crying and panicking, having sort of skipped breathing hicks. I got reassured everything is okay and that they phrased it wrong saying to just scan her qr code on her door as a check (like other residents, I must have forgot to check her earlier) 
The problem was she's a double and it was a risk for me and the resident to get ready and was almost impossible to change in the morning. They said they were impressed that I actually got her almost ready in bed but I didn't care. I only cared about the resident and I was never told she was a double. 

Many people are singles on that floor so being me I did whatever they asked me to without question as I worry I'll sound stupid if I ask them. Which is silly but it's better to be prepared for high risk patient care knowledge then myself looking stupid. 

All of the day shift saw me crying and hyperventilating and panicking as I was worried I hurt her. I didn't, but they were saying everything okay and to go home and rubbing my back and holding my hand. I felt like a child. I felt stupid. I felt insecure and useless. 

This is why I think dayshift laugh at me when they see me. 

Now it's been 3 months and I know better. One morning last week I was signing a paper and 2  dayshift girls behind me said "" cmon wait for Jess to sign it"" and laughed. At the time I didn't think much until I got home...why did they say that? I was only 5 seconds?...weird.

And yesterday, (don't know if it was the same girls) but I squeezed past them to empty a cup into the sink before I left, she didn't notice me and stepped backwards and bumped into my arm, I was the one to say sorry...I don't know why...but she turned to her friend and started laughing...why? 
I just don't get it? 
I gave them a questioning look as they turned their backs to me.

I struggle alot with crying...I cry very easily, I use to be a very angry kid until the anger switched to crying instead as I grew up. 

I just want to know why people act like this. I was going through alot during my first shifts and I feel like an idiot and treated like a child by the seniors because I can easily cry. They've only seen me cry that one time and nightshift one time when a resident was physically abusing me which was an understandable reason lol

But when I cry it's not from sadness, it's from frustration, confusion, guilt and anger. But I think they think I'm unstable and need babying...

I'm tired of the ""just ignore them when they laugh at you"" ""don't waste time thinking about it"" 
I need answers !!!! ",1765937306.0,socialanxiety
1poj43e,Anyone else great socially but an anxious mess when they're alone?,"I wanted to see if anyone here experiences something similar to me. I haven't used this sub reddit before so I'm not sure how common this is.

I can socialize just fine — I hold conversations, mess around, even act like the “joker” in my friend group. Most people wouldn’t guess I struggle at all. But the moment I’m alone, my anxiety hits hard and I ruminate. My brain flashes intrusive thoughts, overthinking events or interactions for years afterward, and I get physical tension like a tight chest, sweating, or even small tics like blinking hard or pinching myself. I feel like I always have to scroll on my phone before going to bed to keep distracted or negative thoughts will keep playing in my mind.

Small things can trigger it. I get the usual ""why did I say that?"" or ""why would i wear that outfit?"" But I feel it's particularly strong when it comes to not being able to control how im perceived. For e.g I started a secret TikTok to finally express myself without feeling overwhelming shame. One friend found it and mentioned it during a call and even thought I know its not that serious, I immediately started sweating, chest tight, almost in tears, and had to act like it didn’t bother me. After the call, I started deleting videos because I didnt want my friends to see that side of me, despite having other followers on that account. Even after calming myself down, I couldnt relax knowing that side of me has been seen. Since then, every time I’m alone I replay that idea the I've been ""exposed"" endlessly. I've been told in the past by people around me that It's okay to open up and I know logically the people around me would be supportive, but I still feel extreme discomfort.

I’ve always struggled to open up, and even when I share something small, like a hobby or plan, I regret it afterward once I'm home. But what has me confused is that the next day I’m fine socially again, joking, chatting and making a fool of myself, yet it starts over again as soon as I’m alone. For other reasons I am quite sure I have ADHD, which I think has helped me at getting distracted but desperate to open up, but my anxiety makes me overthink the interaction once I'm not distracted anymore.

I'm used to seeing the version where people get anxious building up courage to or just being around others. I used to have this version. Only experiencing it delayed, once I get home is what I find strange.

Does anyone else experience this type of anxiety where you function great socially but struggle internally, especially when alone or thinking about how you're perceived? How do you cope?

**TL;DR:** I act great socially but overthink and get anxious when alone, replaying interactions, feeling physical tension, and obsessing over how I’m perceived. Only to repeat again the next day. Anyone else relate?",1765933197.0,socialanxiety

1pogkkm,I think I might just stay single the rest of my life,"36F here. I’m sure stories like this are all over this place, but here’s yet another.

Had one relationship back in high school, if you can even call it that, and never tried dating while in school since. Also tried one blind date through a friend as an adult and never again. I’ve always been extremely introverted - I really enjoy my alone time - I have no problems spending time alone at the library, playing video games, or visiting the gym. I love my time with friends, but eventually, I get overwhelmed and need my space.

I also have debilitating social anxiety accompanied by low self-worth, something I’ve struggled with since childhood. Dating sounds like absolute terror to me. Putting myself out there to be judged by others, having to meet someone I don’t know and talk to them while trying NOT to be self-conscious and awkward - I get the sweats just thinking about it.

“But the other person is just as nervous as you are! YOU are also the one doing the judging and possibly rejecting - “ yes, yes, and I dread THAT, too. I’ve always been a people pleaser and hyper-aware of other people’s feelings, I would hate to be the one to hurt someone else or make them feel terrible by rejecting them, too. I would do it, then regret it for days, possibly weeks or even months after, even if I barely know them, as crazy as it sounds. I hate hurting others, I just want everyone to be happy.

Oh, and I also fear what would happen if it all works out. Of actually meeting someone I care about, and having them actually return those feelings, is also absolutely terror-inducing. Of eventually being intimate with them (I am a virgin, social anxiety again, big shocker there), and of opening my heart to someone else. Not only do I fear it would never last after I already opened up to them, I also worry about damning them to an entire life having to deal with me when they could be happy with someone better.

For the record, I am in therapy, so I am working on those above feelings…but I want to learn to be “Single and Happy”, as I look longingly over at that subreddit. But I got constant pressure from friends, loved ones, even coworkers saying things like “but you’re so beautiful/kind/amazing, there’s someone out there for you, \*I\* was nervous once too but you just gotta put yourself out there!!” and my parents being all “you’re going to regret it, we don’t want you to end up alone, you deserve someone!”

So, naturally, I got that FOMO, especially after seeing my best friend/roommate (with whom we always joked together about being single gals together) find the love of her life and even excitedly talking about marriage. I worry I am making a big mistake by not trying harder to date, but…I just can’t. Hopefully in therapy, I can learn to be at peace with staying single forever, but right now, I just feel like a freak. Thanks for listening.",1765926368.0,socialanxiety

1pofnkt,"My feeling of loneliness is no longer temporary it's gone beyond that, it's become a routine","At some point, being alone stopped feeling temporary. It just became my normal.
There were no messages to reply to, no plans to cancel, no one really checking in. My days started blending into each other — wake up, do what I need to do, kill time somehow, sleep, and do it all again. Not because I wanted to be alone, but because trying to connect felt exhausting and risky.
What’s strange is how easy it is to get used to it. You don’t walk around thinking “I’m lonely.” You just stop expecting connection. You move through the day quietly. Loneliness slowly turns into routine.
The hardest part wasn’t the silence itself. It was the feeling that I was fading out of people’s lives, like I could disappear and no one would really notice.
Most days, I’m still alone. That part hasn’t suddenly changed. But I’ve stopped telling myself this is just who I am, or that it means there’s something wrong with me. It’s not a personality trait. It’s something that built up over time.
If your life feels quiet in a way that hurts, you’re not broken. And you’re not the only one living like this, even if it feels that way.
Sometimes the first step out of isolation isn’t suddenly making friends. It’s realizing that loneliness became your default , and admitting that you want something else.",1765924064.0,socialanxiety

I’m not even mad about my grade. I’m just upset at myself for not even being able to stand up and try. It feels like everytime I improve I end up getting worse.

None of my friends are putting the same amount of effort into me as I am them. I just bother everybody and I can’t even make eye contact. I wish I could just disappear for a week or two and take a break.

1podw50,social anxiety but only with roommates?,"having some roommate-related frustrations and when i google my issues i keep ending up here (as opposed to somewhere like a roommates subreddit). wondering if i should take it as a sign.

for context: i struggle to leave my room when i think my roommates might be out and about in the shared space—i skip meals sometimes because of this. i feel hypervigilant, unable to have my headphones in when they're chatting because i'm eavesdropping in fear that they're saying something about me. i worry about how my daily habits come off to them e.g. if i seem lazy or unsocial, and i will go out of my way to act ""normal"" (like pretending to leave to hang with friends when i'm really just going out by myself). the past three evenings i've all spent in the city alone because i didn't want to be home, i didn't want to seem like a shut-in, and if i left the house i could have dinner outside instead of cooking or eating dinner with my roommates. whereas if i lived alone i would feel no guilt spending those evenings staying in. 

is this a common roommate struggle or a sign of social anxiety? i don't think i struggle significantly with social anxiety in other scenarios (i guess sometimes but not to a debilitating or continuously frustrating degree). i have depression but i always thought i only had a ""normal"" amount of anxiety so i never considered something like an anxiety disorder. but should i be concerned??",1765919857.0,socialanxiety

1podrsd,"I miss my old self, the one who used to act naturally when meeting people."," One of the hardest things about social anxiety for me isn’t even the fear . it’s feeling like I’m not the same person I used to be.
Sometimes I look back at old videos or messages and I barely recognize myself. I used to talk easily, joke without thinking, just exist around people without overanalyzing everything. Now it feels like that version of me disappeared. Conversations don’t flow anymore. I pause too much, overthink every word, or say things that feel stiff and unnatural.
It’s not that I don’t have thoughts or things to say.
They just don’t come out the way they used to.
For a long time, I kept trying to force myself back into who I was before. I pushed myself to be louder, more social, more “normal.” All it did was make me feel worse, like I was constantly failing at being myself.
What helped, at least a little, was realizing that I’m just not that version of me right now. And that doesn’t mean I’m broken. It means something shifted, and my body and mind are still adjusting.
I stopped chasing how I used to be and let conversations be slower and quieter. I stopped expecting myself to sound confident or interesting all the time. I stopped comparing every interaction to the past.
I don’t feel natural again —,not really.
But I also don’t feel like I’m pretending all the time.
And honestly, that feels like progress.
If you ever feel like you lost yourself socially, you’re not alone. Sometimes it’s not about going back to who you were ,it’s about slowly learning how to live as who you are now.

My family environment is very unstable emotionally. There isn't constant fighting, but there is tension, silence, and behavior that slowly wears you down. The people in my family are struggling in their own ways, and even though no one is intentionally trying to hurt me, their actions and emotional patterns affect me deeply. Living in this atmosphere for years has left me anxious, exhausted, and emotionally overloaded.

Along with that, I struggle with social anxiety in almost all social situations. I freeze when I have to talk. I can't maintain eye contact. I overthink every word. Even when I want to connect, my mind goes blank and my body shuts down. 

I'm also under a lot of pressure about my own life : my future, my studies, feeling stuck, feeling behind, and it feels like I'm dealing with family stress, anxiety, and self-doubt all at the same time. It's too much for one person.

I want to heal and understand myself instead of just surviving. I've started journaling and painting to cope, but I know I need support too. Right now, I don't have anyone I can share these things with due to personal circumstances, even though I used to. That's why I'm reaching out here.

1pnyt8l,Is my communication style why my 5-year friendship is falling apart?,"Hi, for some time I have been struggling with stress caused by a change in the style of my relationship with a friend I have known for 5 years. This is a truly important relationship for me. We met on Roblox, it was never a very close relationship, we didn't write every day, but we wrote every now and then. Whenever we wrote, we had a lot of things to talk about. Our conversations could last for hours. We always trusted each other and wrote literally about everything. I would like to write like we used to again, but I don't know what to do.

However, for about half a year I feel that something has changed. Whenever I write, the replies are kind of dry. My friend doesn't write about herself as much anymore. Before, literally from a conversation about how to cut carrots, we could take it in any direction. Now when I write about studies, life, music, I get a few short replies like ""aha"", ""okay"", ""mhm"". Sometimes, admittedly, she tells me something about herself, but she doesn't try to continue the conversation.

My anxiety got worse since I added her on IG and I see that she doesn't read messages so quickly, or she reads them and doesn't reply to them. I wouldn't have a problem with this if I didn't see that she is online on TikTok or IG and reposts different things, so she clearly has time to at least reply. I can't remember if this happened because of some behavior of mine or if it's just automatic. I only know that once we argued because she forgot about a game with me and I was really angry about it, but it seems to me that our conversation was already a bit dry then.

I also went to a psychologist recently. I am a person with traits of the autism spectrum. I also have a problem with small talk. I very often write about myself, I write mainly about my interests, and I write really a lot. I am also sensitive to every smallest change in contact, hence my worry. I wonder if it is simply my fault and if the problem lies in the fact that I write too much, because I wrote so much before, and yet we wrote all the time. Recently when we were writing, she mentioned a male friend and said she writes with him literally about everything. I don't know if she writes with him a lot or like with me. When I confronted her about this, she said she has depression and takes medication. She also has Spectrum traits. This is why she replies to me like this. I don't question that she likes me because we still play games and I'm in her close friends on IG.

I know that my communication style is intense and monologue-like. However, what is crucial for me: for a week I have been writing with another person from university and despite the same, intense style, I receive a lot of initiative back from her, I feel engagement, and we talk fluently. This confirms my belief that the problem with my friend is something other than just me. Do you think she stopped liking me, or is this just her avoiding a close relationship (breadcrumbing)? Should I withdraw from this friendship, or fight for contact?",1765881560.0,socialanxiety

1pnw5wz,Anyone here with anxiety have experience with guanfacine XR?,"I’m an adult with anxiety (no ADHD) and looking into guanfacine XR. I’m interested in something that helps calm an overactive nervous system without making me feel flat or overly sedated.

I’ve tried very low-dose clonidine, which actually helped, but I’m curious whether guanfacine XR might be a smoother or more sustainable option long-term.

My biggest concerns are fatigue and motivation. I can manage anxiety reasonably well, but I don’t want something that leaves me wiped out, foggy, or emotionally blunted. Since clonidine helped, I’m especially interested in how guanfacine XR feels by comparison.

For those who’ve taken guanfacine XR: • Did it help with anxiety or physical tension? • How bad was the fatigue, and did it improve over time? • Any impact on focus, motivation, or mood? • Did XR feel smoother than clonidine or beta blockers?",1765870901.0,socialanxiety

1pntvru,Burnt out and have to tell my boss about a schedule change,"I teach private lessons at a music school where I can technically make my own schedule but doing the scheduling is managed by the front desk staff and managers. Basically, when I first got hired I took as many hours I could get because I needed the money. (I learned my lesson now that adding hours is way easier than taking them off). 

Then, I got accepted into grad school so now I teach lessons 5 days a week and go to class on the 6th. I’m beyond burnt out after 1.5 years of having my schedule packed to the point where I’m having a hard time taking care of myself. My executing functioning used to be good but has gone out the window lately. I was considering quitting altogether but in this economy I’d dread finding a brand new job. 

Basically, I have to tell my boss tomorrow that I’d like to cut 8 hours off my schedule and I’m super anxious about it. I’ve been thinking about it for weeks and I’m not entirely sure what I’m going to say or how much detail to go into. I also feel guilty that it’s creating more work for them to move students around. I’m giving them 1 month heads up but it’s right before the holidays. 

Context: The boss/front desk staff have a long history of scheduling over my breaks (accidentally?) which has also made me dread having this conversation. This is also not the first time I’m requesting a schedule change (before it was due to grad school courses).

1pnst2y,Nobody cares about me. Any suggestions?,"Well, I’ve been feeling really bad this last month because my friend never answers my messages. He always leaves me on seen. You could think, “Well, maybe he’s busy or something like that,” but then I see him texting in the group chat and I have to ping him there saying, “Check your DMs.” It’s so annoying to have to remind him ALL THE TIME. I explained this situation to him like three times, and he only told me that I have to relax. The last time, he didn’t even answer my message.

I’m starting to think that at some point he hates me, but he says that’s not true. It’s strange because he still invites me to hangouts with our friends, but I don’t know. The other day I invited him to hang out, but he said he didn’t want to because the day was too hot. Two days later, we hung out with more people on a day with the same temperature.

This situation feels really bad, and I also hate that people NEVER text me first. I always have to start the conversation. Another thing that annoys me is that another friend (who I don’t really care about) confused my name. Today he told me he didn’t want to play videogames because he wanted to go to sleep, but later I saw him playing videogames. I asked him about it and he said he couldn’t and didn’t want to play again. Like, bro, wtf.

But the thing that makes me the most angry is that in my country we’re on holidays. Like, bro, what are you even doing to be so busy?

1pnjbku,I... went to grocery store last week,"I know, seems rather **innocolous**. Although, many of you here know such **simple task** can be eventful and **daunting** for a person with **social anxiety**. I usually **avoid** going to the store, and just cook from the food my family brings home. But, that day I was **determined** to buy food myself. 

My brain did what it **always does** and had me **over analyzing** and racking up **awkward scenarios**, not knowing **where to put my hands**, feeling awkward around a group of women likely **my age** walking by, or if it's rude to **stare** at someone's **general direction** while I'm waiting for them to **finish** checking out (self checkout). And if **you're wondering**. It is rude, so I **turned around** to mind my own business. 

Anyways, aside from those moments. Something a **bit interesting** happened. I always sort of struggle when it comes to **hiding my feelings** and this is true for social situations as well. So I imagine I **look a bit timid** when letting the guard check my receipt. Anyways, when I was **putting away my basket**, It got stuck and I **verbally muttered** something to myself before picking my bags up and leaving because I **felt so embarrassed**. I wasn't about to **sit there** and calmly make sure the basket would **stack nicely** after already **feeling** people were looking at me. 

An **older gentlemen** who happened to be **behind me** was talking to the guard when this happened. I **heard him** make a comment about how I must've decided to **""let the workers do their job""**, sort of implying I was being a bit **stuck up**. You know, like the people who leave **food out in the isle**, or their **carts in the parking lot**. This combined with the **laughter** I heard moments ago when my cart was stuck must've **internally** made me a bit **insecure**. So I just wanted to **get out** of there. 

I noticed **that guy** who was previously **behind me** was almost by **my side**, he is pushing the cart a bit **slow**. I decide to walk **a bit faster**, so I can **get out** because he has a cart and it doesn't make sense for **two people** to walk through together. So I speed up and **walk past him**. 

To which he says to me something like: **""don't play with me""**, or it wasn't even that exactly, but that was the sentiment. But essentially maybe he thought I was **being rude** and trying to **""test him""** when I quickly **walked past** temporarily perhaps causing him to **slow down**?? And of course I **keep walking** without looking back to which he says **""yeah, keep walking""** and chuckles to himself.

I don't understand why **men** have to constantly think everything is some **social heiarchy game** where any **man**, or fuck it let alone anyone **inhabiting a male** body is trying to **""test""** them.

There was no reason to make those comments after **already laughing at me** with the guard. I'm clearly some **awkward person** who's not a **real threat** to you, I wasn't even looking at you.

 I didn’t expect it to slowly creep into my everyday life — even at home with my own family.
Simple things started to feel heavy.
 Small talk at dinner.
 Answering a question.
 Just being in the same room.
Nothing bad was actually happening, but my body acted like something was wrong.
What helped wasn’t forcing confidence or trying to act normal. I realized that anxiety doesn’t mean I don’t care — it just means my nervous system is overwhelmed.
So I stopped trying to perform socially at home. I aimed for neutral instead.
Some days that meant sitting quietly without explaining myself.
 Answering briefly, but honestly.
 Staying in the room a little longer than usual, then leaving without guilt.
No speeches. No pressure to be interesting. No pretending.
Little by little, my body stopped reacting like these moments were dangerous.
 They didn’t become amazing or easy — they just started to feel safe.
If social anxiety is affecting even your closest relationships, you’re not broken. It usually means your system needs gentleness, not more pressure.
You don’t have to fix everything at once. Sometimes progress is just staying a little longer, exactly as you are.

However it’s just occurred to me today very very clearly that I’m afraid of big groups of people I don’t know, or rather like groups that have an unknown vibe, as im very careful of everything to not go against the vibe, so I end up very avoidant and hide away. 

But once I kinda get inside the group as in say like part of the conversation, I’m all goods it’s just the getting into the group part is scary? I don’t know I thought I’m past this but clearly I’m not. 

I always end up only joining a group with a connection to any individuals that seem more approachable and like one on one conversations. But in reality I really really want to just join the group when I can, as individuals being separated from the group is very specific  and won’t happen a lot. 

So what are some tips or maybe things I should practice on? Or do I just need to confront my fear the next time.

Well, now I have to give a presentation to a board as part of this job and it's making me feel like I'm going to die. I knew this was a thing when I got the job, but I thought for some reason that I'd be okay because I know the job and the department. But I am not okay. I am so not okay. 

A GP has prescribed me short term propranolol and thats helping me not feel as sick and shaky but I still feel so so much dread and terror. 

It's the presentation itself and also the unknown of what kind of questions might be asked. The chair of the board is a scary man and I'm terrified he'll be rude to me and then I'll stress cry in front of 15 of the most senior people in my organisation. 

It has crossed my mind to go off sick this week, because the physical and mental distress is insane, but I feel so pathetic and I'm worried about the repercussions from my workplace. My manager can be really friendly but I'm unsure if she'd understand and it doesn't fix the problem of having to do this again next year as it's an annual review of my team. 

I actually hate myself just now. I hate that I'm like this. I hate that I have two more days of existing in this state before battling through the intense fear of the presentation before finally finally getting some relief. I am so exhausted and overwhelmed and it feels like I've been like this for weeks. 

Does anyone have any words of reassurance or advice or anything? I want to disappear. Just pack up and go. It feels like anything would be better than living in this heightened state of dread and stress. ",1765793124.0,socialanxiety
1pn26ao,Why do i randomly get social anxiety while other times I'm good?,"Hi, im 24M. I was a very confident and happy person when I was a kid. i still feel like i have that part of me, but something messed me up i guess. when i was a kid, i moved to a different country and the culture shock was real. i didn't feel it at the time, but i found that the kids in my school had very different interests than me. i lived in a pretty conservative culture before, so when i moved and saw the kids were more ""free"" and did a lot of things like talking about girls and music all the time was something i didn't really know about. don't get me wrong, my life before wasn't closed off and everything was taboo or anything, it just wasn't many of people's interests. i was also like 10 at the time, so either way i would still be new to listening to music and talking about girls. regardless, i had a little trouble making friends first, especially close ones. i was good in school and kids and teachers quickly noticed me, and that boosted my confidence. yet i still couldn't make close friends. i now see that my personality isn't really a charismatic one and i don't talk alot. that's part of it i think. anyway, throughout high school and even before, i started experiencing some bullying but i always gave a tough view to everyone and challenged people and was able to stand my ground most of the time. internally though, i think that's how my social anxiety started. i would go everyday thinking about how i would need to prove myself today and who would i need to fight off.

to get to the point, nowadays i feel like i get a few days where i feel like myself and i can crack jokes and be social, while the rest of the days i feel tired and anxious, even if i wear the tough/confident mask, and i cannot function normally because of it. i know that people who know me well know that i am kind of weird or that i can't hold a conversation but it's because that small window of socializing confidence is too small for them to get. it feels overwhelming as i get bored alot of the time and i feel that family members whom i respect sometimes have this kind of ""disappointed"" look as they wanna see me excel and want to know me better but i have trouble expressing myself.

i feel like i have a chance to fix this but it's been years at this point and i am learning as i am growing but how long do i need to wait. life is passing by me and i feel like I'm missing out.

1pn23fb,How to overcome social anxiety?,"Hey everyone. I’m not shy, but talking to people (especially new ones) makes me really anxious and completely drains my energy. During conversations I feel tense, and after I’m done I need to take deep breaths like I was holding everything in.

It feels very physical; tight chest, shallow breathing; and it’s starting to stop me from opportunities because I avoid talking to people. I really want to get better and not feel like social interaction costs me this much energy.

I present as confident because I’ve been stuck with this disease for a long time and have learned how to fake it. However, my body is suffering from the lack of food and sleep and I want to be kind to it! 

also out of curiosity, if anyone has taken them, are doctors usually okay with prescribing them? I hate a weird conversation with a medical professional.

1pmxf72,Growing up poor and carrying shame — trying to finally let it go,"I grew up in a poor family and often had to work hard to help out. Our home, furniture, and yard were modest, and sometimes we didn’t have enough for food or clothes. I hated that life and would go to bed wondering, “Why me? Why is it like this?”

I used to resent my mom for it — though now I’m proud of her, it’s hard for me to tell her that I love her and would give her anything if I could.

All of this made it impossible for me to feel relaxed or live normally. Even now, I find myself envying people who grew up worse off but don’t carry the same shame.

I want to finally overcome this, leave the past behind, and stop lying to myself. I want to live without fear and do what I truly want.

It’s not every class I’m scared of. I can attend classes where I’m not expected to talk. But classes in which I’m expected to talk, I have an insanely strong fear

It’s not just class either. I hadn’t seen my brother in like a year. My mom told me he was coming to visit with his family. I was extremely nervous and had to go buy alcohol in preparation since I was expected to make small talk instead of staying in my room the whole time. I had to drink just to work up the courage to speak to my brother for 30 minutes. I don’t even like alcohol. In fact ever since I stopped attending classes, I haven’t had a sip of alcohol nor felt the need to. I’m not addicted to alcohol. I just drink because it’s the only state in which I can somewhat attend classes.

I know it's irrational but I can't help it, my brain just goes into panic mode thinking about saying something stupid.

Lately I've been trying to push myself a little because honestly I'm tired of playing everything solo, feels really lonely sometimes. Tried joining a few discord servers but they're either dead silent which makes it worse, or way too chaotic to start. Couple weeks ago I tried game nights with strangers but there's someone hosting it so they guide the conversation and I don't feel like I have to carry the convo, I’ve been going to these ludio sessions and I’m starting to feel more confident, me not trying to figure how to keep the conversation going reliefs me a bit, I still get anxious before joining and sometimes when there is more people.

1pmue01,Why am I like this?,"My whole life I've more or less been an outcast, from elementary to high school I used to practically never speak at all to the point where people would wonder if I was mute, especially early on I couldn't even speak when asked questions by teachers, as I grew older I began to be able to speak in more formal scenarios, but to this day even as an adult I find it impossible to hold a casual conversation or gain friendships, my mind goes blank, I give one word responses and the other party quickly realizes how utterly uninteresting I am. 

Barring my immediate family I have no one to confide in and in recent times I've even grown distant from them and It's starting to dawn on me how I've wasted some of the best years of my life friendless and alone, that I've missed out on so many experiences because of my inability to open up to others. As a child I used to tell myself that I preferred being alone that I was happier that way, in the end it deprived me of practically any social skills that I could have used to change myself. Life is a boring slog, I have things to keep me entertained but at the end of the day I'm left unsatisfied and unfulfilled.

And I can't help but wonder, why me? What went wrong in life for me to turn out this way? I had good parents, a good home life, I've never been diagnosed with Autism or any other such disorder, why was it so hard for me to speak from the very beginning? 

My younger sister was born to the same parents, was raised under the same circumstances and even as a child she was more confident and socially capable than I've ever been, It's like she lives in another world, I saw her chatting up a complete stranger so casually that I'd initially assumed they were friends or at least acquaintances and I can't help but feel a tinge of jealousy, why couldn't I have turned out like that? Why have I been cursed with this miserable existence? It's irrational of course and self-centered to assume to that she doesn't to have struggles of her own and yet a part of me can't help but feel that way.

Every time I try to reach out, I end up stumbling over my own words or have nothing interesting to offer, people are taken aback by my awkwardness and even a slightly confused look makes me feel ashamed and embarrassed, I'm so disconnected from normal society that it genuinely feels impossible for me change.

Anyways, there was a party being advertised at various highschools in my area so I bought a ticket (cuz clubbing is supposed to be fun and it would have been sort of an exposure therapy) expecting some people from my class to also be there. However the tickets sold out quickly so those who did say that they'd be going ended up not, and I was the only one from my class going to the party. So I almost didn't go, however, I pulled myself together and went there anyways, alone (since I knew that there'd still be people from my school, whom I know and cuz I paid for the ticket) and when I reached there, I found a group of kids from my school, with whom I talk rarely but who welcomed me anyway. And I drank a bunch of alcohol in the waiting line (which I guess is why my anxiety symptoms lessened). And once inside I saw them dancing uninhibited on the dancefloor so I joined them and had the time of my life.

I had never been to a club before, so this was all knew to me, and I also kinda regret not ever having experienced such stuff earlier (like a lot of people my age have done). But I loved shouting the lyrics of the songs the DJ played, and jumping & dancing along together with the other ppl from my school.

Once I started getting ready to get home at 3am, some girls from my school (who were also getting ready to go home) asked me some stuff, (I don't remember what exactly) since they know me as the quiet kid, but I was actually quite open that night.

im a 21 year old guy and ive had social anxiety since i was in my early teens. it slowly got worse over time especially during the pandemic but its at its worse. i went to a relatively small school so i knew everyone there since kindergarten so making friends wasn’t something i had to do. i kept the same friends my whole life and when i moved to uni i found it impossible to make friends. im too anxious to talk to people and i have no idea how to start conversations. i adapted a mindset of only speak when spoken to which ruined me further. any conversation i have now is short and surface level and I don’t know how to bring it further. because of this conversations bring me a lot of anxiety and I try to avoid them always. i know how bad this is and its killing me and i have no idea where to start. i know therapy is a start but i have so much anxiety with therapists i don’t know how i could do it. i do have a psychiatrist and am on ssri and anti anxiety. the ssri sorta helped me im able to go out in public and cosplay as a person lol and was even able to get a job which surprised me but all i ever really want is friends and a social circle or somebody to talk to and it feels impossible to get. i have tinder and i get a decent amount of matches but I never start conversations and the conversations I do have are short lived. the reason I don’t start conversations is because you only have one shot at starting it and i don’t wanna fuck it up with a bad start and ruin it. i feel like im still in a good position to fix my life but i just have so much anxiety about everything all I can do is hide in my room and not talk to anyone. I get scared of notifications. i also smoke a lot of carts which make me really paranoid and enforce this avoid-isolate mindset. im scared of everything and i don’t know what to do every day is just miserable and it feels like the life i want is just out of reach. i know I should stop smoking carts and i did stop for work and surprise surprise my anxiety got a lot less worse but everything is so boring without it. i feel like if i had something else going on my life I wouldn’t smoke it as much but i have literally nothing going on so im just home bored in my room all the time. i need to get out and stop but don’t know what to do. anyways if u read this far thanks for listening to me yap

I didn’t know whether to hug or just smile and say hi. So I went in for a hug with my uncle because my sister and mom hugged him as a greeting too, and right as I went in for the hug my mom walked right in front of me. It was _so_ awkward. Like I was super eager to hug him when really I just tried to act nice/normal.

I am on a special diet so I brought my own snacks (there were lots of snacks for everyone else and I didn’t want to stick out), but the anxiety was so bad I couldn’t bring myself to plate my food or even take a bite out of it. I ended up just pouring myself a glögg (it’s like a spiced Christmas drink) and to my disappointment it contained no alcohol. I just wanted to numb the anxiety.

Then when I sat down with my cousins, I felt too awkward to ask about their lives or to speak about myself. I always feel awkward for the reason I am 23 and still haven’t finished highschool. I felt so awkward/anxious I wanted to cry. I could feel the tears pushing in my throat and I avoided eye contact. I was also worried cousins and others would notice how skinny I’d become and judge me for it (anxiety has made me skinny, but it’s not a severe weightloss it’s just that I don’t look completely healthy anymore).

He brings his kids over to my neighbor's house to visit him and my kids go play with his even they're over. I've liked him from afar for a couple of years but situation never really aligned to make a move. I tried about a year and a half ago but lost interest when he would be flirty over FB messenger but had no follow through. So I hadn't SEEN him in person for probably 7 months and during that time I've lost a bunch of weight and had a bit of a glow up. I happened to be coming home at the same time he was leaving my neighbor's house and he stopped and chatted for a few and appeared to be lingering a bit. I went in the house and he went on his way and not long after I noticed he was ""liking"" some of my pictures and posts. I thought I should reach out to him again so I sent a flirty GIF of the pink rabbit in robinhood waving her ear flirting with robinhood and he responded with a GIF of thumper excitedly thumping his foot. 

One thing led to another and I invited him over to my house to cuddle me and get back tickles and just chill. HE ACTUALLY CAME OVER, but told me during the cuddling that he was so nervous on his way over that he considered asking me if I had any alcohol so he could have a shot to relax. I asked why he was so nervous and he said he's got social anxiety. I asked if he was still nervous and he said yes but we kept cuddling and running hands all over each other. As he was leaving I told him I'm off Wednesday off he wants to do it again and we tentatively made a plan. He said to call him. 

The next day I realized I don't actually have his phone number so I sent him ""*number* if you want it.  😀"" and he didn't respond or text me. Later that night I sent ""👋 Hey, I just wanted to tell you that I know it was hard for you to come over yesterday with your anxiety going. I really appreciate you pushing through it and coming through. Anxiety sucks. I'm quite familiar with the old worry that I've done or said something dumb and revisiting everything I said to people that day to make sure I didn't upset anybody. 

Anyway, fighting those demons is tough and you kicked it's ass.

Don't ever worry about bothering me either. I'll probably bother you before you bother me.""

 Now keep in mind all he would have seen on his notification was ""👋 Hey, I just wanted to tell y...""
But he didn't even open the message. Later in the day the next day I sent ""Is it Wednesday yet?"" And shortly after that he opened and put heart reacts on both of those two messages. But didn't say anything. Knowing he's socially anxious but not knowing to what degree i just figured he didn't know what to say to that. So I let another day go by before saying ""Happy Friday! I hope the rest of your week went well."" And he responded about his week being mostly good besides having a sick kid. 

Anyway... I just wrote him ""Hey there, Mr. *name* 😍 We’re halfway to Wednesday. I could definitely go for more cuddles with you."" And he opened it and didn't say anything. 

Does this sound like disinterested energy or does it sound like he's overwhelmed and not sure what to say? Am i being too much? On the one hand I feel like it's mostly been back and forth and not ""clingy"" but on the other hand with somebody socially anxious is he thinking I'm smothering him with my once a day messages?

Because honestly, I'm very proud of my progress.

But, I noticed that I often end up lying unintentionally when I'm talking to people (mostly in a group setting, I don't panic or get embarrassed or anxious when talking to someone 1 on 1). either because I panic, or because my mouth moves faster than my thoughts. It gets worse when I’m drinking. Even if I’m not drunk or tipsy, I become more “confident,” which basically means I talk faster and talk more. I know I need to talk less, but I’ve spent most of my life hating being ignored or dismissed.

Now my problem feels like the opposite of before. Maybe I feel too confident. And I talk too much, and while rambling is one thing, I sometimes end up exaggerating or saying things that aren’t true without meaning to. Often it’s just small details, but sometimes it's not so minor. But it's never intentional, and never something that matters. I feel like a liar, but correcting myself later is a lot weirder. I don’t know how to phrase things accurately, or I blank out, panic, and mix things up. At the moment, I genuinely believe what I’m saying is true, but later I realize it wasn’t.

1pmiurb,Is my psychiatrist fuc**ing me over?,"

Hi everyone, I’m writing because I’m really confused and I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if my concerns are actually valid.

I’m 24, and for about 4 years I’ve noticed a major drop in sexual desire and “functioning.” I used to get aroused easily, and sometimes I’d even get anxious talking to someone because I liked them so much. Now it feels like I experience very little, if any, sexual attraction, and in general my orgasms also feel much weaker.

At first I thought it was just stress and I ignored it, but over time it started to weigh on me. So I went through several appointments with different endocrinologists. At one point they suspected a condition (which I won’t name for privacy), but it was later ruled out. After repeating tests multiple times, my sexual hormone levels (testosterone, etc.) have generally been normal. The last endocrinologist told me that, in her opinion, it made sense to rule out a major biological cause and recommended psychotherapy with a psychiatrist/psychotherapist who’s very well known in my city and is also a sexologist.

I was very reluctant. I’ve always been a “controlled” person, calm, I almost never get angry, and overall I’ve always managed my life without major issues, so the idea of starting therapy felt very far from me. But I agreed both because I didn’t want to rule anything out and because, when you’re young and have sexual problems, doctors often dismiss it as “anxiety” and that’s it. I wanted to be able to say I’d explored that route too, so I’d be taken more seriously by doctors.

I started in September. The treatment is very expensive and, honestly, it doesn’t seem to be helping with the main issue. Sexually, I haven’t noticed any improvement. In other areas, maybe a little, some self esteem improvement, and for the first time in my life I’m starting to feel the urge to come out to my parents (I’m also attracted to men and they don’t know). But after months, regarding the problem that brought me there, I see no results and I still think it might be more physical than psychological.

Here’s the main point. In my last session I talked about two things:

•	I’ve always had difficulty with physical contact. If someone hugs me, I often tense up and pull away. My friends know this.
•	Talking through different situations, we concluded I might have mild social anxiety. I actually agree with that. It’s not disabling, I have a normal life, I go out, I have friends, I can talk to people, and I’ve lived on my own for 5 years. But in certain contexts (new environments, new activities, meeting new people) I struggle more, and I definitely have some anxiety issues.

What shocked me is that, basically out of nowhere, my psychiatrist suggested starting a medication: sertraline. I was stunned. It felt like a huge leap, from “mild social anxiety” and a sexual issue that I still don’t convincingly connect to psychology, to prescribing me an SSRI. And to be clear, she herself confirmed that I don’t have mood disorders, and up until now she hadn’t even mentioned medication.

I tried to express my concerns, but she insisted it was the right choice and wanted me to start literally the next day.

When I vaguely mentioned it to my parents (without going into detail), they got scared and had more or less the same concerns as me. Also, online I read that sertraline is an SSRI and that it’s known for potentially worsening sexual functioning, which really freaks me out since I’m going there specifically for that problem.

Of course I’ll talk to her again, but she seemed very determined and that made me lose trust. I already had some doubts during the process, but this really threw me off. I’m seriously thinking about stopping, both because I’m not seeing sexual improvements and because I don’t feel comfortable with this prescription.",1765731368.0,socialanxiety
1pminmr,Considered Gay at workplace.,"Hi guys, just to give a little context, I recently joined the new company, and it is a sales job. So, many a times during training, I had to give presentation infront of 40-50 people, repeatedly for many days.

And I had a severe social anxiety where my voice gets very thin, and I start to act awkwardly, for examples use of hand gestures.

This gave the impression that I was gay, also I would stay silent, and don't talk most of my colluges, except one guy, whom I met first day of the training, we have been having lunch together, going on breaks. This guy, then start spreading rumour that I am gay. I realised it very late, when most of office now consider me as gay.

In my office everyone seems to indirectly make a fun of me, although being gay is not problem, but when you are straight, it really hurts.

Now I am thinking of quitting my job, as it has really spread like anything, and now I am being judged like anything at my work place. I believe I should have never joined a sales job, although I am good at what I do.

Second mistake, I did I shared some personal information with that person, which kind of give him the authority to claim, what ever he wants about me.

Third mistake, I didn't interact with most of my batch mates and he was getting along with everybody.

I just want to beat the shit out of him.

Now onwards, I would not share any personal information with any colleagues, as they are not friends some can be snakes also.

Edit: I forget to tell, the other day, I was at my desk, working, and my team was not present, and out of nowhere a guy approached me, and it shattered me like any thing, now guys are showing intrest in me, it is getting very toxic.",1765730891.0,socialanxiety

1pmhegg,How the hell does one navigate work/organization type of parties?!,"Parties in general are so difficult for me. I had two parties in the past few weeks with an organization I'm involved with. I'm not talking about a wild party at someone's house with booze and drugs everywhere, I'm talking about an adult social event type of thing. 



The first one: I got to the place which was like an arcade thing with all kinds of games and entertainment and bowling. I just stood against the wall and nobody talked to me. I had to leave after 15 minutes despite everyone else bowling, doing karaoke, playing pool, etc. I don't know how to penetrate the little groups of 3-4 people talking in a circle. What do I do, just walk up and insert myself? Feels so awkward and my heart was pounding. I went and sat in the car for an hour, came back in, spent another 15 minutes standing there talking to nobody, and anxiety won. I just left.

  
There was another event at a coffee shop. Again, I had to force myself to go in. I stood there and a few people talked to me, but going around introducing myself just seems impossible. This time I made it through the night because when I run away from situations I feel so much worse in the end, but I truly don't understand how people get into these little chat groups/circles. It feels like the hardest thing in the world.

  
Just ranting I guess.

1pmh3bi,Propranolol Dosage,"I’ve been trying to find a medication to help me with my major blushing issue. The last couple months I’ve been on a journey to find a medication that will help me with this. I first started on propranolol 10 mg, didn’t notice any difference. Then Propranolol 30 mg, again didn’t notice any difference. Then I tried clonidine, hydroxyzine, and most recently gabapentin. The Gabapentin has definitely improved my mood but doesn’t do much for my social anxiety and blushing. 

Today I went to church and beforehand took 80 mg of Propranolol. I found that this helped me extremely. I was able to hold conversations with numerous people after service and didn’t feel any of the symptoms of Social Anxiety. 

My question is, is 80 mg an acceptable does that a doctor would prescribe (my blood pressure is already elevated)? And how do I go about telling my doctor that I took a medication at a higher dose than what was prescribed and I’d like to switch back to that medication and dosing. 

The last time I met with my doctor he told me that the next step if Gabapentin didn’t work would be going on an SSRI which I would like to avoid at all cost since I was already on one a couple years ago and it did nothing but turn me into a zombie.

1pmfwzi,I need a job and I'm terrified,"25F, this is the situation: I dropped out of school very early and then got a diploma from a private school to enroll in university (online, of course). I've had a few jobs, and they all lasted a few months, four at most.

At home, it's just me and my mother, and she's the only one who works and pays for my university studies and generally supports me. She's always understood my situation (social anxiety, neurodivergent, introverted, and depression issues), but now I feel like I need to get out of that house and become independent. I desperately need it, especially because I can no longer live with my mother and her lifestyle.

I need to get away, but working terrifies me. I hate dealing with people I don't know. I hate being in work environments because I can't really be myself and I'm very susceptible to other people's judgments. I've always automatically ruled out jobs that have a lot of contact with the public, like waitressing, bartending, etc. Sales assistant..

Plus, I feel really ignorant about the world of work... contracts, agencies, etc. I don't understand anything and I don't know what to do. Everything seems difficult to learn, and I always feel terrible when I have to go to an interview. I'm afraid people will think I've been living under a rock until now, and that I seem stupid and easily manipulated, or simply someone to be discarded.

1pmfwyk,Kicked out of a group activity before it even began,"I've had the reddit app for so long now and never actually made an account so here I am now lol. At the time of this happening I was 19, I am freshly 20 now, this happened at the tail end of August. I had this seasonal job as a prep cook and with the way the work stations were situated, I was spending most if not all of my days with this particular coworker. For the record he was really nice and somewhat of a friend/mentor to me: this was my first kitchen job, we both have ADHD, and he was incredibly awesome with helping me out whenever I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I've had pretty bad anxiety since I was a kid (socially & performance wise) and am on meds for ADHD. It helps me a bit, and this past year or two I've been making an active effort to engage with the world around me a bit more, outside of my many comfort zones. This doesn't take away the fact that I still have very basic, at times awkward, social skills. 

I talked to this coworker with the most ease because we had similar interests, part of that being table top RPGs. Infact this is one of the first things he told me about: He was wanting to assemble a group to play his homebrew D&D and start the campaign in January. This was month 1 of that seasonal job. I like ttrpgs (mostly stick to solo one-pagers) and character creation and acting and everything, but specifically I've always wanted to play just remotely ANYTHING with a group. He said he was gonna ask some more of my coworkers that looked nerdy. I was one of the first people at that workplace that showed interest in his campaign + told him I'd love to join, and he was cool with that. 

I think a lot of us introverts/anxious folks can agree that it takes a while for us to get out of our shell and show our true selves off? I don't say this as way to soothe myself, but the more I talked to this coworker everyday the more I could obviously feel myself get more comfortable - I like to be silly and we matched eachother's stupid jokes - and even that alone helped me gain a smidge more confidence when I interacted with others. He kept bringing up his D&D campaign, always telling me who else he had managed to recruit and aside the nervousity, I was excited to start! Most of these people I already knew too. Sometimes we'd also talk about me doing art & videos for the campaign once it'd progress far enough. 

Anyways, come the week before I get laid off, we were talking about the campaign again. He was talking on for a bit about the general structure and how it was gonna work and specifically was pretty excited about the fact he managed to recruit one of our admins- somewhat close to my age and for the record, she's really nice and generally enjoyable company to be around, and has a literal acting degree from Vancouver to boot. AND loves D&D. I don't know if that factors into anything. Right after that, unprompted, he tells me, word for word, ""You're not gonna be part of the group though. Not charismatic enough."" 

Which right about killed me? I feel some sort of distressed anxiousness recalling the memory now but back then I don't think I had much of an exterior reaction outside of a quick ""Oh, haha, okay"". I still feel pretty down about it. If anything I thought I was like, being a lot better socially around him in specific, like we had a lot of laughs together and often did silly voices/character bits, so I didn't really anticipate being told this out of the blue. One of the things that frustrates me about this is that I don't know what else I could've done about it. I know some part of this I can chalk up to my conversational skill differences between English and my maternal language. I just really hate how out of the blue this came out. 

Not to get mopey, but this happens so often. I suck so bad with seeking social situations out but I do try my hardest and I've wanted friends for so long now. Every group setting or activity I've tried to integrate myself into either doesn't happen, or group falls out (or I wasn't particularly close with anyone but they all were), or includes me as a noticeable afterthought (which I wind up refusing: Not letting myself be treated like that). I try to not let myself get too down about it but the more I try the more I feel myself veering towards hating companionship as a whole and that stings. I don't blame my coworker 100% for how he wants to run his group- that still doesn't negate the hurt I felt from his comment. Even the one friend that I do have, one I used to consider my best friend, I've had my horrible issues with, and I've been intentionally withdrawing from him for his behavior. I just hate how the general loss of friendship is becoming a trend with me. 

I feel like the D&D thing specifically crushed my confidence. I thought I was making good work for myself stepping out of my comfort zone, so to be hit with what is essentially ""You're not good enough [for this thing]"" from someone I respected really stung and I've noticed I've been a lot more wary and skeptical since then. Feels like the entire dramatic, wellbeing brain in my skull is bracing itself against any new social setting that arises now and I don't like that self deprecation. 

I'm sorry for the long post. How do I learn to be more charismatic (and moreso, what does that even entail)? If anyone has any advice on coming out of their shell I'd love to hear it and, furthermore, how adults are making friends these days. Thank you for reading

Anyways, I looked it up because I have been resistant towards nearly every medication I’ve tried for my social anxiety and depression and nothing has been effective enough for me yet. I was bored and did some research and found that oxytocin (in the nasal spray form) is actually the most studied medication for social isolation and loneliness which I’ve always had but I’m reaching my peak and so depressed. I got so excited when I read that because nothing else I’ve looked into is “known for” that. Most meds I see can be effective for social anxiety, but I have that loneliness and have socially isolated myself my whole life and literally have no friends lol. So I thought this looked cool to potentially try to see if it helps.

Has anyone tried it? Not surprised if no one hasn’t, it’s almost never brought up when trying to actually find effective meds for severe social anxiety… Would love to know your experiences!

1pm6hv4,Is it Lexapro withdrawal or is this deadass just me,"Hi yall

I’m a college kid (19F) and I’ve been outgoing my whole life. I love parties, getting to know new people, and have been described by others as extroverted, but I hang out around a lot of introverts and like all kinds of people/don’t care if interactions are awkward sometimes

Now for context: Recently I’ve been getting about 4 hours (or less) of sleep a night because I’m an art student and it’s finals week. During this time I’ve been away from my apartment so I keep forgetting to take my (albeit low dose of) Lexapro. Up until yesterday it had been about six days.

Anyway let’s get to the meat now. I went to a party last night with a few people I know somewhat well from class and had a great time, no social anxiety issues, but this morning when I was invited to my best friend’s apartment for pancakes and pulp fiction I felt like I was being annoying the whole time. Every word that came out of my mouth felt stupid and like I didn’t want to say it. I was apologizing a shit ton and was constantly checking my friend’s facial expressions for a sign that they wanted me to leave, but they never told me to go and actually made me coffee. I felt so weird.

I’ve noticed that this has happened to me before, where I’ll get these random bouts of social anxiety like once every couple of months around people I know very well and have been comfortable around for years. Also the people I associate myself with aren’t even judgy— they’re wholesome nerdy art kids that are all very smart and sweet and exactly who I want to be around.

Anyways, I’m just wondering if anybody else has this same issue or if it’s just me.

Here’s what I’m thinking the potential reasons are:

Med withdrawal, anxiety might be higher (but I’ve felt this even without med withdrawal)

Fear of rejection with people that are close to me—I care about them so I’m more worried about irritating them because I don’t want to lose the people I love

Hangover-I’ve heard if you’re on Lexapro alcohol worsens depression so probably worsens anxiety too

ADHD: I don’t know if my adhd affects social interaction even in sporadic bits but I feel like a lot of weird shit is explained by my adhd so maybe that’s why

She has said she doubted my ability to do the job, which is very insulting because its a fucking grocery store job and no jobs here are actually that hard. 

There is also this one guy who I overhear complaining loudly about other coworkers quite often. He was working with another guys who I find nice and talk to sometimes. I had to go clean up vomit, which is something I cant always handle. I expressed my worry if I could handle it before going to clean it, and the one guy assumed I was asking if they could do it, I wasnt, i was more or less just complaining.

Another teacher (Ms. Kay) actually wanted to do it and offered to take my spot. Ms. Cee said they’d keep my name on the jar and have Ms. Kay get pied if I “won,” but I clearly stated I did not want my name used at all and that students needed to be told Ms. Kay was participating instead.

Despite this, my name stayed on the jar. For two weeks, announcements kept saying I was in the lead, and students told me daily they were donating so they could see me get pied. I kept telling them I wasn’t participating. I ended up “winning” for my grade. Since Ms. Cee teaches 8th grade, I emailed the 7th grade AVID teacher (Ms. S)—whose classes were the ones who nominated me—again stating I had opted out. She said it wasn’t an issue.

Yesterday morning, I asked Ms. Cee if I could stay in the bleachers since Ms. Kay was getting pied. She told me no, saying, “The kids donated for YOU.” And that I needed to show face as a courtesy. I was repeatedly told to “do it for the kids” and to “step out of my comfort zone,” even after I explained I have severe social anxiety and being the center of attention is extremely distressing for me, let alone being in a social setting such as a pep rally. I am the type of person who likes to go unnoticed, and I absolutely hate attention. They thought it would be funny to call me down and just “trick” the kids and say that I elected to have a representative. I was against this out of fear public humiliation.

At the pep rally, Ms. Cee called my name and had me stand in the center of the gym. After the cheering stopped, she announced I had opted out and that Ms. Kay would be pied instead. Immediately, the entire gym (~1,300 students) started booing and heckling me so loudly she couldn’t speak over the mic for almost a minute. I joked it off and walked away, but internally I was devastated. Afterward, students continued yelling at me, calling me a scammer and a loser, and one even flipped me off as I walked to my car. Other teachers later asked why I didn’t “just do it,” even after I explained I had set boundaries, which I hate that I even have to do. One teacher, who is extremely outgoing, had the nerve to tell me that experiencing something like that should’ve “cured my social anxiety”.

I went home, couldn’t eat, cried in the dark, and I’ve had intense anxiety and chest pain since. This is my first year at this school, and as a young, second-year teacher already dealing with high-functioning depression, this pushed me to my breaking point. I already feel overwhelmed and unwanted, and this made it worse.

I’m also angry at Ms. Cee. She was someone I trusted and saw as a mentor, and now I don’t feel emotionally safe at my school. I know pep rallies are meant to be fun, and this probably wouldn’t bother many people—but being singled out, pressured, and publicly booed has been replaying in my head nonstop. That was literally my worst fear come true.

I feel helpless, defeated, and deeply humiliated, and I don’t know how I’m supposed to walk back into that building feeling okay.

￼TL;DR: I’m a middle school teacher with severe social anxiety who clearly opted out of a “pie in the face” pep rally fundraiser. Despite repeatedly setting boundaries, my name stayed on the jar and I was forced to be called to center stage at the pep rally. When it was announced that I opted out and another teacher would be pied instead, ~1,300 students booed and heckled me, and the harassment continued afterward. I felt publicly humiliated, unsupported, and betrayed by a mentor I trusted. This pushed me to my breaking point and has left me anxious, physically unwell, and dreading returning to work.

1pltfvo,Friendship Loss & Social Anxiety,"Hi everyone, I’d like to share a bit of my experience with you.

I used to be very surrounded by people, but I’ve always had only a few close friends I could really count on (even though I still had acquaintances).

By the end of high school, that circle went from 5 people to 2.

One of them dropped me once because of her toxic boyfriend, and I stopped talking to her for two years. I eventually forgave her, only for her to do the exact same thing again a few years later.

Another friend, whom I had been close to for 8 years and who used to call me “her sister,” ended up telling me she had replaced me because she had found someone “better.”

Since then, it’s been about 4 years that I’ve been without real friends, and I slowly developed social anxiety.

I partly stopped my studies because I was constantly alone and it became unbearable.

I tried many times to make friends online, but it mostly ended in failure, with men who were more interested in flirting than building genuine friendships.

The few connections I tried to rebuild felt very one-sided, and over time I developed a strong fear of abandonment",1765653269.0,socialanxiety
1plt1rl,First date social anxiety… any tips and feeling comfortable in a relationship,"So… this is a bit of a 2 parter. Romantic and non romantic 

First sort of question/concern is I have a first date in a few days and I’m sort of bricking it. Me and this girl haven’t actually spoke that much on text. Mainly about setting up the date (I think she’s quite slow to reply) she seems enthusiastic about the date tho. So other than what’s on her Instagram I really have no clue about her (she seems nice tho). So I don’t think I have extreme social anxiety but i definitely do get anxious. Mainly my heart races and I just overthink it. Like I went to see a couple mate I haven’t seen in a few months and I was getting nervous for what? I was thinking “what if it’s awkward etc etc”. So I’ve been on 2 first dates ever one of them turned into a 6 month relationship (we did everything someone would do in a relationship) but we’re never official and then I finished uni and she lived too far away. My main thing is like what do I say. How do I not make it awkward and how do I act around her. 

The second question is about getting comfortable with someone. It’s really hard to describe but this girl I was seeing for 6 months. we didn’t really talk much which sounds bad but I just didn’t really know what to say to her. the best times were the cuddling while watching a movie or sleeping with each other but like say we’d wake up. I’d say good morning and I’d ask what her plans are for the day and then just blank…I wouldn’t know what to say. But she never made me feel 100% comfortable but that’s because both of us were pretty shy. I couldn’t be myself. I couldn’t be silly or talk a load of crap or banter that much. Like the easiest way to describe it would be say I was getting out the shower and she needed to use the bathroom. I’d like scoot out the way and there be an awkward “ooops sorry” along with an awkward laugh. I feel like it shouldn’t be like that after 6 months and I just don’t know how to 100% be myself around someone new. That goes for relationship or friendships.

I’m dealing with something that’s becoming really exhausting and I’d like to hear if anyone has had a similar experience.

I’ve asked my ex-partner, close friends, and family directly if they can smell anything bad on me, and they all say they don’t smell anything.

Still, whenever I’m around people (on the street, at university, on public transport, or at friends’ houses), I get this strong feeling that I smell bad. I notice people scratching their nose, covering their mouth, or making gestures that I interpret as reactions to a smell, and this makes me extremely anxious.

I have good hygiene:

– I shower every day

– I remove body hair

– I use deodorant

– I wear clean clothes

– I don’t smell sweat from my armpits or feet

Despite all this, the feeling that I constantly smell bad doesn’t go away and takes up a lot of my mental energy.

Could this be anxiety or something related to smell perception?

1plk41u,Is my childhood environment and upbringing caused me to be an introvert and alone ?,"Hey everyone,
I’m sharing this here because talking about it in real life usually leads to judgment or misunderstanding.

Currently, I find myself becoming very reserved, preferring minimal interaction with people. I’ve become introverted, short-tempered, emotionally drained, and under constant career pressure. I’m trying to understand whether my upbringing and home environment played a role in shaping who I am today.

I come from a typical middle-class Indian household with very strict and controlling values. Small mistakes often turn into major issues. Even at 20, I need permission for basic things like stepping out briefly. Attending college events, late-night functions, or social gatherings with friends is usually not allowed. Spending time outside studies is discouraged.

There is a strong expectation to focus only on academics and responsibilities. Once I’m done studying, I’m expected to immediately help with household work, leaving no space for rest or personal time. Privacy is almost non-existent, and even simple phone calls are questioned.

Public criticism and embarrassment have been common, often in front of relatives or others. Emotional well-being is not given importance, and discipline is seen as the only solution to every problem. Over time, this made me stop expressing myself and stay silent to avoid conflict.

Since childhood, I’ve been sincere with studies, rarely asked for anything, and avoided unnecessary expenses or demands. By most standards, I’ve been a “good” child. Despite this, I often feel controlled rather than supported. My parents follow the same parenting style they experienced growing up and believe it’s the only correct way.

My elder sibling does not support me either. We’ve never had a close or open relationship. During conflicts, instead of understanding my side, the situation often worsens.

Because of all this, home feels mentally exhausting. I often wish I could stay in a hostel or live away from home. My biggest motivation right now is to secure a job in another state and become independent.

These experiences have affected my social and professional life. I struggle with confidence, making new friends, maintaining eye contact, and social interactions in general. I’ve never been in a relationship, partly because I feel I have no control over my future decisions. I’ve developed anxiety in social situations and tend to stay silent most of the time, as I learned that speaking up only creates problems.

I don’t know how to stay calm, happy, or mentally balanced anymore. I’m considering living independently once I start working, hoping it will bring peace and stability.

I’m not posting this for sympathy or jokes. I genuinely want to understand:

Can upbringing and home environment lead to these personality traits?

How do people cope, heal, and move forward from such experiences?

1plj7v2,Dating with social anxiety,"Hi, I’m a 41-year-old male. I’ve lived with social anxiety since my teens, and because of that I’ve never really dated.

Around my early 30s, I lost weight and started putting myself out into the world a little more — nothing huge, just small steps. Most of my time is still spent helping out at my parents’ jewellery shop, where I mostly hang around and assist when needed.

Recently, I got a new puppy and started training her at the shopping centre where we’ve just opened a new store. That unexpectedly helped a lot. She became a kind of buffer for me — something to talk about — and I found myself chatting to more people. It gave me a bit of confidence, and for the first time in a long while I felt like I’d actually like to meet someone.

A couple of weeks ago, I joined four dating apps. Unfortunately, it’s been a pretty discouraging experience. I haven’t had many matches, and most people don’t seem interested in talking. I’ve tried across multiple apps, but the result has been the same.

I also live with body dysmorphia, so I already have a very low opinion of my appearance. The dating apps have sent me into a pretty brutal spiral, because they felt like my only realistic way to meet people. I don’t really go anywhere — it’s basically the shop and home every day — and I’m not someone who can just walk up and talk to strangers. So when the apps didn’t work, it left me feeling ugly, defeated, and honestly a bit embarrassed.

I haven’t told anyone I live with how much this has affected me. I wanted to do something on my own for once.

To be fair, I have had a like or two. Even though I’m 41, I look younger — most people assume I’m around 30. I don’t say that in a vain way; it’s just something I’m often told, and sometimes it actually frustrates me. I wonder if looking younger than my age works against me when it comes to dating.

I tried Tinder but deleted it almost straight away — it didn’t feel like the right place for someone with social anxiety. I’d read that Hinge was better, but honestly it feels very similar to Tinder. Maybe I’m being too picky, or unattractive I don’t know — but right now it just feels discouraging and hopeless.",1765625147.0,socialanxiety

I am in both. She’s very nice and she’s really artsy, creative, and likes weird kooky things. Along with that, she really likes fugglers and labubus. I have a labubu named Jason who has kind of become an inside joke in the theater class. For Christmas I always get her a gift, and other students do as well. I got her a labubu because she’s been wanting one for so long. The whole class stood around to see which color she got. (Purple). And when she was holding the labubu and looking at them I held out mine and we jokingly made them kiss and I said “ aww they’re married”. She said “oh!” Laughed and said “ I have a mini lafufu some one got me as well it’s called a la baby,” and I was like “aww that’s their kid, like a little labubu family” and that was all the class laughed and no one said anything about it, u til later when she referred to the labubu as a he and someone said, wait how do they have a kid?

what happens is I then wake up, & have to check (half asleep) if my valuables are still there, I know it sounds a bit humerous but this literally happens every night, I don't sleep until really late anyway (around 4am) & these dreams wake me up sometimes just minutes later, sometimes even like 5 minutes after sleeping, sometimes once i'm awake i'm not completely sure if I am or still in a dream. 

what's worse, is that a lot of the time it will happen 3-4 times the same night, with the same dream & me waking up confused, stressed & on edge. I swear up until recently I didn't even know these type of dreams even happened - growing up I knew about nightmares obviously but this is different altogether.

the dreams are never particularly scary, just so stressful & irritating because a large portion of my brean thinks it's reality.

I like anime, hockey, and art. But these are all kinda shunned or seen as weird where I am. And there’s always the constant fear of ‘what if they’re homophobic? What if they’re racist? What if they’re transphobic?’ It’s so hard because I’m so scared of the idea that theyll be sweet and then try to hurt me. I just don’t know what to do.

I (20F) am scared about playing a video game with this guy I know from online. We've been talking for nearly 6 months, we've been sending lengthy messages to each other, everything's been going well. Somewhere in September he proposed we could play a video game together, over voice chat, and I told him sure. I kept postponing it, until finally in early November, we had a short 6 minute voice call for the first time. I was extremely nervous, I cried a little bit before the call, but I pushed through it. I had a feeling of ""I'm gonna mess up and ruin everything"", sort of like... a feeling of doom, but it went fine. His native language is English and mine isn't, so that adds to the anxiety, but I also just feel very nervous talking over the phone/irl. If I get a call from a random number or something, my heart starts pounding, etc... I usually manage to act normal and everything tends to go fine if I pick up those calls or do things I'm afraid of, but I'm still afraid each time. Especially because I like this guy and I am honestly very intimidated by him.
In his last message, he said ""we should really play soon, there's nothing to be nervous about, I promise it's going to be fun"". And I feel so embarrassed. I feel like he sees through me. We both confessed we were nervous before the vc so it's not like this is new, he knows I am nervous. But the more I postpone it, the more embarrassed I will feel and the harder it will be for me to finally do this with him. 

I know the only solution is to keep pushing through these situations, but I wish it was easier. In the end, it is my hesitant behavior that is going to ruin things, not the fact that I'd be a little awkward over a voice call.

1pks3s3,I literally can’t even go to a Christmas party without wanting to leave and not want to try socializing ever again,"Idk where to even start with this. I guess I should start by saying that anxiety and depression are a part of me, pretty much. Been with me since childhood and now my 30 year old self. Never had any friends either and have pretty much spent my entire life alone (socially, I mean. I have family members that love me). Not in high school or college did I ever have a friend to talk to or hang out with. I hardly even talk to my coworkers except to say good morning or ask them about something. 

And so I decided to go to my company’s Christmas party last night, mainly because I thought that no one would recognize me (I work in a different building than most of the people there). And while that went over fine, it’s the socialization part that I couldn’t get through. Everyone in their own groups and such. “Why should I go over and talk to them? They don’t know me and I’d just be interrupting them” was basically my mindset. I stayed for about two hours before I left. 

The only thing that made the night more bearable (besides free food) was of course the alcohol. Booze and weed are legitimately the only things that even give me a nudge away from social anxiety and let me come out a bit. But of course, in our society, that’s a no-no to be dependent on a drug to function like most people do, even if you’re someone like me when Lexapro does precisely jack shit. But I digress. 

As I said, I’m 30 years old now. If I didn’t have family members wanting me to remain alive, I would’ve checked out years ago. I simply **do not care anymore**. I’m going to die and leave this world almost as if I never existed. And that’s fine. We all get forgotten about eventually. I don’t care about my life, I don’t see any value in myself and don’t care to change. 

As I said, no one will remember me anyway. So what’s the point of socializing? What’s the point of connecting with people? What’s the point of having sex if I won’t be able to perform anyway? You get the idea. ",1765546727.0,socialanxiety

He misses a salute, then 10 whole seconds pass before he comes back to ""fix it"". Whereas I would have probably thought ""ah well I messed that one up"".

It's like I sometimes view life like an actor who's only got one take to get it right. Whereas a poised person recognizes that it's in their power to rewrite the scene. Or perhaps they have a longer time horizon on which they allow themselves to be judged - something like that.

1pkpw0d,Worried About Never Being Ok Again,"I've had social anxiety for a very long time. It started when I was a teenager. About 15, I think. But was relatively mild at the start. But it increase greatly in severity after 17. Then around 22 my psychologist and I managed to improve it significantly through exposure therapy. But then after the pandemic, both due to the pandemic itself and other personal reasons, it got worse again. It's still not as bad as it was before 22. But it's worse than it was before the pandemic.

Regardless, throughout all these years of ups and downs I haven't actually been able to shake it.

It's complicated though.

I still have anxiety when using the phone, but a little bit less. Although it's mostly that I learned to deal with it better and still call.

And then when talking to people in general and just going about, my anxiety was definitely decreased significantly after exposure. It has gotten a bit worse again, but again, it hasn't returned to what it was at its height. The anxiety did remain, but at a manageable level (especially before the pandemic). But I also learned to handle it better.

And then in some situations the anxiety seems incredibly stubborn. When I was in college group work was always extremely, extremely difficult for me. Because being in a large group where I am expected to talk with many people I don't know well at once is basically the worst situation for my anxiety. And regardless of how many times I've done something like that, it hasn't really improved. My handling of it has improved a little bit, in that I can just about barely do it when I really need to. But it drains me completely afterwards. And it is extremely exhausting. So I can't do it on a regular basis.

I also know this person who plays DnD a lot with people. And it's actually something I've wanted to do for a long time. And he's even invited me before. But the thing is that I just can't do it. If I really, really needed to could I do it? Probably. But it wouldn't be any fun because it would be extremely exhausting and I would feel severely anxious the entire time. So I don't do it.

And then today... I was talking to someone on a dating app. And chatting online tends to be one of the easiest social interactions for me, especially through text, but dating apps increase the stakes. So I still tend to experience social anxiety during it. Not as much as IRL, of course. Not even close. But still enough to make things unpleasant.

Like I'm obviously thankful for any match I get. But I also really have to wrestle through sending those messages.

And it's at moments like that that I wonder about my recovery.

Because talking to people through DMs online is something I've been doing for a very, very long time. So exposure-wise I am essentially working on it constantly. But it feels like my anxiety isn't decreasing, no matter how long I do it for.

And I really want it to... It would make dating easier, at the very least.

So at the end of the day I'm left with a very complicated picture. My phone anxiety reduced a little, my handling of it got a lot better. My in person anxiety in one-on-one conversations and being out and about decrease quite a lot, and I got better at handling it. But my anxiety in groups is still as high as ever, despite exposure, and I've only barely gotten better at handling it. And then in something like chats on a dating site, the anxiety has barely moved despite significant ""exposure.""

Idk, it's confusing. And I worry about it.

I've improved, yes. But social interactions, to one degree or another, continue to be a fight. Sometimes a huge fight. I just want it to be like it was before 15, where I didn't feel any anxiety. Almost all of my life was so much easier that way.",1765539973.0,socialanxiety
1pkp2cj,"Social anxiety creeped into my life. It's gotten very bad. Can't even interact at the most superficial level. Face cramping, smiling like a creep.

It has only gotten worse. Never had a problem with it in my entire life before.  
I am suffering from mild depression since age 16 tho. For which I've taken antidepressants for 4 years total since. But I'm not on anything at the moment.

Traits of mine are introvert, low-self esteem. The quiet guy. Not being able to say no. Zero assertivity. Highly sensitive person. I never was a social guy in my entire life and interactions with people drain me mentally. ADD confirmed. 

I don't know what's happened to me. I've started getting extreme panic attacks when meeting people or being in a group. It started with meeting old friends I hadn't seen in years, expecting to talk about my life and history. It lead to me freezing up. Then it got way worse over the past years were I'm actually starting to feel lightheaded and on the verge of fainting. One time I almost fainted while talking to a girl I went to high school with and met at the library. 

I also start forced smiling (I can't even *not* smile, it's like my face cramps up into this creepy smile) and can't make any eye contact. 

I've been going to the gym for almost 15 years now, it's a solo sport and prob the reason it appealed me.   
I've been doing yoga classes in this gym for the past 3 weeks. I always sat in the back of the room. Just joining and leaving without saying anything but a 'Hi' and 'Bye'. One woman engaged in small talk with me last week for about 30 seconds and everything went ok. It felt like a victory. She even said goodbye and see you next week when passing me at the gym bar.

Yesterday evening, this same person there engaged in small talk with me after the session and once again I completely froze up, stumbling, mumbling, feeling lightheaded. I mumbled something and left the class. When she passed me at the gym bar she looked at me with a really strange face and didn't say anything. 

I just feel at a low point in my life and feel so extremely worthless I can't even interact for a minute of small talk with a stranger without completely embarassing myself.

1pki4uh,fear of being perceived— how do i get over it?,"i hope i word this in a way that is understandable so i can find some support, guidance, or even comfort knowing that someone else may struggle or has struggled with something similar.

i’m 21 years old. i’m a female, quite small, 4’8, 80 pounds. this is important because it has bothered me most of my life. i’ve struggled with eating disorders since i was young, i’ve never felt my age, i’ve never felt comfortable in my own skin. i struggle feeling like a grown woman, i struggle finding beauty in myself, i struggle with confidence, presenting myself, anything that is not cowering behind baggy clothes and keeping my presence small. i can’t stand when people look at me, i can’t stand being perceived.

this is very real and very damaging to my everyday life. i’m unsure whether or not my physical body is the full reason why i am this way, or if it’s things that have led up from my childhood up until now, but i am constantly stuck in a state of dissociation. i obsess about how i look and how i am presenting myself so often that i am never really in present time, i’m somewhere else, somewhere in a future that doesn’t exist— a version of me that never will, the version i could be in that very moment, but instead of being, i visualize it and dream about it instead of just being—because i cannot let go. i cannot be present. it has ruined my life.

i’ve never danced around anyone. i’ve never sung around anyone. the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. i’ve went to parties, i’ve went to the club. i’ve drank, i’ve smoked pot, i’ve taken molly. i’ve played my favorite songs loudly. nothing makes me feel at ease enough to be myself because i am so caught up in both how i look doing whatever it is i \*should\* be doing, and how right or wrong im doing it, but im standing there like a deer in headlights feeing nauseous instead.

i have friends who love to sing and love to dance, and with that, have tried time and time again to make me dance with them—gently, easing me, sometimes just telling me straight up to loosen up and “move my body”.. i can’t. i so badly wish i could, but i can’t. i don’t dance when im alone because i feel like im being watched even if im not. i don’t even really like to sing by myself. if i catch myself doing it i grow embarrassed. i would LOVE to do these things but i just can’t. i get emotional because i genuinely feel stuck, like i can’t move my body, i can’t force myself to open my mouth to speak let alone sing. car rides are awkward, trying to have fun with friends or a potential boyfriend is awkward. i will sing in my head and smile, but even bopping my head feel impossible and embarrassing.. so i stay still while everyone else has a good time. everyone knows me this way and they think im beyond strange— and i don’t blame them. i hate myself for this. i don’t know where to start, i don’t know what to do to make myself feel comfortable. i hate that everything feels embarrassing because i dont know how to “do it right”, even if there is no right way (especially when it comes to dancing).

to add on to sort of the same idea, i don’t drive either. i am afraid of doing the wrong thing when it comes to being taught, to being seen. i avoided sports my entire childhood because i was afraid of failure, afraid of embarrassment, afraid of not being perfect first try, afraid of being wrong. i believe the same thing is happening when it comes to having fun with others, and even by myself. i get this same impending feeling of doom whenever im being taught to drive also. i just want to cry the entire time, many times i freeze up and cant move. to make things easier on myself instead of facing it i say “i dont know how” and leave it at that. i never try, because… why would i put myself in a position to possibly fail and embarrass myself? i so desperately want to be able to at least try.. because when i don’t, i look like im not enjoying myself (or in other situations like driving.. i just look lazy). i don’t know how to just feel good, i don’t know how to not think about what others are seeing or feeling. i don’t know how to not expect perfection. i second guess the things i know how to do, things ive known how to do for years. i’m never sure of myself even when i know something is true. i can’t stand that about myself. 

this isn’t only with dancing, singing, and driving. it’s everything. i am at a complete loss. 

i don’t know where to start so i can gain confidence to conquer this very compact problem of mine.  

i cry over this so much it’s genuinely taken over my life. i want to have fun and do these things, i don’t feel forced, i don’t feel like it isn’t me, i just feel stuck and embarrassed to the point that i would rather die than have fun because im unsure of myself :(",1765511788.0,socialanxiety

Also if you are trying to control the situation so nothing bad is gonna happen, it will not work. Just like anything in life it never works until you do it correctly

The way exposure works is it is just like facing a phobia, an example from my life would be me facing my fear of making eye contact in public with exposure,

Here is what i did:

Before exposure:

Situation: walking in public while not avoiding eye contact and without distracting myself

What i think is gonna happen: people is gonna  laugh at me, people will look at me thinking am weird, strange and something like that
People will come at me and say i don't think you should be here and stzrt bullying me...etc

How likely do you think this is what gonna happen: 75 percent

What we want with exposure is to tolerate the risk, either whats on my mind doesn't happen. Or it happens and i realize i can tolerate the discomfort, i can handle more than i thought like being bullied or being seen as a total idiot.

Hope this was little helpful

Let me know guys if want me to make a series of posts explaining this in detail based on my personal experience and the people i've helped

Thank's

1pkcbuq,sleep pattern & anxiety (doing bad at the moment),"so basically, i'm doing quite bad at the moment, I feel very jittery throughout the day & get irritated easily, I feel my mind isn't at peace at all & every day is a challenge. My legs feel like they have a lot of nervous energy in them. 

I go to sleep really late, around 4am on average, I get up around 11am so i'm still technically getting 6/7 hours which is nearly the recommended amount

now my question is, is going to bed at this time giving me these problems? or is that not possible as i'm still getting nearly the correct amount of hours 

i'm in quite a low mindset at the minute with it all, & could do with some advice or help 

i've been doctors but all they seem to do is just try & get me on meds, which I don't want to do

1pkbupj,Am I the only one I'm really bothered about this it's a piece of my journal,"Poeple are trange or dull. Every day feels like the last: the same people, the same jokes, and nobody even notices. I feel lonely even though I’m not alone. I repeat the actions I’ve done before, and people react to them like it’s the first time.
I tell lies, but everyone insists I’m telling the truth — they argue with me when I say I’m lying. I feel like an observer: I look at everyone, but no one looks at me. I analyze people’s movements and emotions, and I know what they’re going to do — they’re too predictable.
No one notices me, even though everyone pays attention to me. I watch everything and everyone, yet I don’t say a word. I know what people do and what they talk about, even though it’s hard. I often know the answers to questions but don’t say them.
I live in another world. I constantly think, change my strategy and plans. I change my behavior and personality for every person — and it works.

The isolation, the anxiety, the adhd like restlessness, the depression everything intensified so stepping into university after a year of complete silence felt impossible and then the insecurities kicked in. i’m older than most people in my batch two years older and i don’t fit the typical “vibe” of the girls around me like every time i don’t understand something or score a few marks less than them, i feel completely stupid. i know i’m not the only older one but my mind keeps telling me i’m behind in everything socially, academically, emotionally and when literally no one initiates a conversation with you… it starts eating you alive. i keep wondering if i look unapproachable, if i seem weird, if i’m doing something wrong. these last three months, there hasn’t been a single day i’ve come home without crying. it’s made me question whether i even have a purpose anymore feels like everyone around me is moving ahead while i’m stuck, older and still lost.",1765481064.0,socialanxiety
1pk60pn,It turns out my classmates really do speak badly about me,"Im a highschooler, out sick today. I wasn't even meant to see the email. It was just a coincidence that I had access to my mom's email account because she lent me her old phone and I use it now. I saw a notification from school and thinking it was directed to me I clicked on it. No, it was to my mother.

The email is about about one of my teacher's  concerns regarding my body odor. She's picked up on it, students picked up on it, and recently they're beginning to make comments about me that she's not sure if I'm aware that they're directed at me. She wouldnt want to embarrass me by saying something during class, she says, so thats how it reached my mother. But I still saw it.

I feel devastated. I knew I wasnt on people's best sides but i didnt know it was this bad. I didnt know I smelled that bad. I feel pathetic and gross and  it's no wonder or surprise that people barely approach me. I told one of my friends and she mentioned how she noticed my odor but didn't think anyone else would, since from most distances I'm fine. I'm bearable, at a distance. Not like the other classmates got close to me at all.

They must be justified to talk about me because even my mother and sister warned me that i should take better care of my hygiene or else this very thing would happen. And I tried: I take showers, I bring deodorant to school, use scented lotion. I just wasn't doing it to an adequate amount, and now my mother is justified in her social concerns, she's lectured me on this. Students will talk harsh about me if i dont take care of myself. I did take care of myself, but I didnt do it well enough and now it looks like to my mom that I never tried. In the end, I'm the gross and unhygenic one.

Im not mad at the teacher, I'm mad at myself. Now I'll find it hard to go to school, knowing how others perceive me: crappy enough to the point a teacher has to reach home.

1pk2y0g,How can you work on becoming a less anxious person?,"I’m curious about your opinions. I recently took a language exam, and while I was watching the people around me, I realized how much someone’s general well-being (and basically everything) is influenced by how nervous, overthinking, anxious, or, on the other hand, how calm they are. Unfortunately, I belong to the first group, but I’ve always been really interested in how I could improve myself, especially in this area.

The usual calming thoughts don’t really work for me, even though I know there’s nothing at stake, nothing changes whether I pass or fail, and that the examiners are just people too, they (hopefully) won’t intentionally hurt me, etc. I’ve read so many of these typical “don’t worry” ideas that I don’t think you could tell me anything new, but sadly, none of it has really helped me move forward. I still shake, I can barely speak, and it makes both the exam and the night before extremely difficult. Even while I’m talking, I don’t calm down; I often freeze up and can’t think, and my heart rate goes through the roof, which makes me even more afraid. The only somewhat comforting thought is that my problems don’t start there, but still, when I’m actually in the situation, I can’t detach myself from it.

I really envy those people who take exams completely calm, with minimal anxiety, as if they were just chatting with a friend. My biggest wish is to improve at least a little, but sometimes I feel like it might be physically impossible. Are people simply “born this way,” making the whole thing hopeless?

1pk191o,Am I introverted or is it deeper than that?,"When I was younger I was extroverted, hugging and talking to strangers when I was little, but as I grew up, I started to become more reserved and quiet to where I became labeled as introverted. 

I don't really know when the change happened, I just think of the times my mother used to say I was extroverted, but I changed... I don't even remember half my childhood! 

Anyway, as I've gotten older I've come across some problems that I find wrong and not just ""introverted"", and I often ask myself ""why do I act like this?""

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**The biggest problems I have are** 

**1** I hate making eye contact with people, I feel like if I look at them they will judge me, think I'm weird, or call me out if I look them in the eyes. My mother often told me to look people in the eyes or they will just assume you aren't paying attention. 

**2** I don't understand why I think about what other people think of me or if there laughing or making fun of me. I really don't. I don't even try to think like this, but it happens, to the point where my thoughts overwhelm me when I'm trying to make a critical decision.

 Like for example, if I'm overwhelmed and someone is asking me a yes or no question, when I want to say ""No"" I get overwhelmed and say ""yes"" I hate this because I feel like I'm a pushover.  

**3** Depending on what clothing I wear, I feel exposed. For example I like wearing baggy clothes. If I wear a regular shirt I constantly think ""Something is wrong with the shirt"" or ""There's a stain on it"" or ""he/she is looking at me is there something wrong with it?'

**4** I'm more nervous when I'm in a new environment and more reluctant to do something that I've never done before, like go to a new restaurant, but if I'm somewhere that I've been too repetitively, at first I'm uncomfortable anxious, but then I get over the anxiety over time. Whenever there's a pause when someone is talking, or if I'm waiting for something in a public space I either just look at my nails, or look down. 

**5** the weirdest problem when I'm either in or just leaving a social situation, my heart is beating so fast, and I feel this weird almost pain like feeling in my chest... I have no idea why but it happens.

I won't go into the details but a lot of people who volunteer/are in the committee are good friends or know each other and have been doing it for a long time. It's mostly young people (18-25ish).

I've only ever attended one ""volunteer session"" with these people before so I hardly know anyone, but I will have another longer volunteer session early next year where I will possibly be around a few of these people multiple days. AKA it's worth meeting more of them beforehand.

This event is a ticketed Christmas drinks type thing at a bar. I will literally know no one there. There was a girl I knew but she can't go now.

If you read my last post you will see that I don't have many friends. Hence why I signed up to volunteer. And I think tonight could potentially be a fun night if I go. Except almost every little thought I have is telling me not to go; everyone there are already good friends they will not want a rando there, you will embarrass yourself, you will have nobody to talk to, you will be awkward and uncomfortable ETC.

So here I am again on reddit asking for advice. What do I do if I go and everyone is happily in groups and I am just on the outs? Right now all I feel like doing is bailing and not going.

This year I made christmas bags for (almost) everyone in my dorm. There was some hot chocolate, candy canes, other miscellaneous treats. I was able to hand them all out tonight, and it was really fun! 

The good parts: 

One guy gave me a hug and said he was grateful, another group invited me into their dorm and we played videogames and talked about naruto for a while. Another guy exchanged numbers with me and we're gonna go play pickleball when it gets warmer! It was nice to see everybody so happy, I feel like I was able to make some real connections. I enjoyed putting all the bags together, meeting some really cool dogs, and seeing everyone's christmas decorations.

The not as good parts:

Some people seemed really creeped out by me?

Can't easily talk about it to a potential friend or date because what if they decide it's a red flag? Or look down on you? No one in my family acknowledges it either. When I touch the subject with my parents, they feel guilty and I feel bad. It's like wherever I go, there's this huge elephant in the room that we're all looking at and willfully ignoring.

Interact with any normal person and they'll usually have tales and experiences to share about their teens and 20s, and I have to be reminded of the huge decade-long blank in the timeline of my life, but not talk about it because it would ruin the vibe. I feel pressure to act like I'm normal, when I'm anything but. This disorder is my skin and bones, I was formed by it, and when I can't be open about it I feel like I'm in hiding, like people don't actually know me. It's just so lonely.

1pjice4,I’ve finally started to feel like me again,"I consider myself a somewhat social person, but I don’t really hang out with people as much as I used to. I got out of an extremely toxic relationship just shy of two years ago and it affected me a lot more than I let on. He was controlling, manipulative and shattered my self-confidence. It got to the point where I just stopped doing anything because whatever I did he would get mad at, and whatever I didn’t do he would get mad about that. I lost good friends because of him. I managed to recover and reconcile some of those relationships, but I was never able to cross the hurdle of meeting people in person again. I was suddenly consumed by this fear that something terrible would happen to me, that they’d somehow someway hurt me too. 

Naturally, I went to therapy to help myself get out of this box I stuffed myself in. I won’t say I’m 100% good, but lately I’ve had a couple of victories. After class, I’ll hang out with a friend at the library or get something to eat with them between classes. I also made it a point to keep in touch with people even if they live far away, so if the moment were to ever arise then we could meet up. I also joined a discord gaming server where everyone is pretty chill. I’ve made a ton of great friends there who welcomed me immediately and talk to every day. We play games together, have conversations about literally anything and sometimes do movie nights! 

I’m so happy to say that I’m starting to feel like my old self again. I feel so loved where I am and that I don’t feel as afraid anymore to just walk up to someone and make conversation.

1pjefhl,Anyone Else Here Pretty Socially Perceptive?,"I was thinking about something today.

I was watching these videos of psychopaths, diagnosed psychopaths, talking. And then I read the comment section. And a lot of people really bought into it.

And I do get why. One person in particular talked in a very jovial tone. Almost jokey a lot of the time. He comes across as likeable. Of course, if you know your psychology, you know that psychopaths in reality are rarely the ""cold husks"" that TV likes to show. Rather a core part of the diagnosis is superficial charm and glibness.

So his tone was one thing. But everything else was manipulative. He would constantly subtly reframe the topic. Like when asked about ""trust"" he would reframe it first as being about ""reliability."" Which allowed him to talk about himself positively. He would always do that too, start off very positive. Then sprinkle in some ""negatives"" while at the same time downplaying them. Talking about things as ""I never intended harm"" and ""it was just ribbing"" or ""I'm just a thrill seeker."" Or saying things like ""others say this"" to make it seem subjective, or subtly shifting the blame. He also constantly avoided discussing ANY details about his behaviour, always speaking in vagueries like me and my brother went ""thrill seeking"" and often omitting key details.

I noticed all of this very easily, and yet based on the comment section this guy had a lot of people convinced he really was a decent guy.

I also remember this time when, in high school, there was this new girl in class. I don't remember exactly what I noticed, but I remember noticing the first day she was there that she seemed untrustworthy. I think part of it is that I felt an underlying... coldness in her, regardless of what she was actually saying.

My then best friend decided to date her and found out, unfortunately, that she was not a great person. I still regret not telling him about my suspicions. But, I felt they were based on so little. And I didn't want to sabotage what might've been a good thing.

Or another friend of mine. He met a girl. And within, idk, 10 minutes of talking to her I immediately noticed a bunch of red flags. But, again, I didn't want to get in between and sabotage something potentially good. And, once again, things turned out similarly.

And there have been a bunch of times where... When I feel my anxiety spike in certain ""high stakes"" social situations, I often don't trust myself. And in the past I have often contacted my psychologist to ask her advice on what I should do. But what I noticed is that a lot of the time I am better at predicting the person's reaction than she is. Obviously I'm closer to the situation, so that definitely helps. But the point is... I tend not to trust my own judgement when it comes to social situations. Like... at all. But objectively speaking I seem to be pretty good at it.

I can't shake the uncertainty though. I never trust what I think, or say, or think of doing. I'm always scared it'll be wrong.",1765400486.0,socialanxiety

I drain energy without gaining genuine connection in that setting so it’s a disservice to others as well .. I’ll be forgetful of what we talk about, and that’s not the kind of friend I want to be… I put forward simply how I participate in the world, regardless of my alphabet soup!

I usually don't attend to any parties. My hands begin to shake, my pulse accelerates,  I start to sweat, my stomach feels like is closing and I have trouble breathing. Just by thinking about it wahile writting this makes me feel sick.

I'm 17, and a senior. To celebrate our last incoming year of school our grade decided to do a party, a girl decided to do it on her family's country house (I think it's called like that, english is not my first language so feel free to correct me)

I usually never attend parties, so I said to my friends that I wasn't going, I thought they were used to my behavior until they started to get a bit aggressive, telling me that I would regret it, and that they didn't hate me or anything so they didn't understand why iI didn't wat to go since it would be a nice memory (One of the reasons why I didn't want to go is because I struggle to make friends with my classmates, or even talk to them/make eye contact)

  
I was ok with missing on that party since I don't like parties and know that if I were to go to the party I would end up leaving really early. Sometimes alcohol helps me not feeling that bad (I've been using it for a few years now. I DON'T reccomend under-age drinking, it just helps me and I don't know any other way around) but I don't know if it'll help me this much.

1pj589k,Confidence shattered after job loss + 5 months unemployment. How do I fix my interview anxiety?,"Hey everyone,  
I really need some guidance because I feel stuck in a loop I can’t break out of.

Earlier, I used to be extremely confident in interviews. I could talk smoothly, think clearly, and perform well under pressure. I was so relaxed about results that even if I didn’t get shortlisted, it didn’t bother me — and ironically, that chill attitude helped me perform even better.

But things changed.

I was asked to resign from my previous company, and then I stayed unemployed for 5 months. That break hit my confidence hard. Even though I later cracked a good off-campus job as an ASE in an MNC — coming from a tier-3 college where even toppers struggled — I still feel like something inside me didn’t fully recover.

Now I’m desperate for a job again, and that desperation has made my anxiety worse.  
When a telephonic round starts, I freeze. My breathing gets heavy, I overthink every sentence, and I blank out. It’s not even fear of failure — it’s the pressure of “I NEED this job.” Earlier when I didn't care about the result, I performed at my best. Now the more I care, the worse I perform.

Honestly, I couldn’t even put all of this into words properly — ChatGPT helped me structure my thoughts so I could express what I’m actually feeling.

Has anyone gone through something similar?

Last year I was prescribed Lexapro, which basically eliminated all my anxiety. It was incredible. However, my memory became terrible, I had very bad brain fog all the time, and I had no more motivation or ambition.

So, I decided to stop taking \~3 months ago as it was affecting my performance in college. I was fine at first, and the brain fog cleared up a little bit, but recently my anxiety has been flaring up A LOT. 

Now, I become physically very panicked around certain people. I now have to hype myself up to do something very simple (like walking into a classroom) when I didn't even need to think about it before. Once my Wellbutrin runs out (I take it twice a day), my body just enters flight mode and then my mind follows it even if I'm completely alone. I ruminate over past events constantly, to the point where studying is nearly impossible at times. 

So I'm in a bit of a dilemma. I can't go back to the Lexapro, as it destroyed my memory and ability to focus/be present (which I still am recovering from). I'm also a pilot, and I'm not legally allowed to fly while taking two antidepressants at once.

1piu3dh,Does it ever go away?,"I have pushed myself out of my comfort zone so many times that pretty much everyone who has met me thinks I'm not afraid of anything. People think I'm confident because I can dance at clubs alone, attend large concerts alone, eat at restaurants alone, etc.

Little do they know that the reason I can overcome anxiety to do those ""big"" things is because I get anxiety about...everything. For me, the anxiety I get from getting gas is equivalent to going to a concert alone. I get anxious going to the grocery store, walking down the sidewalk, etc. Pretty much anything outside my bedroom is outside my comfort zone.

People have told me for years that continuing to get outside my comfort zone will help me, but so far that has not worked. I get more comfortable in certain situations insofar as I get familiar with the specific location and my route there, but if it's, say, going through a drive thru line in a new city, then it's back to square one. I want to be confident doing things in places I haven't been to, not just be confident in my bubble; even better would be to do new things in places I haven't been to.

And embarrassing myself and ""realizing it's not that bad to embarrass yourself"" has not helped either. I have some SERIOUSLY embarrassing moments, especially from when I was younger. Ive crashed an e bike into a pole going 30 mph in front of 50 people. I went to a high school party with people I barely knew and really admired, drank too much, and had a meltdown so bad they called CPS (can't make that shit up). I once accidentally texted my crush, who did not like me back, a screenshot from my diary talking about their best qualities, which I'd meant to send to my friend. A guy once stole my phone, opened my gallery, found a video of me dancing in my underwear, and showed his friends. Once while walking down the sidewalk amongst a bunch of guys, I stepped over a vent and my dress flew straight up into my face.

I also have the socially awkward experiences, which sucked, like eating alone in the cafeteria. I am grateful I'll never have to return to that again. But none of that has really helped me. It all still feels exactly the same. The one thing that does help is if I'm looking my best - have my hair done, wearing nice clothes, groomed, etc., but I don't want to feel like I can only go outside and do things if I've spent half an hour beautifying myself.

It took me awhile but I started following them on IG and they all followed me back except for one of them. One mom who is younger and has a funny personality but also an aggressive personality and she is very social. When we have nights out I do notice she gets sloppy drunk and talks a of sh about people. But they are annoying people she talks about and not other moms it’s the leadership in our group and they are overbearing. She does take it far. Anyways my venting is about she never followed me back on IG and I have left a couple of comments on her stories and they get left on seen. She never likes them or responds. So I unfollowed her. I am wondering if I see her next time I should ask her if she knows who I am. Of course she does I just don’t think she likes me. Anyone want to share any thoughts.

I tend to have a hard time not ruminating, overthinking, or overall feeling guilt & discomfort after social situations. This often comes from driving, coming back from school, going to the store, literally anywhere. 
It is worse when I had a bad moment or personally embarrassing moment. 
My rumination gets so bad it often affects my day off the bat and it is difficult to even recover.

I feel like what is worse is that I have a continuous pit in my chest from anxiety, uneasiness and dread. 

I have done breathing exercises, thoughts on trial cbd worksheets, and try and talk about my emotions with others. It still doesn’t work. 

What works for you guys? I feel stuck. Sometimes if it all snowballs my paranoia about others increases. Thanks.",1765332146.0,socialanxiety
1pip095,Ghosting silence,"
I am writing to share an observation about business networking that has been causing me some concern and anxiety as a business owner.

I have been in business and sales for 20 years. Over the past two years, I have noticed a marked shift in professional communication and engagement, especially regarding networking. Individuals, including those I have done business with for years, are suddenly becoming extremely difficult to reach, often disappearing or not responding to communications.

It appears that many people, particularly employees within larger corporations, are doing the bare minimum and are reluctant to develop or expand relationships. Getting any response from established contacts now feels like fighting tooth and nail, which is a new and consistent pattern I've noticed with dozens of people, not just an odd few.

This trend is creating significant anxiety for me as a business owner. I would appreciate any insight or advice you might have on how to overcome this challenge and adapt my networking strategies to the current environment. I feel like it stifling growth and positivity. It’s almost like an attitude of” I don’t give a F anymore”. 

I’ve had some friends over the last few years act in a similar way. So if a common trend across different parts of life.

Thank you for your time and perspective.

I recently had a convo with one of my coworkers and they asked what I did before this and I started panicking and lied and said I was self employed when in reality I wasn’t doing anything with my life before this.. my life was still being funded by my parents at an age where people should be financially independent, and I was just rotting away in my room… I know I should be grateful to have a job and be doing really well, but I can’t help but feel ashamed of my past. It prevents me from getting too close with coworkers and people in general and I spiral at the thought of having to explain to my partner one day about the darkest period of my life. I hate lying, but I also don’t want people to judge me if I tell the truth. Has anyone been in a similar position?

1pilz0x,New hire at my work inadvertently helped me with my social anxiety,"So today at work there was a new hire, who was working next to me and she would often ask me questions because she needed help figuring out some work related stuff. I realize me being in a position of teaching someone else gave me confidence I didn’t know I had, and the more she approached me to ask a new question, the more I became less socially anxious. She doesn’t know this but she helped me so much and it carried over throughout the rest of my day- I was in such a good mood I was talking more than usual and had more confidence when speaking to others. 

I’m beginning to think maybe I should pursue a hobby or something where I am in a position of teaching and explaining things to others because I really like that feeling of helping others, it definitely got me talking and focus on trying to explain what I was saying the best that I can. I wanna start small like helping people one on one, maybe become a tutor since I am excellent with school related subjects. I really don’t know. ",1765320812.0,socialanxiety
1pijsj7,"Do I want friends, or do I just want them because everyone tells me I should?","I've recently been wondering if I really want friends. I only have one friend, and I barely see him, but it doesn't bother me that much. If I think about it, not having friends wasn't even a problem for me until high school when my parents and teachers started insisting I should have friends. I never cared, but from then on, they really started pushing it, and they still do. It wasn't such a big deal for me until they made me realize I was doing something wrong. 

I don't know, I often think that half of my concern about never socializing is because I feel pressured to, not because I'm actually interested or excited about it. Whenever I think about putting myself in situations where I have to make friends, I feel terrible. I don't want to, and I'm not interested in the slightest, but I still feel pressured, like if I don't, I'm living my life the wrong way? 

And it makes me think that's probably why all my social interactions go badly. Because I go around with the predisposition to be liked and make friends when in reality I'm not even interested. That's why I put in so much effort and get so nervous, and when I see things go wrong I get disappointed even though I have no interest in getting anything out of it. 

I'm at home and I feel bad for not being out there making friends and ""living life,"" but then when I do, I have a bad time and I just want to be at home. I think I'm simply chasing social achievements that I couldn't care less about and that only cause me problems. It's true that I want to improve socially in other areas, like walking down the street without overthinking or being able to be in a public place without anxiety. But otherwise, I'm not interested and I'm just suffering for no reason.

On Friday I went to a house party at my friend’s friend’s place. There were probably around 15 people there and I didn’t know a single one of them. I was completely sober too, not by choice really, I was super bloated and couldn’t face drinking 😭 It took a while for my friend to convince me to go, but eventually I said yeah okay and pushed myself to do it.

At first I expected to completely shut down because my social anxiety is really bad. Like, I normally cry when I have to meet new people. But somehow… I just did it? I talked to people. A lot of people. Probably around 10 different people over the time I was there. Everyone was so nice to me, conversations just kind of happened, and I laughed way more than I thought I would.

I stayed for about two to two and a half hours and went home around half ten feeling honestly proud instead of drained or embarrassed, which is new for me.

What really got me though is that a few people there actually said they really wanted to see me again, and a group of them have invited me out to karaoke this Thursday. That has never happened to me before, ever.

It pushed me so far out of my comfort zone, but in a good way, and I just wanted to share because this feels like a massive step for me. If you struggle with social anxiety too, I promise the small wins matter. I’m really proud of myself for this one 🥺💗",1765306693.0,socialanxiety

More often than not, social anxiety is dismissed as simply being introverted, when in reality you can be extroverted *and* socially anxious at the same time.

It’s only when you become an adult and start thinking about your career and future that reality hits. The mild “loneliness"" you felt from having no friends or being left out in school suddenly turns into a very real threat to your life. It can affect everything from your job to relationships, and your overall experience of living.

You don’t just fail at small things. The accumulated setbacks, frustrations, and missed opportunities gradually snowballs until eventually it feels like you’re failing at life, which can further lead to other mental health issues like depression.

Yet social anxiety is still poorly understood compared to other mental disorders. People assume you can simply “snap out of it” or “just talk to people and make friends"" and they often treat you as if you are a creep or some lesser being when you show symptoms of social anxiety.",1765290415.0,socialanxiety

I have worked at 1 other fast food place in the past (for almost 6 months) and now I am working at Tim Hortons, which has been fine but extremely stressful for me. I want to first explain the context of my social anxiety. first off, like almost anyone else, i want friends and seek social relationships.

The main reason I’m writing this is because after 3 weeks of working in fast food again, I am really really struggling with my anxiety and when I wake up i cry every single day and when I get home I cry some more. Mostly as a way to release all the built up emotions after being treated like crap at work by mainly customers, but also sometimes coworkers for not being fast or good enough.

I might be being dramatic but this industry kills my soul and I really need something better where I don’t have to talk or socialize all the time. It’s exhausting.

 my anxiety makes me really closed off and i don't really talk much about myself in general. my coworkers are really nice and have made efforts to get to know me before but my social skills suck so the conversation never makes it that far. it's even become a bit of a joke. i once told to my manager that i really like classic rock, and when she mentioned it again in a conversation with some other coworkers a couple days later they were all super surprised that she managed to find out something about me. they were all super shocked, they kept asking her how she managed to find that out about me. i've worked there for over 2 years. something like that should be basic knowledge by now but i'm so reserved that it was like they uncovered some deep, dark secret or something.

 i'll probably end up getting a generic gift like a candle or a gift card. which is fine, and i'm greatful regardless, but it would've been nice if i could've gotten a present actually based on who i am and what i enjoy doing. i have no one else to blame for it but myself though :/",1765269166.0,socialanxiety
1pi29jb,this situation is getting stressful,"Is there anyone who feels constantly awkward in social interactions like me? Whether it's a friend, a relative, a colleague, or a stranger, I can never be completely calm and relaxed when speaking and expressing myself.

I can't just talk. I can't act silly for the sake of it. I can't tell a funny story. I can't talk to someone for long without slurring my words, losing my train of thought, forgetting things, and panicking. I feel weird.

The only time I can speak in a steady, natural flow is when I'm at the therapist's, probably because I'm in a safe environment where I don't fear judgment.

Every other time, however, it's torture. My movements become mechanical and wooden, my thoughts become confused, my brain starts analyzing everything.

This makes me feel terrible, because I feel like I can't truly connect with other human beings. It pains me to see two people happily conversing and having a good time together... it makes me feel wrong. I'm not saying I never have pleasant moments with my friends or that I never have fun, but this constant feeling of unease lives inside me.

I can't figure out how to fix this or if I should just accept it. I can't figure out if it's related to my mood or how I've trained my brain to experience social interactions. I don't know, guys. This isn't the first post I've made on Reddit about this problem. I just want to feel free to just be, without a little voice in my head telling me ""you're doing well"" or ""you're doing badly.""

1phxuls,"I have everything, I just don't know how to communicate","Good evening, this is a real rant, and I know it may seem like a minor problem to some, but for me it's getting more complicated every day.

I'm very happy with my life currently, I passed medicine at a competitive college in Brazil, I'm studying, I got a body that I fought for years to have, I'm taking care of my appearance, I made more friends, I learned new hobbies, I started living alone, I get dates, I've been seeking God... I'm very happy with the direction of my life. It's not much, but it's honest work.

However, a problem that has haunted me for some time constantly comes back to affect me and manages to distract me from all the advances in my life: communication.

I hate how I express myself. I feel like I sound too desperate in my words, I scream when I want to talk, I talk when I want to scream. I stumble a lot when speaking. There are times when I talk too much, seem desperate for attention and can't adapt to the tone of the moment. Other times, I feel too out of place and I also seem desperate, agreeing with everything and laughing for nothing. My voice is very semitone, I express myself in a very expansive way. And it seems like I can't control it.

I simply can't be too serious, I have to make a joke or do some self-deprecation. Public speaking? Fuck, I'm going to shake like a green stick.

Even in my own friendships and relationships, I feel that this difficulty in expressing myself - or simply having control over it - affects our bond. I've even heard from other people, indirectly, that I'm forced, fit in and weird.

I feel terrible about this.
Despite all the advances, this part of mine seems to be going backwards. Modestly, it's HORRIBLE to be the size I am (I'm about 90kgs) and communicate looking like a capuchin monkey.
Or I'm always the clown, remembered, but little taken seriously. Or I'm the guy who's just there, agreeing, and I don't make any difference.
I've never dated and I can't see myself dating.

I'm already a psychologist, who helped me accept myself better and dealt with a lot of insecurities.
And currently, I DON'T RUN AWAY FROM ANY FIGHT. I always go out of my way to present something I worked on, have the simplest small talk and go on a party with new people, even if I get home extremely distressed and with a feeling of failure.
But it simply doesn't get better.

If anyone is going through something similar or knows the best thing to do, I would be very grateful for the help or dialogue we can have. 👊",1765252905.0,socialanxiety
1phws1i,Life has been kicking my ass lately,"Life has been really hard lately. I feel like I'm falling behind even tho I'm only 19. My social anxiety got worse after the summer and I've been on a wait list to get therapy for a while and idk when I'm gonna get it. I was proud of myself for at least realizing I need help and reaching out for it but I'm so desperate and they won't call me, it's frustrating.

 Last year I fucked up college really bad. This year is even worse. I'm passing half of my subject Wich is good but I feel so bad for being weak and not able to do all of them. I have so many presentations and the truth is I can't handle them. I did one two weeks ago, it went super super badly but it's done. But now I can't do the rest of them. I stress to an insane level when it comes to presentations and sometimes I think a grade isn't worth me getting this emotionally damaged over it. So I'm choosing peace and avoiding some of them that are too much for me. I can barely do prepared presentations and I have one where it's improvised and we have to have a discussion and answer questions and my brain doesn't work under pressure so that's definitely too much for me. A lot of people will say that just makes it worse and avoiding it is awful but I'm doing the best I can to survive. I also feel so bad for not going, last year I did the same thing and it was awful but I do think this year it's better because I am passing some classes. I wish I was stronger. I feel like I'm trying my best while at the same time being super lazy. I hate tht I struggle so much with such a simple little task like this but if just sitting in class gives me unhealthy amounts of stress I hate having to push myself to do the presentations. It doesn't help my anxiety it just makes it worse. And they're mandatory. 
I wish my brain was a bit more normal. I'm also grieving so maybe that made the anxiety worse now idk. All I know is thy this is too much to handle. I don't even know if I'm in the right degree. All this anxiety and I'm not even doing why I love. Also a reason of why maybe im not pushing myself to the limit, maybe if it was something else I'd be able to do it.

1phvr1e,"I want to talk and interact but I also really, really don't. F16","I am in high school, and my middle social anxiety and extremely low self esteem have returned :( I just broke it off with a counselor who basically told me it was my fault I was having a hard time socializing, and I'm trying not to internalize it, but it's hard. I also just started a low dose of Guanfacine for this.

I barely have any close friends anymore. I feel as though I'm retreating into a shell, pushing everyone away, but I don't want to. I just feel like my very prescence is putting a bubble around me. I want to talk to people like a normal person, have friends and smile, but at the same time I don't.

It's so much easier to be alone. I don't have to talk. I don't have to smile and try to use slang I don't understand. But it's so lonely and I don't want to hurt the very few I'm close to. I don't want to be thought of as weird, but I feel like whether I talk to people or talk to no one, I'll be seen as weird because that's just who I am.

I don't even know if this makes sense. It's this big cognitive dissonance.

Basically, I want to find ways to interact with others without being so afraid everyone's going to hate me. My past therapist said the only way was to just do it, but is that true? I feel too jittery to 'just do it,' and every time I throw myself in, I hate myself afterwards.

1phv37s,Do I leave this note when I leave,"I currently work at a salon and if you want context to the situation I have another post on my account about it but TLDR while talking to the owner of the salon she made a very rude comment of the way that I looked. The way that I look has to do with I have horrible anxiety and I’m nearsided and did not have my glasses on as they make my ears hurt 

I’ve been considering heavily leaving this salon and moving in with my life and going into a career in radiology and working at the hospital about an hour away from the salon. If all goes well with my interview Thursday I think I’m going to move forward with that 

My question is should I leave a note or text message explaining why I’m leaving after I leave I’m probably going to block her and the other stylist to. I could just leave it be and leave in peace but I also want to tell her that what she said was hurtful and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it or be able to talked to her without freaking out. 

This is a draft of what I want to say 

(Some text about the original convo we had) What I don’t understand is why you said what you said about the way i look. That’s just how my face is, I was focused on what you were saying and not on how i looked. I never once thought you, or (other stylist), or any of your clients were stupid or intentionally look at them in a way that made them feel like I was. Constructive criticism is one thing, making uncalled for remarks about the way I look is a completely different thing. Ever since you said that I can’t talk to you without thinking about that comment.

Tried to date several times, and all then failed. Faced work environment, get some really rough situations, but it didn't matter, because i was pursuimg my dream and earning money. Then my company laid me off. I'm trying hard now to find a job in my field, for almost 2 months.
In the meantime, i became a very bitter person. Because of the situation i find me now. My past ""me"" would be really scared and disgusted.

I've also realized that my brains sees everything as an equation/puzzle, and so when things happen outside of the way I imagined/planned for, it completely sends me into chaos.

I’ve never had a relationship, my friendships are distant, and even with family around, I feel like I can’t really connect. I’ve tried studying, working, and building skills, but reaching out to people feels impossible.

It’s like I watch everyone else forming bonds, sharing moments, and I just don’t have the tools to join in. I never learned how to talk to someone, comfort someone, or be present in a relationship. Most of my emotional life exists in books, games, and movies — in the real world, I feel shut off.

I’m hoping to hear from people who’ve felt similarly and learned to navigate it. How did you start connecting with others? How did you learn to trust, communicate, and feel like you belong?

1ph3t82,DEA have social anxiety but no one believes you,"I am someone who implodes instead of explodes. So when in feeling extreme social anxiety it usually is an internal shut down not and external melt down. And it also tends to manifest in a lot of intrusive thoughts that either prevent me from engaging in a social situation or send my flight response into overdrive. Because my symptoms are relatively easy to hide if no ones paying attention (shakiness, weakness, cold sweats, increased heartrate, difficulty breathing, scatter thoughts, ect) i dont think anyone who knows me would believe me if i told them. 

I do pretty well in group settings when theres clear common ground. Ill just let the others do the talking and add stuff when i need to but the farther outside of my comfort zone the worse the symptoms. I usually find a way to leave a situation before it gets bad. The most annoying thing is even when im not in a situation where i feel intense panic, with EVERY interaction i feel underlying anxiety and insecurity. Constantly having intrusive thoughts and over analyzing every interaction. The slightest perceived neutral/negative response has me second guessing my entire existence and self worth. Ill be laughing with a coworker and then if they dont laugh at the next thing i say im convinced they think im the most annoying person they know and hate having to work with me.

Even though logically I know most people don’t care. I skip changing a lot because I panic right before going in. Then my grade drops and I feel even worse about myself. I’m tired of this cycle. I’m tired of being scared of something that literally takes 15 seconds for everyone else.I’m especially scared of the popular group of friends in my class.

I want to be able to just walk in, change my pants, and leave like it’s nothing. But right now it feels impossible. I don’t want to keep skipping. But I’m honestly scared.

1ph0oov,Why i cant speak,"Idk if anyone is going to read all this but im just gonna list all the reasons why i barely speak at school or in other places especially in groups. Even in my own friend group (not that close to everyone in it, only close to like 2 people) also plz dont be mean. Im posting this to know if anyone else relates and for advice (again plz be respectful when giving advice) 

The reasons: 
Fear of embarrassing myself by saying the wrong thing or the person im talking to ends up being a jackass and then they show negative reactions such as silence or even a slightly judgmental/mean comment. And if its in a group it would be even more embarrassing 

Scared because im TERRIBLE with words and just simply trying to speak makes me forget what the fuck i was going to say. i don't want to awkwardly stutter and forget what i was going to say in front of someone. And also like i just CANT form my thoughts into words, im terrible at speaking for a long time. Lol like Even with essays, like i just cant put my thoughts into words so i just use chatgpt (ik its bad) everyone is typing so fast and i haven't even wrote my thesis yet

fear of my voice being too quiet and i keep repeating their name over and over to get their attention but they don't hear me, but then someone else NEXT to me heard me continuing to repeat their name and observed me and then it gets so fucking awkward and i awkwardly stop calling their name. I hate when people observe me when something awkward happens to me

my voice getting stuck because my throat is dehydrated and i always have to clear it and even when i clear it, it still cracks sometimes. Also i just CANT bring myself to speak cuz i just feel like my voice is completely gone and there's like a huge force thats stopping me from taking action and speaking

Fear of people not listening to me cause my voice is too quiet and so they give up trying to listen OR 
 they get distracted by something else in the middle of me speaking AND on top of that someone else observes this happening and then i feel so fucking awkward and stop talking (this is why i never speak in long sentences when im talking to someone in public)

Fear of finally starting to talk after a long time of not really talking in the group so its fucking awkward because like theyre not used to me talking so once i finally like speak up, they're weirded out. They might even show a weird reaction like silence or say stupid shit like ""no one asked you, you barely even talk in the group"" or another weird comment. 

Fear of sounding confrontational and angry when i slightly raise my voice, so i therefore don't talk at all cuz the only way i can talk, is talk quietly, but if i speak quietly they wont hear so therefore i don't speak at all. Like i just really can't find a middle ground in my voice volume...

Fear of other people observing me while im speaking to someone. They might judge my words, my body language, my awkward way of speaking

I cant keep a conversation going because im so anxious and focused on how i appear and again im terrible with words so nothing comes up in my head 

Everyone is constantly talking and i don't know how to join in the convo, i feel like i'll interrupt and it will feel awkward

1ph0bix,advice please,"im 16 years old and started a new school 2 months ago now. Ive spent the last 3 years of my life constantly skipping school each day and wandering around the city without talking to anyone or making friends and when I'd come home I'd stay in my room and never speak to anyone.

my parents applied me to schools over the 3 years and I got into a new one maybe a year into skipping but that didn't turn out well and I just started skipping again after the 2 week break leading to me losing all friends I had there and being socially outcasted.

the application to my current school wasn't being responded to after months so I decided to go in in person and ask what was going on leading to them reapplying me and a few weeks later getting in.

it's supposed to be a laid back adult learning experience similar to college where you can choose your own schedule and when you want and don't want to do work. usually students come in a few days a week for a few hours but I wanted to come in daily for the full 6 hours.

for the first couple weeks I couldn't bring myself to talk to anyone I met there, there was a large friend group in the school who all seemed really cool to me and one of them was especially approachable.

so one day I started talking to them and we had a lot of similar interests and the week later we spent like 4 hours hanging out after school and we got pretty close.

Then after that I was more willing to open up to the others of the group and I ended up getting close with another two people.

I was close enough with 3 of the 8 to stay at their houses when my own living situation was getting rocky and two of them visited me when I was put in the psych ward for a week.

I really like these guys and want to be friends with them so bad and they say they're my friends but I don't feel it.

whenever we talk I'm the one to message first, none of them have ever messaged me first.

whenever they tell me something they include they already told someone else first.

they all have friends other than me that they prioritize over me and I can't stop feeling sick to my stomach jealous over it.

everyone has someone else and I have nobody like that, it doesn't matter what they tell me when were together because I never feel it's true.

one of them told me about how they're only faking being optimistic because of how pessimistic I am, and they're not as happy a person they come off to be because they say they don't have any friends and they're glad I'm their friend.

then they go a week not showing up to school and when I message them they don't respond?

how can you say Im the only friend you've had in ages that you really care about and love but then not talk to me.

I see you're online I see you posting on your story I know you're talking to other people and I'm being ignored.

I spent 3 years alone and now that I have friends it's the worst time of my life because I cant be as important to them as they are to me.

I feel expendable and when I am with them I feel like I'm taking up time they could be spending with people they actually care about and I'm scared they'll leave me because I'm really just a shallow unsociable person and when I'm not putting on my loud flamboyant act I feel like they'll ditch me after realising I'm nobody special.

I deactivated my Instagram a few days ago to stop myself from messaging them then spending the day checking if they're online and airing me.

I want to talk to them about this but I dont want to sound like I'm guilt tripping them into talking to me more.

none of them have reached out on other platforms we have each other added on about my Instagram being gone so that makes me feel even better.

1pgw6h2,My thought,"Hi everybody.
Today, while spending some time with my nephew and his little friends, something really struck me. Watching them grow up in this fast-moving world of technology made me realise how much things have changed—especially for the generation we now call Gen Alpha and Gen Beta.

It feels like somewhere along the way, we’ve stopped letting our children truly open their minds. And I’m not blaming anyone—maybe as parents or future parents, we all want our kids to be safe, to never face what we once faced, to never feel the pain we felt. But I’ve also seen how this turns into overprotection.

A child cries, and everything is placed in front of them instantly. No waiting, no thinking, no learning. If we never let our children feel small struggles, how will they ever understand effort, patience, or even basic survival instincts?

Sometimes I think about how our grandparents lived.
They grew up farming, cultivating their own crops, raising cows and buffaloes—not as “pets” but as part of life and responsibility. Kids used to take cattle for grazing, help their parents in the fields, and learn through real experiences. They built relationships with neighbours and relatives because life naturally connected everyone.

But today, it feels different.
We are drifting into a world where we don’t even know who our neighbours are. Not their names, not their families, not their struggles. Technology was meant to change the world, but it has also started changing the human inside the world.

Maybe some people call this “freedom.” Maybe some feel it’s modern living.
But personally, I don’t know.
I just feel something important is slipping away—connection, community, resilience, and the simple understanding of life.

1pgs3a1,Why Do I Sound Less Smart When I Speak Than When I Think?,"I struggle to express myself and share my knowledge, and it frustrates me deeply.

I consider myself fairly smart and knowledgeable. I’ve always been curious, interested in many subjects, and capable of forming clear, coherent thoughts , at least when I’m alone or writing. When I write, I can express myself easily, articulate complex ideas, and feel confident about what I know.

But the moment I’m face-to-face with someone, especially in conversation, everythin changes. My words come out messy. I struggle to form sentences, doubt everything I say, sound hesitant and unsure ,even when I’m talking about topics I’m passionate about and have spent hours learning through reading, documentaries, and research.

It mostly happens with people I find interesting or knowledgeable ; people I actually want to connect with. The pressure builds in my head, my mind goes blank, and I end up saying “I don’t know” not because I truly don’t know, but because speaking suddenly feels too difficult. I withdraw into listening mode instead of sharing my perspective, which only increases my frustration.

With people who aren’t knowledgeable about the subject, I speak more freely. There’s less fear of “messing up” or being corrected, so I feel safer expressing my thoughts without overthinking every word.

I genuinely don’t mind saying “I don’t know” when I actually don’t know, I have no ego around that. What hurts is when I do know, but can’t express it, and others assume I lack competence or even belittle me for it.

I’m not sure what causes this : anxiety, self-doubt, memory issues, or something else, but I know it’s holding me back both socially and professionally. I want to be able to express myself clearly, showcase my knowledge, and convey my competence so I can pursue opportunities I’m truly capable of handling.

Has anyone experienced something similar, or found ways to overcome this? I’d really appreciate any insight or advice.",1765137862.0,socialanxiety
1pgrni4,"I don't know if I'm afraid of, people or myself at this point.","I’m 28 now, and all I can remember about my life is I’ve spent it hiding myself from people. All I can feel now is just pain, the kind of pain that I can’t describe. I can’t seem to find even one person to talk to about what I feel. In 28 years, I couldn’t do that. I made friends, but they couldn’t stick for longer. All I could find out is I’m nice and humorous, but for a very short period. When they get to know me, they’ll see how really broken I am from the inside. And the blame isn’t on them, because I couldn’t let it out, and when I get connected to a person I feel like pouring my heart out, but communication/talking has never been my forte. I’m insecure, scared to lose, and I can’t explain what I feel or what I’m going through even if I want to.

I really never had the chance to have that confidence or credibility in myself. My opinions and decisions never mattered, even when they were about my studies, career, or likings. I couldn’t even be friends with people I wanted to because I was restricted because of their caste or their social life, according to my father’s friends. I couldn’t choose what I wanted to do in studies because my father wanted to know what’s best for me from his friends who don’t have PG degrees.

This urge of mine to be a nice guy, to never speak against anything (I tried, just a little, it didn’t work, so I decided to do what I could, which is being a good boy). My father wanted the best for me, but the problem is he didn’t think I could decide that. I really don’t know if it’s emotional torture or too much caring. But this is the identity of myself that I carry now. I didn’t get to choose anything for myself. And it sticks with me.

I can’t choose or even know what clothes I should buy, I go for a haircut and I let that guy decide what haircut is good. There was a time, at least for a while, when I used to think I can do anything. But it wasn’t for a longer period. Now it feels like I’m good for nothing. Even if I or my opinions have value for someone or somewhere, I don’t believe that they do.
I thought of trying to make it better, I thought I can do this but I can't face people now. I can’t talk with people in-person or virtually. And now I can’t see the point in any of it.

1pgf9pz,23F | MY take on social anxiety 🪷,"Hello everyone !

Finding this and reading the first few post has really made me feel like I’m not the only one who is struggling and the fact that having social anxiety isn’t taken seriously from others who don’t have it.

I’m glad this exist because I don’t have to try to explain myself repeatedly to people and expect them to understand.

Social anxiety has affected most my life until now and although I’m improving little by little I have come this far to have steady and secure conversation about it as I know I’m not the only one who struggles with overthinking and I think it comes with social anxiety which is honestly frustrating because not only it affects on you but others that you have in your life.

I’ve had moments in my dark days that I felt like I’m going insane and that I’m being unheard as I am in relationship right now and healthy one too and if I’m being honest we all know being in relationship can be hard because of what we have but what I am grateful about is that I was able to push myself to talk to people and that was on a app that looks like a  live stream or public VC for people you can meet online.

Of course I was scared as I often just stay in the comments section but when I met the right person to talk to and this was all from quarantine! So even tho I felt shaky this person didn’t even take notice and just treated me like everyone else.

My point is even though social anxiety can be isolating and prevent from doing this you deserve and to accomplish things doesn’t mean it’s impossible. A simple “ Hi “ and  Smile can go a long way but even though it didn’t go to plan you achieve something even though it’s small. 💗

It’s basically something like the example I have given and internal dialogue of “I hope I am perceiving myself okay” or if some stranger gives me a weird look or an expression that makes me feel I am doing something wrong, I would keep myself small and don’t do it again.

Okay, so I have a decent friend group online that I play games with frequently. I don’t talk to many people IRL to be honest, I’m too anxious and insecure. So playing games and talking with people is really the majority of my socialization because I can control my image, I can calculate what I’m saying before I say it.

I know, realistically, this probably isn’t the case. But I can’t stop myself from spiraling.

The past 5 years of my life sucked, from sister being in hospital 3 times for suicidal related issues (2 instances of thoughts, 1 instance of a attempt)
2 instances of a family member lying about bad things
And myself having multiple instances of suicidal thoughts and a attempt

It all started 4 years ago, (Chapter 1)

I was never a normal kid, hung out with the “weirdo” and was considered the “weirdo” where I just wanted more friends, was at a horrible mental spot, one day a few kids tricked me into saying racist things (back then I didn’t know what racist even ment)
I was socially isolated for the day and years after. Even today some people still remind me of it, then in 6th grade I got bullied by what felt like everyone, getting into a fight when I was considered still the “weird” kid but also the quiet kid. You all remember (or still do maybe) being in gym and running around and getting picked, not me- did 1 gym class and asked to be transferred to a different class, got called sped (even if it is a sped class) school did nothing about it, then one of my elementary school friends moved that year, and the other stopped being my friend. I just wanted to cry every single day, I eventually got onto a anti depressant that year, never got upset or mad for almost half a year, then hit the end of 7th grade


Chapter 2: The ending chapter
Warning: this chapter is a lot more intense

April 2025, my entire life falls apart, sister tries to commit suicide my med overdose, my only ever pet dies, 
Bullying gets worse, I got a small group at the beginning of 7th grade, but bullying gets worse, my depression gets worse, I start doing whatever I can to isolate myself- and slowly pull away from life
As summer hits the only fun thing. Was summer camp where it was awkward but 
I managed, then 8th grade hit, had 2 big sets of suicidal thoughts I kept secret. Then I tried killing myself twice in the worse ways possible, then I finally asked to get off my med, where after a few longs weeks and almost 2 years I was off the med. now I’m stuck and don’t know how to live anymore, the med basically made me not able to be anything other then happy.

You then discussed and researched about this new drug, and felt very positive that it would fix your anxiety. After taking it, you immediately ""believe"" that your problem will be fixed and interact with others extremely well, not caring if you act awkwardly because you believe the drug is making you more confident when its just your brain. From what I know, social anxiety is mostly caused by thought patterns and the perception that previous social interactions went badly and the fear that future social events will also be bad, and it can be removed simply by not caring about being awkward and judged by others when in social situations.",1765077755.0,socialanxiety

I got beeped in the car park for stopping to wait for someone to pull out (so that I could take their spot). I nearly got walked into a few times. I talked to several shop assistants. I was wedged between people for hours. 

But amidst all the chaos, I felt so peaceful inside. My daughter was fairly annoyed at my walking pace because I just … slowed down and leaned into the calmness within me. 

I’ve been on Sertraline for 7 months now. I used to feel highly agitated in shopping centres- even during non peak times. I’d avoid speaking to shop assistants at all costs. If someone honked at me in the car park, I’d be in fight or flight mode from there on out. 

I am in therapy and we’ve done a lot of work on my self worth, respect, trust and love. So it’s not just the medication helping me heal… but I definitely feel like, rather than:

The social anxiety was always there, but my boss gives it so much to feed off of.

  
Regardless, I’m so frustrated with myself that I used to give hour long presentations in front of a crowd of 100 people and feel fine, and now stumble all over my words, get out of breath, and generally sound stupid when I have to give a short 10 minute presentation.

  
The constant rumination is going to ruin my weekend. All day I’ve just been reliving every detail and it gives me the exact same sensation as if I was doing it all over again. Shaking, nausea, and constricted feeling throat/chest. Breathing on manual.

1pg0wah,Acted like a complete weirdo,"
Alright so I’m a college student and I had a mutual falling out with this girl I was in a “situationship” with for about a month. She said I was being too clingy, and after reflecting on it for about two months, I’m pretty sure she was right. 

Anyways, we had a falling out and ended things over text. I sent a text that I thought was very respectful to her and she sent one back that was a little tearse but nothing crazy. We haven’t talked in about two months. 

I was pretty distrust over what happened at the time. I was carpooling home from a party the night this all happened (and I was drinking very heavily) with a female friend of mine named Kay. I asker her for her advice and said she would be willing to help me out with things. After I got home, I sent her a photo of the text I sent the gal and her response. The text didn’t say anything like personal related other that us ending the relationship. She responded to my text criticized the gal and her text, Kay called her “ridiculous and crazy”. I just thanked her for the help and didn’t text her again. Kay and the gal don’t really know each other but do share one mutual friend. 

So it’s been about two months and Kay had been acting a little weird toward me ever since then, and I just have to speculate it’s because she’s uncomfortable about the text I sent. I haven’t texted her since, and every time I see her it seems like she doesn’t really want to have a full conversation although we always say hi to each other. We both have been incredibly busy and stressed out so that might have something to do with it, but I don’t know…

I am speculating that Kay is completely weirded out by me. After reading this post, I realize this whole thing also sounds pretty damn clingy and weird lol. But I guess I just need advice. Should I stop talking to Kay completely?

1pfwphe,A Friend and anxiety,"
I also want to talk about my SAD.

I have severe Social Anxiety Disorder.
In the first semester, I made a friend. He didn’t have SAD, but he often had low confidence. Because of that, we matched well — we had similar interests, and I started feeling good around him. We used to talk and laugh, but I still felt anxious sometimes, even with him.

This cycle continued over time.
Now we are in the 4th semester, and he is no longer a low-confidence guy. But I’m still the same, struggling with anxiety. He now has a group of friends apart from me, and he spends most of the day with them. I feel like after some days, I’ll be completely alone.

I feel really bad and sad. I thought I finally found a real friend after four years, but it wasn’t the case. Time changed, but my anxiety didn’t. In fact, now my anxiety even has a physical impact on my body — like my left eye automatically starts blinking whenever I feel socially anxious in social situations.

1pfwfxw,The confusing part of improving social anxiety: not knowing who would still respect you if you slipped,"There’s a specific confusion that comes with getting better at masking or managing social anxiety. People start treating you with more respect, more ease, more interest. And instead of feeling relieved, you end up stuck with a question you can’t answer:

Would they still treat me this way if I showed the anxious version of myself again?

It turns progress into a strange, conflicted space. You want to believe the positive reactions are genuine, but part of you wonders if you’re only being treated well because they assume you’re confident now. You can’t tell whether you’re finally being seen accurately, or whether you’re just fitting into the version of you they prefer.

And the harder part is wanting to know the truth without actually wanting to risk slipping back into the anxious behavior to find out. So you stay caught in this loop of improvement mixed with uncertainty, unsure which relationships are real and which ones rely on you keeping the vulnerable parts hidden.",1765046161.0,socialanxiety

Needless to say I want to be there on his wedding day because I understand that they’re important.

Most of my family and my FSIL’s (future sister in law) family are aware that I have social anxiety, I’ve struggled with it since I was 13. Something as little as going to a restaurant with 5 other people can be overwhelming so the thought of a wedding is scary. I haven’t been directly asked to be anything in the wedding; Best man, maid of honour, whose giving my FSIL away have all been chosen (bridesmaids are be discussed) I’m happy to just be there, not having a ‘duty’ helps as I won’t be expected to do anything that might be difficult but there’s still a chance I may be asked to be a bridesmaid.

Weddings are loud, there will be a lot of people, yes some people I know but that factor doesn’t make a huge difference when anxiety flairs up. I want to be there for both my brother and my FSIL but sometimes I’m able to ‘tell’ if my anxiety will flair up and I know it will at the wedding. It’s a side note to mention that we lost someone in our family recently and their absence from the wedding will definitely be felt (grief is extremely hard to push down and it has triggered my anxiety on occasion).

A part of me is expecting that closer to the date, my Mother may ask me if I want to go at all (in a genuine way). I want to be strong and to be there for them but it’s a terrifying prospect. I don’t want to be closed off in a corner, pretending I can’t be seen by anyone or have to keep hiding away in a different room or outside. 
I have my childhood plushie that I take absolutely everywhere with me as it’s the single best thing that grounds me when I get flair ups but I’m aware of how ridiculous I may seem as an adult clutching a toy for dear life at a wedding. 

I really don’t know what to do, I want to show that I care about this for both my brother and FSIL but I can’t deny I’m terrified either.",1765023676.0,socialanxiety
1pfndgq,My social anxiety is absolutely destroying my life,"My social anxiety has reached a dangerous level, and I don't know what to do. I'm in school, and I can only chat with my desk mate; I can't talk to anyone else. During roll call in class, I even hesitate to say ""here."" What if my voice doesn't come out, or the teacher doesn't hear me and asks if I'm here? I overthink every little thing I do. For example, in my course, I forgot my pencil case; I was even too shy to ask the people behind me if they had a spare pencil. I got a pencil, but the lead broke; I spent two hours thinking about how to ask for a refill, and then the guy behind me understood without me saying anything and handed me one, and I said ""thanks.""
At the beginning of the course, I fell for the prettiest girl in class and developed a crush, but because of my issue, I couldn't imagine it going anywhere. Two weeks passed, and despite my extreme introversion, the girl found my number and confessed to me. We met and started flirting, but it only lasted 5 days. I was the one who ended it again, because it was such a weird situation: The person in front of me is super energetic, social, and does everything without shame; meanwhile, this was the first time in my life I'd connected with a girl, the first time I'd talked to a girl for that long, and I had no idea how to handle it. I constantly talked to the girl through AI. Actually, I don't know, I'm extremely obsessed with the past; I've experienced big events and kept bottling them all up inside.
Everything started towards the end of 7th grade. Two guys fixated on me over some issue and poisoned my entire year. I don't know if it's right to call it peer bullying, because physically I could handle them, but psychologically they put a lot of pressure on me. I won't go into details, or this post will get really long. Anyway, middle school ended, LGS (high school entrance exam) came; I took it, but despite going to cram school for 3 years, I just winged it and left without caring. Maybe the best time of my life was the summer after 8th grade, after all that unpleasantness. When placing into high school, I got into a decent place with my GPA, and luckily, I ended up in the same class as my childhood friend; adapting was really easy. Whatever happened, it was during the 15-day break: My friend made an unforgivable mistake, and our closeness completely broke off. A week later, in an empty class period, some unbalanced guy lit a cigar, everyone took a puff; I did too like everyone else, and someone recorded me on video, and that video became really popular both in class and at school. Maybe this event triggered my anxiety the most, I'm not sure, but 9th grade ended.
When starting 10th grade, on the first day of school, I was shocked: My class had been changed for some stupid reason, supposedly to balance the number of classes in the school. Anyway, the moment I entered my new class, I didn't talk to anyone; even a guy in the back who was also new to the class tried really hard to be friends, but it was in vain—I, being soulless, gave no reaction. For 3 weeks in my new class, I didn't connect with anyone; I just slept in the front row. And finally, thinking maybe if I go back to my old class everything will fix itself, I managed to switch back with difficulty: I talked to the guidance counselor, went to a psychologist and got a report, talked at length with the assistant principal, and somehow got back to my class.
Now, it's been almost 2 months since I switched back to my old class, and school sucks. The assholes in class acted like they never knew me from the beginning and didn't give a shit about my return; I didn't talk to anyone either, because I'm introverted. But somehow, this situation only happens at school, in courses, or in any social setting. However, in life, I have 3 real friends I can call ""brother"" who truly value me; when I'm with them, my social anxiety drops to 0, like a whole new personality emerges, straight out of Tyler Durden. I want this not just with them, but in every moment of my life.
I know the problem is entirely in me, and the only person who can change it is me, but even the smallest things seem impossible to me: Saying hi to someone, starting a conversation, etc. I don't know what to do. I'm sure no one will give a shit about this post, but at least I'm venting to real people, not AI.",1765021362.0,socialanxiety

You need to be someone worth getting to know, but the way I am now, people don’t feel any reason or motivation to talk to me.

***

I was 14 when covid hit, even long before then I had started distancing myself from my peers, friends and family. School life wasn't about learning, it was about surviving countless humiliation rituals by my peers and teachers. I came home and checked out for the day, waste the rest of the day on the computer or console. Anything but to live in reality. 

Covid was a blessing for me, at least so I thought at the time. I didn't have to pretend to care anymore, I could disregard all of my duties, relationships and even my future. And so I did. This of course was recognized by everyone as laziness, which makes sense from an outside perspective.

And nobody cared, not even my parents. Years later I would find out they knew about my struggles with social phobia but decided to do nothing out of fear that forcing me to a therapist would ""make things worse."" But I can't blame them, we've always been poor, uneducated and too preoccupied with our own vices to truly care about one another.

I remember walking out of the graduation hall in mid 2021, having barely passed high school. After hours spent in a tight packed space of people, sweating and borderline unable to breathe, it was a relieve. Going on stage wasn't as bad as I had thought it would be, the lights blinded me in a way so that I couldn't see the massive crowd, thank God. I grabbed the graduation class photo from J. and trudged my way across the parking lot to my parents and their car. 

""Let's go home.""
""What? Sweetie, don't you want to go to the graduation party?""
""I don't ever want to see any of these fucking people ever again.""

I meant it, and I haven't seen any of them since. First time I swore unapologetically in front of my parents. We got in the car, spent half an hour driving home in complete silence, well.. besides the pop slop playing on the radio. (insert any popular pop song in summer 21') Quite ironic given the mood of the entire day.

We got home, I went inside and went to bed. I got up around 4pm the day before graduation, it was now 3pm and I had been absolutely drained from being awake so long. I had spent the last couple of days agonizing about this event, in turn ruinning my sleep schedule. Actually I don't think I've ever had a sleep schedule. Half of the days of my life I went to bed right after school, to wake up in the late evening or early night.

And that's where I've been since. In a cycle of isolation, unable to help myself out, or get help. I tried to become a video editor, it worked for a bit till my anxiety crushed me and I ruined myself, again.

I'm isolated from the world, I live in delusion. I'm too conscious of myself to not be afraid of anyone. I bring out the trash in the middle of the night because I'm terrified of being seen. I avoid windows and mirrors. My health will put me in the ground before 25. The thought of getting groceries is gruelling and requires a pep talk. All of my clothes are old, ruined or don't fit. Hairstylists terrify me. I'm unemployed and broke. I reached out to two therapists, both were full and told me to go to the part of the local hospital where they treat schizophrenics and suicidals 💀 

Dead ass, that's not a joke, I wish any of this was. I'd die there. I could go on but if your reading this you get it already. I'm at the foot of Mount Everest, I have to climb to the top to live, but I have no climbing gear or oxygen.

I'm cooked 🥀

If anybody has read this for some reason I hope you have a good day. If you have social anxiety, just know there's always someone who has it worse, so be hopeful in being able to fix yourself 🫡

The cycle continues. Maybe one day I can break out and make something that'll help people like me. I'd like to write some books about it.

I tried opening up to my mom about what I’m going through and told her I was gonna apply for SSI, and she turned around and said this to me literally after I woke up:



My mom’s texts (word for word):
> “I’m sorry Nina but you’re not riding with me anymore thing is I pays out if my picket ti get you fair I took my time in between working to do your hair you says when I was done you’d be all over getting a regular job I give 0 fux about you writing or anything else do that after you start bringing in way more not only for the house/apt whatever and to but what you need/want Nina I’m freaking tired of No Help and you can go wherever you want but you would so fucked yo after all this time you being at home not really doing anything.

I’m sorry to go off but you are not about your word please do your part like you promised after I did your hair”



> “You do t want a job you want ti do government ish that’s not the way to go”



I’m only 18. She puts this pressure on me like I’m supposed to be paying every bill she has. She keeps saying I can’t ride with her anymore (we’d do GrubHub together and it was one of the only times we actually got to hangout). She told me to get her $150 last week, and I tried, but it didn’t work out and now everything has blown up.

I tried to explain that job interviews terrify me. I get scared I’ll mess up, go to the wrong place, embarrass myself, if I'll fidget too much, if the silence will be too loud, I don't want to make a fool of myself. I’ve been dealing with social anxiety for years since I was in 8th grade, and when I turned 18 I thought maybe I was finally being myself... but it didn’t stick. On top of that, I have ADHD and depression, so just functioning feels like a battle.

She doesn’t care about any of this. She says things like “stop blaming mental health” and even once told me I’d “go to hell” if I killed myself, only caring about her religious views over me. She threatens to kick me out if I don’t make the money she wants. My dad would do the exact same thing. And I have nowhere else to go—no relatives I can stay with, no connections, nothing. She applied for Medicaid/other programs already so I can’t apply separately, and SSI would take too long anyway.

I just feel trapped. Either I magically get a job despite my anxiety or I end up homeless. I keep thinking maybe if I say the right thing she’ll understand, but she never does. I feel like I’m not even her kid anymore, just a useless roommate who’s burdening her.

I don’t know how to cope with this or how to handle the pressure. I need actual solutions to figure this shit out but I don't even know what I'm supposed to do. Like I didn't get the opportunity to get a job when I was a teenager like everybody else did. I was stuck at home only doing microtasks and micro earnings to get by and satisfy my mom's needs, but even then it's never enough. I feel like even though she claims that she wouldn't take my entire paycheck. At this point I'm convinced that she absolutely would take my entire paycheck just to make up for all the months that I didn't pay her.



TL;DR: I’m 18, dealing with social anxiety, ADHD, and depression. I opened up to my mom and she responded with long angry messages telling me to stop blaming mental health, get a job “even McDonald’s,” and that I can’t ride with her anymore. She threatens to kick me out if I don’t make money. I have no other place to go. I feel trapped and don’t know how to handle the pressure or what to do next.",1764983539.0,socialanxiety
1pfc4w8,Fear VS Discomfort in social settings,"Lately I've been thinking about whether there is a meaningful distinction between fear and discomfort in socially avoidant people. 

*Fear* is actively worrying about social situations and believing (or even just feeling) like things will go badly, while *discomfort* is feeling stressed and overwhelmed in the presence of others. There is large overlap between these two in most people, and discomfort is an inevitable consequence of fear.

I make the distinction for myself because I only really experience the discomfort anymore, at least to any significant degree. It's so bad that I feel the need to completely distance myself from people, but I don't experience any conscious fear. Maybe I've just repressed the fear by emotionally isolating myself and I'm afraid of being afraid again if that makes sense. Maybe that's what that discomfort is, but I don't know. 

Anxiety is specifically about excessive fear and worrying, so I'm not too sure that what I have can be considered social anxiety anymore. If it isn't then I don't know how to describe what's wrong with me. Does anyone relate to this?

1pfbmbc,How do you personally combat the fear of persecution?,"Hi everyone.

I have my own ways of combatting this issue. It is one of my recent, yet strongest aspects of social anxiety. I can’t enjoy public spaces without feeling of extreme judgement from everyone. I think everyone is out to get me, harm me, and make sure they know I am inferior to them. I know this is an anxiety response and in reality a lot of the signs I feel people give me, don’t in fact make sense.

I combat this by wearing ear-defenders in public. Not only does this calm me down as I am sensitive to loud noises, but I do think it is a signal to people that I am sensitive, therefore they will treat me better. 

I also tend to be very passive and submissive. When I walk I yield to others consistently, even if they weren’t going to walk my way. I avoid eye contact consistently with others walking past and watch my feet. I feel like these motions give people the opportunity to further push their authority on me. I often feel like a punching bag to others because I don’t speak up. I see this as a coping skill because it feels more comfortable to me rather than showing signs of confidence (eye contact, good posture, fierce walk) 

I was wondering if anyone had anything else that has helped them. The stuff I’ve learned, combatting the thoughts and everything, has helped but I still get incredibly uncomfortable in public. It has made me unable to relax in public and exhausted.

Thanks.",1764981379.0,socialanxiety
1pfbkq3,Shh… The Quiet Revolution,"The rise of the introvert!

A guide for channeling neurosis also known as OCD, ADHD, ADD Depression and Anxiety into creative or genius talent.

Our everlasting will to live and it’s seeking of survival presents us with a concept most people deviate from because it does not apply to their personality type and this concept is Perfectionism. The drive of continuous improvement. “Perfectionism is what the consciousness seeks to truly liberate itself and give in to the unconscious.”

Ever wonder why you toss and turn at night unable to sleep, thinking of ways to improve your life? Well we can blame the drive to perfection for that.

Here’s how to channel that drive to talent;
Nietzsche, Kauffman, Kant and Freud all speak about sublimation. An example of that would be sublimed sexuality (A sexual impulse that can be channeled into a creative spiritual activity instead of being full-filled directly) the same can be said for “Intrusive Thoughts.”

But how do we do that? This can be accomplished by allowing the neurosis to temporarily take over, like that it’s not being repressed but instead sublimed and channeled for your benefit.

Let’s use the example of someone wanting to t0rture their foe- that can be sublimated into the desire to defeat one’s rival in a contest or “Creative Battle” Therefore,  sublimating the violent nature of the thought and instead translating it to rational and creative thinking.

Now let’s bring it back to more realistic scenario- say it’s 11pm, you’re laying in bed and the thought “I’m not good enough” comes forward instead of pushing that thought away give into it temporarily and see what the root cause is, you will not be able to figure out the root cause of the thought unless you give in to it. Close your eyes, and feed it. Think “who says I’m not good enough? Why do I want to be good enough? And let the neurosis do the rest. Eventually the thought will pass and you will return to a “normal” functioning state. 

However, this time when the neurosis returns with that same thought you can now tackle it with rationality and creativity instead of fear. Slowly un reveling the root cause and eventually getting rid of the thought all together.

Within time the neurosis will be replaced by rational and creative thinking that can be channeled and harnessed for future  life guidance.

Have fun!

1pfb9yw,"Went to work Xmas party, here is what helped..","I'd been dreading it for weeks, It was hell but I managed to go through it. Me surrounded by 12 extroverts in a packed venue. Nowhere to hide. What helped was the following:

1. Lemon balm supplements.  I took 3 capsules previous night and then the night of party took a capsule at 4pm and then at 7pm. The supplement has 2400mg Lemon Balm per capsule. It really helped with the physical symptoms.  Allowed me to simply ignore the negative thoughts and awkward moments.  It was MVP for me and I'll be using it for the future.  This must be what it is like to use medication or not have social anxiety.  I wasn't freaking out and not frowning, which I normally do when anxious.

2.  This was an extreme method but it did help me alleviate the anxiety a little bit.  And that was what ""if this was my last day alive.""  It could be the lemon balm but this helped me not overthink before the event.  

3.  Don't expect a result.  If you think in terms of ""I want this conversation or activity to go well"".  You put pressure on yourself which is not needed, especially if your battling anxiety. So I just engaged in activity regardless of the result. If I wanted to be quiet, I remained quiet rather than forcing myself to talk.  Awkward moments I ignored, it's part of the social anxiety.

If you check my post history, I always dread the work events.  This was hell but I got through it.  Now I'm on wind down and will try to avoid ruminating on the event. Hope this helps anyone who needs it.",1764980424.0,socialanxiety
1pf9xxb,Volunteering was the unexpected cure for my lifelong social anxiety,"I want to share something that genuinely changed my life, and I hope it might help someone else here who's struggling like I was.

For as long as I can remember, social anxiety has controlled my life. I was bullied pretty badly growing up, and it left deep scars that followed me into adulthood. Over the years, I developed this core belief that people were generally cold, judgmental, and unaccepting. Every social interaction felt like walking through a minefield. I was constantly bracing myself for rejection or mockery. It was exhausting.

About 15 years ago, I decided to join a volunteer group in my area. Honestly, I almost backed out a dozen times before that first meeting. But something in me was desperate enough to try anything.

The difference was immediate and shocking. People were... nice. Genuinely nice. And I started to realize why. These were people who cared enough about something to give their time for free. There was a sincerity there that I'd rarely encountered before. They weren't there because they had to be or because they were getting paid. They wanted to be there, and that changed everything about how they interacted.

Here's what really got me: because volunteer groups are always looking for people to join, they actually *wanted* me there. For the first time in my life, I felt welcomed with open arms. I felt respected. Not tolerated, not grudgingly accepted, actually respected and valued. I can't overstate how powerful that feeling was for someone who'd spent years believing they were fundamentally unlikeable.

The real growth came when we'd go out on activities that involved talking to strangers. I won't lie, some people would brush me off or outright reject what we were saying. The old me would have spiraled from that, convinced it was personal, that I was the problem. But here's the thing: I had people with me. When someone rejected me, my teammates would reassure me it was okay, that it happens to everyone, that it wasn't about me personally. They'd console me, encourage me, and we'd move on to the next person together.

Those experiences taught me more about human nature than years of therapy ever could. I learned that rejection is often situational, not personal. I learned that most people are dealing with their own stuff and aren't examining me the way I feared. I learned that I could handle discomfort and come out okay on the other side.

Today, my social anxiety has diminished so much that sometimes I can't believe it's the same person. I can strike up conversations with strangers. I can attend social events without that crushing dread. And here's what really gets me... multiple people have told me that I'm a warm person, that they genuinely enjoy my company. Me. The person who spent decades convinced they were socially broken.

I'm not saying this to brag. I'm saying it because if you'd told me a 15 years ago this was possible, I would never have believed you. And if I can get here, maybe you can too.

**A few important notes:**

Please don't ask me which specific group I joined. I'm not here to promote any particular organization. The point isn't the specific cause; it's that volunteer groups in general tend to create this environment. Because they need people, because everyone there chose to be there, because there's a shared purpose... it creates a uniquely accepting atmosphere.

That said: please be careful and look into things before joining. Unfortunately, some groups that present themselves as volunteer organizations can have cult-like qualities. Trust your instincts. If something feels off, if there's excessive attention at first, if they discourage you from maintaining outside relationships, get out. A healthy volunteer group should enhance your life, not consume it or isolate you.

But if you find a legitimate cause you care about; environmental, animal welfare, community service, human rights, whatever speaks to you. I really encourage you to give it a shot. You don't have to commit to anything huge at first. Just show up once. See how it feels.

For me, it was the beginning of getting my life back. I hope sharing this helps someone else take that first terrifying step.",1764976869.0,socialanxiety

I also live with two other classmates. For the last few months, I’ve been getting more and more drained by the fact that’s they’re so much more extroverted and chatty than I am. They often want to all go out and just chat and to be honest I love them but I can’t handle constantly talking over texts and hanging out all the time. It’s often in groups of 5-10 people and it’s just too much for me. I go to some outings and participate in conversations but I worry that it comes across as me not wanting to hang out with them specifically.

When I don’t go to outings, I either stay home or go to my boyfriends bc it’s quieter and we usually stay indoors. Essentially, I’m just worried that me not going to as many outings or hanging out with my boyfriend instead will be interpreted poorly. Recently, I’ve had people telling me that ‘I don’t hang out with them anymore’ despite going to some still and practically being with them everyday already. Any input or advice is appreciated.

1pf3uqi,I Really Wonder What's Wrong With Me,"So, I have social anxiety, as you might well expect from the sub I'm posting this in. Among many other negative side effects, this also means that getting into a relationship is hard.

I've been in relationships before. Four, in fact. One girlfriend I met at a party when I was 17, before my social anxiety was as bad. My second girlfriend I just happened to coincidentally meet on social media. And my third (6 years) and fourth (1 year) girlfriends I met on dating apps.

Which brings me to what I want to talk about.

If talking about things like dating apps, matches, etc. makes you uncomfortable, stop here.

Anyway, I won't specify exactly how long. But I've been on several dating apps for quite a long time now. I haven't been using them continuously. I've kind of had periods where I use them intensively. And then long periods of time where I don't or barely use them at all. But point is, it has been a long time.

And in that time I don't know exactly what number of matches I've gotten. But I'm relatively sure that it is at least more than 100.

And of these 100+ people, I have been ghosted every, single, time.

Every single time.

Sometimes it's after one message (which is particularly odd), sometimes it's after a day of talking, sometimes two or three, in rare instances maybe a week. But eventually it always happens. We're talking and, poof, they stop responding.

Now, look. Sometimes people don't click. That's fine. I get that. And, yeah, some conversations I felt were probably not moving in a fantastic direction. So I totally get not continuing to talk then.

But there are other times where the conversation seems to be going well. We seem to have a lot in common, we're both making jokes, everything seems like it's going pretty well. And still, poof, they're suddenly gone. Never to come back.

Now, there have been some instances where I have been asked out. But, of course, because of my social anxiety going out with someone after talking for like an hour, is just not something I can do. I need more time than that. I need to feel like I know someone at least a little bit. Then I can maybe face the insane anxiety-inducing awfulness that is a first date.

And what do those people do who asked me out and I said, basically, that I was interested but needed a bit more time? They said it was totally fine and they understood. And then they ghosted me.

And after being single for... quite a long time now. Longest I have been in over a decade. And after being ghosted literally over a hundred times. I can't help but feel like utter trash.

Like, obviously, in those cases where I was asked out and declined my social anxiety stood in the way. And obviously sometimes you just don't click. But what about those dozens of other people? Why did they ghost me?

Like... what is so wrong with me? That's what I just find myself asking myself. What is so wrong with me? I just feel so worthless and unloveable.

And the thing is, aside from just wanting to feel loved, I like being in a relationship. I'm a relationship person. I love cuddling, and sending sweet messages to each other in the morning, and walking hand in hand down the street, and giving each other surprises, and cooking together, and so many other things. I just love being able to look a woman in the eyes and tell her I love her and hear her say it back. I just love that stuff. I have a high desire for closeness and intimacy.

But at the same time after having been single for such a long time and ghosted so often, I feel hopeless. With my social anxiety I don't see myself finding someone IRL. So dating apps or a chance social media meeting (very low odds) are basically the only options I have. And last time I found girlfriends that way. But now I just can't seem to anymore. And I fear deeply that I'm going to spend my alone.

And it just literally makes me wonder what the point is and makes me want to die.

So, yeah, TLDR... I can't find anyone. I keep getting ghosted. And I just deeply fear never finding my soulmate, and I miss having a girlfriend, and I feel so utterly and completely worthless and undesireable.",1764961995.0,socialanxiety

I got kicked out of every group I tried to join, and that has led to me being afraid of trying to talk to anyone. The simple act of trying to ask something to someone makes me feel extremely embarrassed of being myself (it sounds weird, but that's how I feel it). Everyone I see around me has such an ease to talk to everyone and laugh at everything (I'm from a country known for its sociable values). I tried to join a college club because I like photography and art (although I'm a beginner) and I wanted to join to a group of people once and for all, and I can feel it; I can see the same uncomfortable gaze from every person I try to approach, and I know it's due to the way I look and my facial expressions.

1peyuki,extrover to introvert w social anxiety,"Hello, I am a 24-year-old woman and I’m in a crisis. Ever since I was little, I was a quiet child, I didn’t draw much attention to myself, I always had that one solid friendship with someone but I knew how to interact and make friends. Growing up, I was bullied, nothing too extreme, but I was always that particular one with niche interests. Then in high school I didn’t really know how to make new friends or interact until I became friends with a girl in particular, very outgoing and genuine, and I started copying her behavior. From that moment on, people started talking to me more, boys would approach me, and everything was going great. Then we went separate ways for university and things continued to go well for a while, until I overdid it with smoking weed and going to parties, mostly just to feel accepted.

That is where the crisis began. I fell into depression, I became unrecognizable, I smoked all day, DPDR emerged, and I started changing how I saw people. I was focused entirely on myself and I stopped talking to everyone. After that came another phase. I wasn’t doing drugs anymore, I removed all my piercings, I started studying and committing myself again, but I had lost all the connections I once had, except for one group of friends.

A few months later I went abroad for Erasmus and I was completely reborn. I became everything I wanted to be, I looked good, I took care of myself though with ups and downs, and thanks to a girl I lived with who had a personality similar to the one I knew in high school, but also maybe thanks to the “mood” I had, I made a lot of friends. A year has passed and I am still here living with my boyfriend in the same student residence where we met. And now I have realized that I don’t know how to talk to people anymore. I spent most of my life seeing people who struggled to interact as weird, and now I have ended up being like them. I understand them now, and I would actually love to meet people like me.

When I talk I feel strange. I come out with weird things, I think I exaggerate my facial expressions, because the person I am talking to suddenly opens their eyes wide. I am trying to study how to approach people and the advice I get is to show interest in the other person, but I can’t, the words don’t come out, or if they do they come out confused. I feel alone and the anxiety is overwhelming.

Is there anyone who feels the same way or who has gone through something similar? If so, what advice can you give me? Sorry for the english but i've written it without being lucid",1764950561.0,socialanxiety

Either way,  I’m a teen in hs but I’m well learned at a little bit competitive so I’ve always been on top, rn I have the highest gpa in our grade but this friend’s always making weird jokes.

Like joking about how I got lucky or how it’s just because she gets headaches sometimes. She often feels the need to over correct me and speak over me at all times even if she ends up being wrong and even then, it’s just another excuse of what she actually meant and no apology.

At one point we were talking about college essays and my teacher said not to trauma-dump because the college admission officers are probably used to reading about trauma. I, because the class was dead, felt the need to make a joke at my expense. I said something along the lines of…I don’t know about that, my trauma’s pretty special…I might earn a full ride off of that alone. 

I know that people around the globe go through a lot so I expected like ppl to laugh at the ridiculous joke which some people did but the friend looked straight into my eyes and was like “Be so serious…you know your trauma’s not that special” and I had to sit there for a moment because we’ve kinda been friends for years and I’ve told her a lot about my life. It was never really a friendship in the traditional sense now that I think about it, just her sticking to me because I was one of her first friends and her only friend for a little while. 

And when I was speaking, she was always off-handedly listening before redirecting the conversation to her but it still hurt. It sounded like she was joking though and I do have a tendency to overthink this.

She said ‘Why is your hand so shaky?’ and I was kinda surprised she commented on that, and I said ‘I have a lot of anxiety about this trip’. Then not even 20 seconds later she tells someone else who was in the same room ‘You see how much his hand is shaking?!’.

What the heck?! New insecurity unlocked - Thanks! Now I have this recurring thought implanted in my head: ‘What if my hand shakes when I show my flight details at the airport? What if it shakes as I pay for food, or when I try to check in at the hotel?’

I'm in my mid-30s and feel like I haven't arrived in life, havent grown up and  be career driven and also kind of worthless.

1pebcur,Is it normal to have horrible weeks of anxiety even taking sertraline? And that one good day it seems like “my true self”?,"Hello.
I have been taking sertraline (50 mg) for 6 weeks. Most of the time I've been doing more or less well, but this last week has been horrible and I don't understand why.

I had an incredible day on Monday. I felt like I was the real me, without anxiety: I talked to everyone, I felt connected to people, I felt safe and socially in tune. It was the feeling I had for a long time, as if everyone was “on my level”, without feeling anyone superior. It was a very nice day.

But since then... fatal.
I have had severe anxiety attacks in class. The other day I had a brutal peak: nausea, desire to vomit, shaking, dry mouth, cold hands... I had to ask to go to the bathroom because I thought I was going to faint or vomit in front of everyone. Just imagining it made me panic and now I'm afraid it will happen to me again in class.

I don't understand it because I've been on the medication for a while. Part of me thinks maybe 50 mg isn't enough, but I also know not to change the dosage on my own. It frustrates me to feel so bad just when the sertraline is supposed to be stabilized.

I'm also in exam time and very stressed, so I don't know if everything comes from there. Still, it's very hard to go from such a good day (where I seemed to be myself again) to such a bad week.

Has anyone else had very good days and then horrible days even while taking sertraline?
Is it normal for anxiety to return so strongly due to stress?
Have you had that feeling that “me without anxiety” is much more sociable and secure, and that the bad days cover up everything?

Any advice or experience would be very helpful. Thank you.",1764881287.0,socialanxiety

I find it hard to talk to people, because nobody wants to talk to me, because I'm a closed off guy. I don't let people know more than they should. And, I don't really mind that... but for some reason, I do want to talk to people, but at the same time, I don't want to talk to anyone. I'm a boring person, and I hate that.

And then I think to myself. ""I'm a worthless human being."", ""I don't benefit anyone by existing"", which to be honest, I don't benefit anyone. I just simply exist. I have a few friends from other classes, but even they don't really have full-blown conversations with me. We just chat for like half a minute and it's done.

Sometimes I feel so mad that I just want to KILL everyone around me. I haven't made friends with ANYONE in my classroom since I joined. NOT A SINGLE FRIEND. I wonder what my classmates think of my awkwardness. Do they hate me? Dislike me?

1pe7vq7,How to handle group projects with social anxiety,"I have social anxiety and depression. I've had anxiety since I was a kid and I'm an adult now, studying in university. My studies have been fine except when our classes include group work. They're often worth more than half of the grade so very big projects. It's almost always a group of four or sometimes three, it doesn't really matter since I won't be talking and voicing my ideas either way. So as I mentioned, during our group meetings, I'm mostly silent, sometimes agreeing and speaking only when someone directly asks my opinion. And even then I feel like thousands of people are watching me and if I say one wrong word I'm getting thrown off a cliff as a punishment. I find it very hard to get the courage to speak when the other group members are more talkative and say the thing I had in mind before me. In these situations my mind is basically in freeze mode and my anxiety is through the roof so thoughts are very hard to form and it feels very discouraging to hear the only idea I had in mind be said by someone else. I basically lost my chance to participate and now the subject has already changed. I might tell about my ideas later in our group chat by text which is way more comfortable for me.

The times I have tried to speak up, I end up getting silence back. I don't understand why? Yes my sentences are rather short, but I've voiced my concern and now suddenly nobody has anything to say? It's very awkward, as if the situation wasn't uncomfortable enough. I don't want to talk much since I often stutter and forget basic words which makes me look stupid. It makes me feel depressed and I just try to suffer through the meeting while guilt and other bad feelings creep up.

  
I don't know. How can I improve this? Has anyone felt this way and somehow overcame it? Since I've been in multiple group meetings weekly now and I still feel the same, maybe worse. It's not boosting my confidence as often happens when you keep doing something and realize it wasn't so bad.. I desperately want to be able to contribute my part and I don't want my group members to think I'm slacking off on purpose.

I know I need therapy but the irony is that calling therapists and doing intake appointments triggers the exact anxiety I need help with.

I've had the insurance provider list open on my laptop for three weeks. I've picked up my phone to call probably 20 times and then chickened out. when I finally forced myself to leave a voicemail last week I was shaking so bad I could barely talk and I'm sure I sounded completely unstable. they never called back which just confirmed my fear that I'm too much of a mess for anyone to help.

my parents are getting frustrated with me because from their perspective I'm just not trying hard enough. they don't get that the process of finding help IS the thing I need help with. they keep saying just make the call, just go to the appointment, like it's that simple. if it was that simple I would've done it already.

I looked into online options because at least typing is easier than talking but betterhelp and those apps don't take insurance and I can't afford $300 a month when I'm not even employed. I need to use my dad's insurance but that means finding an actual therapist and making actual phone calls and doing actual intake appointments and the whole thing feels impossible.

1pe2x6q,Sertraline experience,"Hello everyone. Yesterday, Tuesday, I completed my sixth week taking 50 mg of sertraline, although I previously took 25 mg for 10 days so my body could adjust. The first week was probably the worst in terms of anxiety, although I’m doing better now. But this week has been awful — a lot of anxiety, negative thoughts… And maybe it has to do with the fact that I’m in exam season, but honestly, it’s been terrible. And I thought I was going to have a really good week, because on Monday I felt fine, sociable and all that, but these past few days have been awful. I wanted to know if something similar has happened to anyone else.

1pe0fmk,Im practicing small talk with AI before social events and it's actually reducing my panic attacks,"I have social anxiety and small talk is literally my worst nightmare. I freeze up, can't think of anything to say, generally give stupid answers then spend hours afterwards replaying every awkward silence and convincing myself everyone thinks I'm weird.

My therapist suggested exposure therapy but the thought of forcing myself into social situations before I'm ready just makes my anxiety worse, so I started practicing conversations with an AI first as a middle step ik it sounds ridiculous but its actually helping me build confidence without the pressure of real people judging me irl

I can practice asking follow up questions, work on thinking less about finding perfect responses, experiment with being vulnerable without worrying I said something wrong. It's low stakes enough that I don't spiral into panic but still feels like actual conversation practice.

Ive been doing this for about a month and went to a work social last week, still nervous but didn't have a panic attack beforehand for the first time ever. Baby steps but any progress with social anxiety feels massive when you've been struggling for years

1pdwq14,Social life,"I've got a pretty simple question, but it seems like a lot of adults are dealing with it silently:
Do you become ""alone surrounded"" as you get into your twenties or thirties?

I see more and more people moving, changing jobs, getting into routines... and one thing always comes up: friend circles shrink, meeting new people becomes rare, and even when you go out or run into people, the conversations often stay super shallow.

I feel like a lot of us feel this way:
being in a bar or at a party, surrounded by people... but not really connected.
Wanting to share a simple moment, without really having anyone to do it with.
Or just thinking: ""Is it just me, or has it become really hard to make new friends after a certain age?""

So, I'd be super curious to hear your thoughts:
• Is this something you're experiencing too?
• Has it become harder to connect with people than before, in your opinion?
• How do you do it (or how would you like to do it) to meet new people these days?

1pdvcu5,"You're not nervous, you're excited","One of my favorite perspective changers is knowing that being nervous is 'effectively' the same as being excited.

I appreciate this isn't for everyone, but I can't tell you how much it's helped my social anxiety.

Let me expalin.

You know that feeling! Heart racing. Tight chest. Shallow breath. Sweaty palms.  
You label it: nerves. Your brain quietly adds: discomfort and danger

Here’s what’s wild: on a purely biological level, that state is almost identical to excitement.

In both cases, your sympathetic nervous system is switched on – your built-in “get ready” mode. Your adrenal glands release adrenaline and noradrenaline, your heart pumps harder, blood flow shifts to your muscles, your breathing speeds up to pull in more oxygen. The gut slows down, which is why you feel those “butterflies” or ""sinking feeling"".

Chemically, it’s the same family of signals your body uses when something matters and you need to be more alert, more focused, more ready to act.

So what makes one feel awful and the other feel electric?

The brain’s interpretation layer.

When you’re anxious, regions like the amygdala flag the situation as threat. Your prefrontal cortex then spins up worst-case scenarios, and your attention locks onto what could go wrong.

When you’re excited, much of the same arousal is there, but your brain’s reward circuits are more involved. The story becomes: “There’s potential here. Something good might happen.” Same body; different prediction. You get that feeling of wanting something to come.

Emotions are basically:  
body sensations + brain prediction + story.

You can’t always control the first part. A big moment will light up your system. That’s biology doing its job.

But you can influence the prediction and the story.

Next time you feel that surge before something important, don’t fight the sensations or assume they mean you’re not ready. Notice the racing heart, the fizz, the heat and tell yourself:

“This is my body mobilising. These are the same signals as excitement. My system is gearing up to help me perform.”

YOu switch from fear and danger to excitement and engagement.

Then point your mind at the opportunity – the idea you want to land, the person you want to be proud of, the possibility on the other side.

You’re not pretending you’re relaxed. You’re doing something smarter:

Letting the biology of “nervous” become fuel for “excited”.",1764839116.0,socialanxiety
1pdtfth,awkward relations with people,"I don't know if anyone else will relate, but as a socially awkward/anxious person, Ive had many awkward experiences with people throughout my life. I don't want to get specific, because its embarrassing, and even though its probably extremely unlikely, I worry that one of the people I was awkward with might be on this reddit and realize who i am.

But whenever i have an awkward experience with someone, in my head i feel like Ive ruined any hope of having further relations with that person. like Ive messed up and i have to find a new person to be friends with. I want to go outside and be social and just talk to people, but im afraid that i might run into someone Ive been awkward to in the past, because there are literally so many. 

And its not just in my head, i have literally seen people who Ive been awkward with in the past at my gym and where i work. (which are essentially the only places i go where i could run into someone) Luckily ive never had to interact with them, i just saw them. But what if i am in a situation where i am forced to talk to one of these people. I imagine these scenarios in my head, like if im trying to make friends, and one of my new friends introduces me to someone who ive been awkward to in the past, that would just be a nightmare. I dont even know what i would say. These thoughts just fill me up with fear, and prevent me from going outside and being social. 

And its so annoying, because i could just talk to these people and pretend like those awkward encounters never happened. Or i could apologize, but i feel like you shouldn't have to apologize just for being awkward. Except for the ones where I literally just ignore people. Like this one time someone i knew from school waved at me and i just pretended like i didn't see them. I obviously did see them, but i literally have no social skills so i had to just ignore them. This was very awkward, and while they where still around i further pretended like i had no clue who they were, i played dumb. Even though i am a very aware person, and i feel like they 100% knew that i recognized them, which just made the whole experience just so awkward. 

Its weird because i am very aware as a person, im very curious and always looking around for something interesting, that's my nature i would say. but because of my social anxiety im forced to put my head and not look around too much in social situations, because what if i see someone i know, then i will be forced to interact with them, and that'll be awkward. so i just suppress my natural curiosity to avoid painful social interactions. its so stupid that i have to do this, but i do. I wish i just felt comfortable enough to have conversation with anyone.

its not even like i only struggle conversing with people who ived been awkward to in the past, its just anyone i know in general. but especially people who i know AND have awkward relations with. its just so silly to be afraid of social encounters. There are literally no real consequences, except the feeling of embarrassment. But i can take that, i shouldn't be scared of it, yet i am. Any-who, that's my spiel done. ",1764831688.0,socialanxiety

1pdpz2h,How do I become someone who exists?,"
I feel like a ghost.

I grew up in isolation. My parents neglected me, and I didn’t attend school consistently. Honestly, I don’t even know how I learned to read. I never got the chance to build social skills as a kid, and I’ve struggled to connect with people for as long as I can remember.

I’ve always felt like an outsider—like I don’t belong anywhere, like I’m in the wrong world but don’t have a place to call home. I’ve been homeless before and I’ve been through a lot of trauma. I’ve tried hard to make things better, and for a while I thought I was finally becoming a somewhat normal person. I found a way into college and worked toward a dream career. I had internships and relationships that looked normal from the outside, but I never truly connected with anyone—except my boyfriend. And now I feel like I’m just an extension of him, because I still don’t know how to connect with anyone else.

A few years ago I developed a chronic pain condition. It’s mostly pain and fatigue from the pain- but it’s still taken over my life. Being so sedentary has made my body decondition, and what felt manageable at first has slowly grown into something that has pulled me away from everything I tried to build. Now I just stay home. I don’t do much at all. I crochet and paint and listen to music and play single player video games and clean the house and just exist. Actually, i’m scared to leave the house. So ive just become a ghost that haunts my own home.

It feels like I’ve lost the will to live—without actually wanting to die. And I want to get better. But I dont know how to meet people or talk to people or connect to anyone. I barely know how to use technology. I feel like im floating on an isolated island in a world I dont understand. Im almost 30 and ive done nothing with my life, and I feel like I have no goals or aspirations left to pursue. ",1764820529.0,socialanxiety

1pdn517,i don’t know how to initiate convos or how to respond and i’m afraid its gonna ruin this thing i have going on with this guy.,"i have these issues with everyone but recently i’ve been talking to this guy i really like. normally the guys i’ve talked to before are extroverts and take the lead in convos most the time. this guy is a bit on the quieter side as well.

we’ve only been talking for a little bit but i don’t know how to naturally bring up conversations without them feeling out of place. this is an online thing so we often are calling and playing video games or watching movies or something, so i don’t wanna be random and just be like “hey what’s your favorite food” it just feels out of place.

even we he says something i can’t even think of how to respond most the time. for example the other day he was talking about how sore we was from going sledding and the only thing i could think of saying was “oh that’s not good”.. and he responded with “yeah i only have 24 hours left to live”and all i did was laugh and say something like “oh no, only 24 hrs” then the convo died shortly after that as expected.

i brought this up with him and asked him if it ever bothered him that i don’t talk much and he basically said “ehh not too much, i understand it. i do wanna get to know you more but i don’t wanna ask question after question. i feel like those things naturally come up in conversation. but i don’t wanna force you to act a certain way by a certain time. if it feels right, it feels right.” which reassured me a bit but still im worried about it.

i just don’t want to ruin this by not being able to socialize or think of anything to say. i just feel my mind drawing a blank all the time. i’ve always been like this. i just don’t know what to do or how to bring just up without it feeling out of place.",1764812605.0,socialanxiety

1pdmu0s,Have you ever gave a dumb response and felt embarrassed?,"
I have plenty of examples about my dumb responses to things. I’m really anxious if someone initiates a conversation and I tend to be really awkward. So much so that sometimes I can be physically stiff and barely move. Or I just shake my head when saying yes or acknowledging how bad something is. It depends on how comfortable I am about the person, situation, topic etc. if im anxious, I tend to just really blurt out or say something so weirdly worded. 

Like today on the bus. I work warehousing..a and was coming back on the bus with 3 talking coworkers. Me and this other guy had to get off to catch another bus home..before we left one guy asked me who does my hair and I just replied with the name of the lady who did maintenance on my hair. And he said “you acting like I know who that is” and I tried to remember the shop name but I didn’t. And I looked up the ceiling probably like how a character in a comic or cartoon does when thinking. And then I tried to make it less awkward by saying the street the lady’s shop in on and that it’s one the way to the job (since the bus to my job passes hers shop) i fist bumped the 2 people that stayed awkwardly and just got off the bus. Mind you I fist bumped them already when we were about to get off. I just went home repeating just that interaction in my head.

Another example is my mom knows this one lady who drives the bus. And to be honest I really don’t know her and I don’t recognize her whenever I take the bus. One time she was the driver to the train station and I didn’t notice. So when I had my headphones on waiting for the train she ran from the bus to greet me and ask me what was I up to and I said “my girlfriends town”. I don’t know that sounded to awkward to me at least I was kicking myself for that one too. 

I remember when my girlfriend’s sister came into her house with her boyfriend, and my gf was at college. My sister asked me where my girlfriend was and I felt awkward since I was laying on the couch watching a movie. And I said “she’s at the school” just another one for the books

To an extent, everyone has conversations in their head, but this feels like frantic rumination about every little thing I try to do. It's actually driving me nuts and I'm trying to catch myself whenever it happens but I'm so tired.

I'll give you an example so this makes more sense lol. In this example, let's say I'm decorating for Christmas, something that is fun for me. I'll think things like ""look at all this plastic. I wonder what this person would think about my decorations. I'm being too rough with my garland, it's going to scratch the walls. What if this person sees how I'm doing this right now, they wouldn't like it. I should do this the best possible way. I don't have enough decorations - but I actually have too many, I should buy more, no I should thrift more, no I should wait to accumulate them slowly over the years, I'm using batteries which will lead to more trash, I'm being too ""consumerism"", I should mop the floor, but what if my cleaning solution leaves a residue and hurts my dog, what's the most optimal schedule of floor mopping"" etc etc etc. I always circle to specific people in my life and what they would think of my choices, as if I'm being watched and scrutinized constantly. It's like I'm searching for all the potential mistakes I could make, and ways to avoid them or explain to people why I chose to do things a certain way. 

I don't know why I'm so terrified of doing something wrong, and people seeing. It makes me feel like I'm so self-absorbed, when really I don't want attention, I just want to peacefully exist among people and chill out, and discuss hobbies and just have a good time. I want to speak my mind, without automatically filtering myself based on how I want the other person to think of me. It feels so fake to be like this.

I feel like my friendships start off strong where we will come up with things to do together, places to go, but they lack the closeness of just being able to come to each others house to hang out and for that to be good enough. It always feels like it has to be out and about, spending money(which isn’t super sustainable for me rn, especially if I do it with multiple friends).

It seems that if we hang out at one of our houses, it’s awkward and just us talking which I sense that my friends are sick of and I wish that we could just do things in the house together.

It makes it tough since I still live at home with my parents as do my other friends. But in my situation my family isn’t very welcoming so we would be secluded to just my space.

Anyway overall with the friends I’ve had I feel like we just talk the whole time instead of actually engage in fun, genuine activity. And the conversation can feel a bit forced too since we normally just talk about what we are going through etc. which is fine but I used to be close with these friends and now I feel them drifting away and I feel like that is due to us having such intense conversations when we are 1 on 1. Or conversations where we maybe don’t catch up enough if we see each other with some others.

But it would also be nice to know how you keep up with your friends over text because I don’t do that too too much either like maybe once or twice a month, just not sure how to get out of the pattern of just “Hey, how have you been doing?”.

I’ve just been striving for a more authentic, less forced relationship for so long and I feel like I’m too awkward to be myself and have a normal friendship.

I’ve been friends with these people for 2-3 years now and I thought it would eventually get better and we would get close enough where it wouldn’t feel so scary and awkward every time we hang out. Now we just hang out briefly, catch up on the surface and then don’t text until next time.

Every friendship that I’ve had that was a bit more successful seemed to be because I was lucky enough to find friends who led the friendship more and seemed to have a lot more experience and made it comfortable right away But I don’t know how to just be fully myself and get us talking about our interests or doing fun things together rather than just analyzing our problems.

And also when I walk I really don't like getting even close to someone,I will either walk too fast and move forward or literally will stop there for some seconds and will start walking, I don't like if my purse or anything is touched or I touch mistakenly also since the road is crowded maybe it's normal, I do everything to avoid people, I try to stay far from them so there's no chance of touching, it's like a war for me to go home from office,I watch series on my mobile to avoid people, I just look down and walk, sometimes I feel people can clearly see how nervous and uncomfortable I'm while walking, if I see someone I get so much nervous I forget how to walk then in mind I have to say just keep moving legs,even I can't cross roads, I had one accident when I was 10 years old, so now I really can't cross I haven't forget that and actually no one ever taught me also but I have learnt it, it's not like idk how to cross the road but I just can't, I get afraid and it's just too hard for me.

1pdflpt,How to start conversations with people if you have social anxiety?,"Bruh, why am I so scared to talk to this girl? She’s an introvert, has no friends, and she kinda doesn’t give a shit who talks to her. But she keeps staring at me and looking at me since school started, and I’m scared she won’t talk to me. But what I have noticed is she seems to be trying to get close to me on walks, and I do as well. But both of us being introverted and shy is a bad mix.

Like bro, I go beside her last week on a walk on Monday, said “How are you?” and it came out so bad she didn’t hear me and just saw me looking at her. I hate how I built up enough confidence just for that to happen. We just stared at each other, then I looked away, then she did. Like bruh.

I think at this point it’s time to just say fuck it and talk to her. The worst that can happen is she doesn’t care. If she doesn’t care or acts like she doesn’t and continues staring at me, I’mma just ask why at that point. Like damn. She is really pretty — black hair, a bit tanned — but damn. I don’t know why she likes me, probably because I barely talk to anyone and I’m introverted.

By the way, at the end of the school day I walked beside her because we were going the same way. She started going behind me and I kept kinda looking at her, then it was too late to talk to her since my friends were there waiting for their parents.

Other signs she likes me: she’s staring at me, looked at me like 10 times in a day. When I came into the art room, she looked at me. When I’m talking to teachers, she looks at me. In the computer room, she looks at me because I’m kinda to her right across the room. One time I was talking to the teacher and she was looking at me, and I could see her looking at me, so I started smiling and getting uncomfortable since she was looking at me. I can’t hold eye contact with teachers or other people for long, and then her looking at me behind the teacher… bro. Then I kinda kept looking, then I got very anxious. I get anxiety in public places and when I’m not with a friend, and this doesn’t help since I think for a long time before talking to people or starting a conversation. People normally come up to me because I'm chill, but damn, when she looks at me my heart just starts racing.

Another reason she might like me: she got a friend she was with to ask me to talk on the phone. I was like “why?” So I said hi, then she giggled and was like “hi,” then I was like “they making fun of me.” That was last school year.

1pdetkf,dealing with social anxiety and looking for help,"I’ve been struggling with social anxiety for a long time, but I never talked about it because no one around me seemed to deal with the same things. I thought I was just overreacting. Now that I’m getting closer to turning 18, thinking about college, getting a job, and preparing for the future.. the anxiety has gotten worse, and I’m genuinely worried about how I’ll manage.

I’ve been physically abused throughout my childhood and even now it still happens sometimes, though it’s mostly verbal abuse. I’ve also been bullied for years. I recently learned that past trauma can play a big role in developing social anxiety, and it makes a lot of sense because I’ve become extremely unsocial. I do have friends, but I only see them at school. I don’t hang out with anyone outside of that, and I basically spent this whole summer at home without going anywhere.

I constantly feel like people are judging me. Being at school is uncomfortable, especially during lunch. If someone looks at me, I immediately assume they’re judging me, and I lose my appetite. There were times when my friends literally had to cover me while I ate or check if someone was looking just so I could feel a little safer, but even that didn’t really help.

Public places are hard for me. I hate being in public, and I can’t bring myself to use public transportation alone, go to the mall alone, or do basic everyday things that most people don’t even think about. It feels overwhelming and exhausting.

I had my first therapy session this Monday, and I’ve already scheduled another one for next week. It honestly felt good to finally talk about everything and let it out. But therapy is expensive, and I don’t think I’ll be able to afford it long-term. Realistically, I can maybe manage around 10 sessions. I’m also planning to see a psychotherapist once my spot opens up, since the waiting line was about three months.

In terms of social anxiety, I think I've massively improved from where I was just a few years ago, but I'm still quiet, and I don't think that part of me will ever change. I still hate how people are patronizing and look at you like you're dumber or something just because I don't open my trap as much as others do. Many of us have rich inner worlds and are just hesitant/anxious to share it with anyone else, thank you very much. It just makes me feel like an alien or something.

The quote in the title was said to me yesterday by a substitute teacher. I'm a senior in high school.

""You can teach your sister how to work the register, and she can teach you how to talk!"" (said to me by my boss.)

""She talks!?"" (YES AND YOU NEED TO DO LESS OF IT)

1pd1tvl,How do I stop ruminating after painfully awkward social interactions?,"For context, I've had pretty bad social anxiety since about 13 years old. It's gotten worse and better throughout periods of my life but never fully goes away. Right now I'm 23 and I've made a lot of progress in rebuilding my window of tolerance. Most days I mainly just struggle with overthinking. Worrying that I'm a fraud, not good enough, annoying, soaking up others personalities around me to make up for not having my own. 

Now that I have a few friends, I have some days where I feel completely inept at socializing. Like I forgot how to be a human being. My face heats up and I feel instantly embarrassed when someone talks to me. It's worse with work friends because I have to see them nearly every day, even on the days when I feel like a shell of a person. The more I fumble in my interactions with them, the more I ruminate on it. It fuels my anxiety and makes me fumble even more. I constantly have the urge to apologize for making things so uncomfortable, or explain that I've been feeling off. I'll replay the interaction for days or weeks afterwards cursing myself for being so alien. 

I just feel so inferior to them all. Like they've figured out how to be a whole person and I'm just trailing after them stumbling along. It's so much worse when I get to the level of friendship when we greet hello and goodbye with a hug or a dap. I constantly fuck up somehow and create a super obvious awkward situation. It's like my hand eye coordination and spatial awareness completely evaporate when I'm nervous. I'm pretty open about my mental health with friends, even new ones, so we've talked about anxiety, depression, cptsd, etc. Even so, I just keep wondering if they're as uncomfortable as I am. If it's contagious?? I feel so guilty and frustrated. I just want to have normal interactions and feel comfortable enough around people to build close loving friendships. I really value meaningful deep connections and it feels so impossible to obtain when I'm like this. 

I don't know what the solution is, but I wonder if I could just stop ruminating on my awkwardness then maybe it would stop the vicious cycle before my anxiety deepens. Does anyone relate?

1pd1ftp,Huge improvement after quitting nicotine,"Hey all. Just wanted to share this with you as I’ve come to a huge revelation and I can’t quite believe what I’m experiencing. 

I’ve had social anxiety since I was 10/11, and I’m now 21. Mostly stemming from self esteem issues at the root of it, and also bad experiences at school. Hugely socially awkward, get flustered and bright red when attention is on me in social situations, internally feels like I’m in a fight or flight response when trying to uphold a conversation with someone I’m not fully comfortable with (so basically everyone bar a few people). But in the last few years since I’ve grown into an adult I’ve also gotten quite the knack for masking it to try and look atleast somewhat normal on the outside.

Anyway, I’ve been a heavy nicotine user for around 4 years solid daily. Started off smoking, then went to vaping then in the last month of my nicotine consumption I switched to Zyns. 

Randomly on a whim I quit Cold Turkey 2 weeks ago, and somehow managed to stick to it, and my Lord it’s a completely new world to me. I can still feel I have social anxiety but it feels genuinely 10x smaller and in the back of my mind. Quitting has genuinely transformed the state of my mental health. My depression and lethargy have massively improved, by the end of week 1 I was just walking around at my job absolutely buzzing with life just happy to be me. I started looking after myself properly, keeping my room tidy and keeping on top of laundry, self hygiene better. And I feel so much more confident. My self esteem is through the roof. Not in a cheesy way, but for the first time in a long time I’ve held a positive image of myself in my mind *for a sustained period*. That’s the key to it for me I think, the self esteem issues were a large root cause to my issues and for some reason quitting has helped that immensely.

So if you have social anxiety and were considering quitting nicotine, please take this as your sign to quit. I thought it would be wayyyyy harder than it is. First few days it was all I could think about but after that it’s pretty easy. The main thing for me has just been identifying and calling out the random day to day cravings for what they are, environmental factors from the past that trigger your mind into thinking it’s nicotine time. Remind yourself of that, and keep a negative image of nicotine in your mind when you think about smoking again etc and it’s really manageable.

I know it’s only been 2 weeks but this has genuinely changed my life. Just wanted to share and potentially inspire someone else to try it out!",1764760360.0,socialanxiety

1pcwoyr,How does medication feel when it’s helping social anxiety?,"Feel like I have some form of social anxiety alongside my ADHD, Depression, and some very mild autism. I don’t get any physical anxiety symptoms when talking to people or anything, but I just always feel slightly awkward when talking to others. Part of it is because I feel like 80% of the time I’m just not too invested in what the other person is saying and it feels like I‘m faking my reactions and responses all the time bc I don’t really care about the topic. I wish I did care about it but idk something there is just off for me. I think part of it is just I care too much what others think and wish I could turn it off like a light switch but it just doesn’t work that way. After most conversations I always think “I should have done this“, “I should have made a joke”, “I should have been more playful and lighthearted”, etc. 

Frustratingly the only thing I feel like that has helped me socially is alcohol. It just makes me feel more sure of myself, not feel as self conscious, I’m more outgoing and extroverted, less serious and more talkative, I feel like I know what to say to keep a conversation going, it helps me truly not caring much about what other people think about me, and I actually am generally 100% interested in what other people are talking which rarely happens sober. It makes all the things I wish I could do during conversations just happen automatically. It all becomes natural and easy like it should be. The problem is I obviously can’t rely on this in everyday life or for every social situation bc that’s an easy road towards addiction.

I have tried a variety of antidepressants, stimulants, and anxiety medications for my mental health issues such as prozac, zoloft, auvelity, wellbutrin, ketamine therapy, TMS, adderall, vyvanse, ritalin, concerta, intuniv, strattera, buspar, metadate, focalin, dexedrine, and more but none of them have had any real affect at all on my social anxiety, let alone the way alcohol does. I’m not sure if maybe my expectations are just off about how medications are supposed to act on social anxiety, but I always assumed they would be like the effects of drinking alcohol but instead of taking 30min to kick in it’ll be 6-8 weeks for it to fully kick in. Obviously you wouldn’t get the drunk “everything is super fun and life is so wonderful” feeling but I thought they would have the social benefits listed above or atleast some moderate noticeable change to any of those aspects.

Maybe medications just didn’t work for me but for those who take medication for your social anxiety, how does it affect your social anxiety and what does it feel like? Is it just treating the physical anxiety symptoms that arise when in a social situation (panic attacks, nausea, etc) or is it like alcohol where it loosens you up, everything is natural, and is noticeable when it’s working?",1764742584.0,socialanxiety

1pcqh63,I think my social anxiety is turning to paranoia,"Just wanna see if anyone can relate I guess, and what I could do about it?

It's been gradually getting worse, I've been growing more and more secretive (especially around strangers and my (online) boyfriend) whereas before I was an open book.

As an example, there's a christmas thingy going on in a discord server I'm in and they ask a question each day for us to socialise and share together. Today was the first question and it asks what our best christmas memory is.

The way I started thinking things like ""why do they need to know that"", ""I shouldn't share that"", ""it's none of their business"", ""what can they do with this information"", ""I should keep it secret"".

I don't know why, I just feel like I shouldn't share things like that, like it's some sort of precious thing that I need to keep to myself, and I'm also scared of what all the random people in that server can potentially do with that information, even though I can't really think of anything.

It's weird because even when I already had bad social anxiety, I never had a problem with sharing things like that, I actually loved talking about myself online because it was the only way to socialise that I had. I miss it.",1764724273.0,socialanxiety

1pcota3,Why am I so rude & how do I stop?,"I’m spiraling. Please tell me if what I did is as bad as I think it was. 

Went to Target by myself with the intention of buying something which is a big deal for me being that I hate checking out and am also really anxious when out by myself. Lucky for me the self-checkout was dead when I got there. 
Anyway, I chose to go to one of the self-checkouts closer to the guy who was overseeing them and on my way there we made eye contact and he greeted me and said “how are you”. I said im good and asked how he was back, and then he casually went on to tell me that he was there until 8:30 and stuff like that. I’m not sure what to do when people actually start talking about themselves or anything like that when you ask how they are. Or if they just start talking about it even if you didn’t ask anything lol. Asking “how are you” is just a courtesy thing to me like If I didn’t ask it back I’d be rude asf. I also just feel uncomfortable speaking with strangers, especially with other strangers around. I ended up saying “oh really? Wow.” And continued paying for my things💀I realized how terribly rude it sounded a second after saying it and wanted to die. It was mostly cuz I just didn’t know what to say and I was stressed about being in public😭what made it worse was that he was handicap and seemed rlly sweet. Like he was just trying to chat cuz he was bored there cuz it was dead😭When I left I did smile and say “thank you” and he said “have a good day” and I said “thanks, you too”. Not that it makes up for my dryness..

This isn’t the first time i’m rude to someone who tries to small talk either. I just feel really uncomfortable and insecure talking to strangers and I think I put up my guard rlly quick. This has been the hardest thing for me, more so than actually going into places. The whole thing made me want to stop trying exposure therapy all-together cuz I felt like an asshole.

1pcnoku,How do you guys get yourself to be included again?,"Hi everyone! I’m new to this community on Reddit, and I was looking for some advice.

To give some background, I moved to a new school in 8th grade and started high school in a super small town where everyone already knew eachother. I struggled a lot making friends that want to actually get to know me outside of school, but I did make one really good friend group.

  
Last year, one of my friends (that had a crush on me, I politely said I wanted to stay friends and he said he was FINE with that) got a new girlfriend. I didn’t care and I didn’t know her that well, but I always tried to include her (she would always decline group hangouts). Turns out he thought I was trash talking his girlfriend, when I was venting to my friend that I was sad he started ignoring me.

He sent me a really mean spirited text and when I responded with an apology, he left me on delivered.

Cut to this year, my senior year, he’s suddenly back in the friend group despite blaming multiple of us for trash talking his relationship.

  
Suddenly that entire friend group has been going to parties and hanging out without me. It’s weird to me that they wouldnt just call me and ask since Indont have any classes with them. This group has a history of stopping inviting people that did something wrong instead of confronting them.

I’ve been really lonely this year, and basically have no close friends. I don’t have any classes with the people I used to hangout with. The loneliness has gotten really bad, and I’ve just been feeling worthless and hopeless. I’m scared to ask them about it, or tell them that I’m feeling left out. I don’t want to annoy them.  


Should I just ask if they’re avoiding me? Should I just give up and accept that it’s senior year, and everyone doesn’t need more friends?",1764717003.0,socialanxiety

It was my second day at a new place. I met this person who talked with me. We had the same sessions with lunch in between. 

I thought they would leave me alone and go off on their own.

Wrong.

This person stuck to me like glue. Even through lunch. I told them that they didn’t have to hang out with me but they said it’s fine and kept hanging out with me. I didn’t tell them to leave me alone because I thought they would leave me. It was annoying.

I did go up to them I think after I went to check something but that’s because I felt guilty if I felt like I ditched them. I think I did then say they didn’t have to hang out with me but they said it’s fine and stuck to me.

I can’t remember if they asked if they could stick with me but I might have said yes but only because I thought they would leave me after our next shared session.

They asked for my social media even though they only stuck with me for only like 4 hours.

Edit : And before our final session I said again they didn’t have to hang out with me. I can’t remember what they said but it was to the effect something like ‘you don’t want to hang out with me’ in a weird tone so I just let them stick with me. 

It was only one day but still. I never saw them two days after that. 

It was a new big place and they were so clingy I got anxiety they were going to come looking for me. I had no clue what to do if they did. A relative told me if they say hi reply hi back and then leave them without a word.

1pch32y,"13 Years of Social Anxiety Hell: Bullied, Isolated, and My Family Won't Let Me Get Mental Health Help. Now 26 and Terrified of Starting a Job","I'm 26 now, and I feel like I've completely given up on dealing with people. I don't think I'll ever rebuild my social skills at this point. They've just been eroding away year after year. I wanted to share my story here because maybe someone can relate or give advice. It's a long one, but I'll try to keep it organized. TL;DR at the bottom.

It all started when I was 13 and moved to a new school. That's when my social anxiety really kicked in. I never made any friends there at all. Instead, I got bullied constantly, which spiraled into deep depression and self-hatred. People in my class would joke that no one even knew I existed; they even gave me the nickname ""walking dead."" The bullying and constant disrespect made everything worse, and I struggled to form any connections. It felt like I was invisible, and it crushed me.

Fast forward 13 years, and at 26, I'm still losing whatever social skills I had left. I don't know how to interact with people anymore, and it's terrifying. Every year, I've tried telling my mom how my social anxiety is fueling my depression and that I desperately need help. Like counseling or therapy. But we're in a third-world country where mental health is a huge taboo. She's totally against it and fights me every time. Instead of addressing the real issue, she blames it on my physical health problems (I have eczema and asthma). She'd drag me to a pulmonologist for asthma or a dermatologist for eczema and tell them my ""mental problems"" are just side effects of those conditions. Which they're not.

She's done everything to block me from getting mental health support. At 16, I convinced my dad to book a counselor appointment and basically force my mom to come along. The counselor talked to me and suggested speaking with her, but she ignored everything he said. On the way home, she trashed him, calling him ugly and accusing him of manipulating me for money. She never let me go back. Then at 17, I tried again. She called all our relatives, and they bombarded me with calls telling me not to pursue counseling. In our culture, respecting your mom's word is a big deal, and I'm a pretty agreeable person, so I'd always back down and try to fix it myself. But I failed every single time.

As the years went on, my depression got worse, and so did my memory and concentration. I'd tell her about it, and she'd brush it off like, ""Oh, I feel that sometimes too."" COVID and our country's worst education system delayed things, so I didn't start university until 21. My mom insisted I go to one near home. No dorms or hostels, because she was scared I'd get distracted by ""other activities"" and ruin my studies. Even there, making friends was impossible; everyone else bonded in the hostels, while I commuted alone. I managed to sneak in a few counselor sessions on campus, but my mom monitored my schedule obsessively. Asking where I was, what classes I had. So I missed a lot. I got some medication for a few months, but free meds weren't always available, and my depression became uncontrollable. Somehow, I barely scraped through and finished my degree, but my memory is shot now.

At 26, things have hit rock bottom. My depression has killed my sexual interest entirely, with zero drive left. When I told my mom, she tried taking me to a urologist instead of a mental health pro. She even argued with the doctor when he suggested seeing a psychologist. Recently, after chatting with an AI, I realized I might have inattentive ADHD on top of everything, which could explain the memory and focus issues.

I'm planning to start a job next year, but I'm scared out of my mind. How do I even function in a workplace like this? I feel stuck and don't know what to do anymore. Has anyone dealt with family blocking mental health help, especially in cultures where it's taboo? Any advice on building social skills as an adult or managing this without family support?

TL;DR: Social anxiety since 13 led to bullying, isolation, and depression. Family (especially mom) blocks all attempts at counseling due to cultural taboos. Now 26, depression worsening (memory issues, no sexual interest), possible ADHD, terrified of starting a job. Need advice on getting help independently.",1764701903.0,socialanxiety

There were no one to hear me. No one to support me. The world around me was so threatening, that I'd rather find reason NOT to talk with people ever. I went nihilistic. Trying to make everyone around me a bigot. By making the society hipocrytical, I felt less need in socialising. Or so I thought

With time I found the special person that I could be open. She accepted me, all of my strange things. And I accepted her. But she changed. And so did I. She felt like I have no place in her life anymore

She ghosted me. It was painful. So painful, that I got rejection trauma fueling my social anxiety even more

Time goes on. I found a way to channel my feelings. I started to write poems. I shared it online. I found friends. The real ones. It was painful journey, but in the end I have someone with me. So I don't feel so lonely anymore. We all share the love for TTRPG

Though I haven't beaten my anxiety, I get better. Yes, I still can't make a phone call in my 21. But I can do things I couldn't for my entire life

1pbqrk2,how to streamline thoughts with my functioning? anxiety is inhibiting memory and coordination,"i’m not sure i’m using the right phrasing for this, but i’ll elaborate. 

i’ve had social anxiety since i was in 6th grade and whenever i get any amount of anxiety triggered over anything(which is about 50% of the time), my brain struggles to coherently function. a wrench is thrown into tasks that are muscle memory. even basic, built in tasks like communicating become much harder to “streamline”: instead of inherently knowing what i want to say and verbalizing it in a streamlined fashion, i struggle with hitting basic sentence beats and sometimes even remembering where in the conversation i’m at and what im trying to explain. this is just one example, but it makes me hardly functional in a handful of things when i know im capable of performing those tasks. i’ve joked to my therapist that sometimes i wish i had a lobotomy so that the buffer between overthinking and actions is eliminated- basically that meme of “no thoughts, head empty” except i mean it literally. if my ruminating, overthinking, compounding thoughts didn’t exist, i could just do basic tasks like every other person can. i don’t even know if other people with anxiety and social anxiety are this bad at functioning. sometimes im so dysfunctional i genuinely think i have damage to my brain, because there’s no way someone consistently and constantly forgets how to verbalize properly, right?

basically my question is: does anybody experience this and HOW DO YOU STOP THE WRENCH FROM BEING THROWN IN? are there any specific medications or combination of things that have worked for anybody else when it comes to how memory, coordination, and anxiety interact?  

a little more context: i’ve been on lexapro for a few years, started buspirone at the beginning of the year, and am juggling adhd meds which are a more recent thing. lexapro has definitely improved the streamlining by a little bit, but i’m still having constant difficulties 💔",1764627594.0,socialanxiety

1pbndio,story time - hated for being socially anxious?,"i’m coming to the realization of how easily socially anxious or shy people are labeled as rude, dismissive, or cold just because we’re quiet. loud people are seen as confident, and the quietest people are seen as a problem because we don’t preform how society wants us to 

i’m wondering if anybody has experienced something like this. i’m an AROTC MS3 and in my school’s program at the end of the semester we do peer evaluations. you rank everyone in the class from best to worst based on their overall performance / attitude as a cadet, and write comments about your top 3 and bottom 3 explaining why you ranked them there.

i’m a very reserved, quiet, and socially anxious person. it takes a lot for me to open up to people. i’ve managed to make some friends non the less because i try to be as helpful, caring, and empathetic as i can to everyone. the people i’ve personally talked to said they ranked me high in the peer evaluations. i’ve had people tell me very nice things such as they trust me and they look up to me as a cadet. i assumed i would rank around in the middle because i’m quiet and don’t know a lot of people, but the people who do know me really seem to like me. 

i was correct. i ranked 28/57, exactly in the middle. i was happy about that, until we moved onto the comments… i had one bad comment. my jaw dropped as i was read a paragraph of the most detailed and personal attack on my character and existence as a human. they said when people talk to me i’m dismissive, rude, hostile, and that i create tension for no reason. i was in such disbelief that i literally couldn’t speak. it took me a few minutes just to process what i had heard, and i kept trying to think of any reason someone would write something so hateful about me.

i eventually came to the realization that a lot of people see shy and reserved people dismissive. it doesn’t help that my voice is also very monotone. i wish i wasn’t like this but i can’t help it, this is who i am. my theory is that this was not written by somebody who truly knows me. i just find it so interesting how differently people can perceive the same interactions. there is not one person in the entire program that i have disliked, felt annoyed by, or ever thought negatively of. knowing that there’s somebody in my class who hates my guts makes me so sad, i really want to figure out who it is just to prove to them that i’m a nice person. anyways that’s my story! i’m curious if anybody else has had strange hatreds / misconceptions about them just because they are quiet. great end the the semester! 💀",1764619823.0,socialanxiety

1pbmad4,Is this about rejection or something else?,"This weekend, I posted in a discord server that I was ""a little bummed and disillusioned"" because I didn't get a response I had been hoping for to something I made and that I was less sure about doing something else because of that. I was hoping for comfort and encouragement from other members, but I was nervous because it felt vulnerable so I stayed away from the server for a few hours to distract myself. When I finally looked, the first response to me made it sound like I was acting entitled by being sad. I felt like I was being publicly shamed. I made a defensive reply, didn't read anything else people had said, and muted the server. I haven't been able to look at it since. For all I know, that was the only jerk, but I needed to calm myself down and now it's been so long, I feel it would be disruptive to respond to anyone else even to thank them for kind words because the way Discord works would drag the convo to the forefront again. But also maybe other people thought there was something wrong with me being a little bummed, too.

It's a shame because while I didn't have friends on the server and it always seemed a little cliquey, I thought of it as a place with kindred spirits and now I've cut myself off from it. I feel like this is typical behavior for me. I just don't know if I should be looking for advice on dealing with shame, rejection, or just general social anxiety.",1764617378.0,socialanxiety
1pblilj,Can a man ever change without losing who he is?,"I have had this internal struggle for a long time. There are a few characteristics of mine that I feel are quite different from others. This gives me quite a few strengths and a few significant weaknesses too. I am always afraid of changing myself. My thought process is that if I change myself, I would become someone else who is not my true self. Due to this, I am always hesitant to change myself. 

To give a bit of background about myself. I am 25M. I am a very introverted person. I generally keep everything to myself. But I am quite good at observing everything, finding patterns and always curious to know about all the stuff. This took me distance and made me who I am today. But it came with a big disadvantage. I always took time to trust new people. It always takes time for me to connect to a person and trust them. This made me very bad at small talk and forming new bonds. Whenever I tried to be more extroverted, it always felt like I am faking it and not being my true self.

At this point, I want to change but not by destroying my true self. Has anyone else struggled with these thoughts? I need some genuine advice.",1764615692.0,socialanxiety

Currently, I live in my hometown very close to my parents, and only a couple hours away from my old community with most of my friends, colleagues, and other connections.

Even though I’m in my late 30s, I’ve never lived more than a few hours’ drive away from my parents/hometown, and I’m both excited and worried about moving so far away - mostly because I can get incredibly lonely and the thought of being in a big city by myself is worrying. I need more freedom from my parents/family, but I also have anxiety about regressing into a super-isolated depression while I try to make new friends (not really sure it’s possible at my age).

1pbjpln,my social anxiety (at present),"so, I thought i'd give an update on my situation & just see if anyone feels similar or can relate, as at the moment even i'm not sure how to proceed moving forwards or process things. 

for context, I was on citalopram for 6 weeks, then came off it kind of cold turkey, & it's been about 2/3 since that. 

so, last night I ventured out to see my friend at the pub, we had a good catch up, & I was mostly fine (ish) I enjoyed chatting, & felt fairly comfortable.

however, he had to leave earlier than me as he was driving back to wales, I stayed on my own to finish my drink & that's where my anxiety shows & reminds me I definitely have it.

so I tend to just feel a bit awkward & wooden, almost like a spare part so to speak, I say to myself over & over ""just relax, chill out & enjoy your own company"" but it is always a challenge. I went to order another drink from the bar & even doing that I felt off. I eventually drove home & found myself super tired, even though I only woke up that day around 2pm! it's all such a surreal feeling, on one hand, i'm grateful that i'm able to get out & meet a friend etc, but on the other hand I know i've completely got an social anxiety problem, it affects my whole being, my personality, confidence, everything.

i'm not able to just enjoy being present anymore & always feel a bit awkward, I don't know if other people even realise it but in my own head it's 100% an ongoing problem.

can other people relate?

1pbdoni,Body shaking - experiences,"Hi, I don’t speak English, so I’m sorry for any spelling mistakes. I’m 24 years old and I’ve suffered from social anxiety since childhood. I receive a disability pension and I work at a reception desk, so financially I’m taken care of. But I don’t want this to be the end of everything. I want to get treatment and move forward.

However, more than the fear of human interaction itself, I’m terrified of something else a thousand times more: that I will start shaking… my hands, head, legs, my whole body! It limits me so much. It’s hell. For example, when I go to the cinema, I can’t even buy popcorn because I shake so much when paying. In general, paying for things is my nightmare.

When I’m in the kitchen and someone comes in who watches or judges what I’m cooking or baking, I start shaking too. The same happens when I count money at work. Visiting the dentist is also a nightmare. I can’t even drink from the cup to rinse my mouth.

Four days ago, I started taking 50 mg of Sertraline. I’d like to try therapy eventually, but later, because Christmas and the dentist are expensive, and at the moment I wouldn’t be able to save anything if I started therapy too. I just want to know if any of you have personal experience with reducing body tremors or even getting rid of them completely. It’s truly destroying my whole life.

The worst part of all this is that I actually have potential. I’m really capable and I want to work  but the shaking has prevented me from doing many jobs. My general practitioner refused to prescribe Propranolol because of my low blood pressure. :(

I also have to add that I shake even in front of my friends, my own grandfather, my brother… even though they’re family. But for some reason, my brain sees everyone as a predator.

I've only come to terms with this recently; all my life, I thought I was simply shy. I never knew I would fall this deeply. I find social interaction challenging, and I no longer enjoy it as much as I used to. I saw old videos I used to film on my LeapPad Ultra, and it was like a completely different person; it was so far removed from who I am now.  Even speaking to family members has got me feeling anxious, and I know it shouldn't, but I feel like a disappointment. I am 19 years old, and I have never had a job. I could never land an interview because I get nervous and stutter even on the phone. I never had any friends in high school because I took online school during the first year due to COVID, and I never got accustomed to the new environment when I went back to in-person school. Everyone had someone, so I kept to myself. This affected me throughout my entire life. I am in my second year of college and still have no friends. My life consists of doing schoolwork, playing mobile video games, and then sleeping. I know I have it better than most people; I can focus on school work without worrying about managing time with a job. But I don't want to stay like this forever. I want friends, even if I'll never be seen as a best friend, even if we're just class friends. I want a job, but I can't land an interview because of my social anxiety...

1pb19a5,I walked away from my bf and his family because I felt excluded,"My boyfriend asked me to come with him to see a cousin of his at college. Their culture is very close and social and he asked me multiple times to come. I told him I didn’t want to, but because he asked and I was trying to beat back against social anxiety, I decided to go.

I was very extremely nervous and those negative thoughts of rejection tried taking over, but I fought against them. I made myself envision the best, be ready to be open and show interest in her and the dynamic.

My bf told me that they would speak English so I didn’t feel excluded and that made me feel better. However, those two spoke 90- 95% of the time in their language although they’re both fluent in English and I don’t understand pretty much any of their language (it’s a very difficult language spoken by one country of a few million people- not well known). 

I still walked with them though and hoped for the best. My bf tried to include me in the convo and when I answered, his cousin just gave a little throwaway comment to appease the contribution, it seemed- like it wasn’t really something relevant or that she had or cared to have a response to- and proceeded to speak in their language with my bf again.

I was trying to walk in line with them, but my bf and his cousin did the infamous 3rd- wheeler treatment of walking in front of me while I ended up following them and trying to get back in the line. 

When his cousin saw her English speaking friends though, she immediately went to speaking English with them.

I looked at my bf and he was smiling and looked happy, his cousin and her friends appeared happy, and I just felt rejected again. Like I failed again.

So, I asked him for his car key. He was still smiling and focusing on the scene unfolding and said we were all going to the car. I asked him two more times for the key and he gave it to me completely engaged with the social stuff.

I sat in the car the remainder of the time. He texted asking me to please come with them and that his cousin’s bf was coming with them, was an English speaker, and and they would speak English. I respectfully declined, told him I was talking with family, and to enjoy himself and take his time.

I fought back tears in the car and wiped them when they came back about 30 minutes or more later.

He asked me why I was angry and I tried not to answer and just said I was glad he enjoyed the visit. He kept pressing for an answer so I broke down and told him how it felt. He was trying to be understanding but said that it was disrespectful to him and that they basically did the same thing with his cousin’s bf. He said his cousin was asking where I went.

I’m concerned I may have overreacted or been selfish about the whole thing. I just feel bad that I made a huge effort, felt excluded, and when he told me he was too shy to meet my family on this very same day… I didn’t pressure or ask him to. 

I think I have an additional problem with unconsciously expecting people to be as kind and inclusive as I would make an effort to be with people so they never feel how I felt in that situation. But, I rarely get the same treatment by others.

i am alive yes but not living. ever since graduating high school i've been sort of stuck. i go through periods of going to therapy and feeling optimistic about my future then being completely shut in my house just barely coping by playing video games and listening to music. i am in the latter period right now and it sucks because i feel like i've soft locked myself into an unfulfilling and meaningless existence 24/7. i'm stuck and i'm scared and i don't know where to start. even the tiniest of a baby step seems like freefalling off a cliff most times.

on better days i just tell myself that i'm doing the best i can right now. on bad days i can't help but feel like the biggest loser in the world who too scared of getting a job or going outside and is a leech on my family. making excuses for myself to stay in my comfort (safe) zone and be lazy all day. i'm not trying harder i'm not pushing myself enough i am on the ground and in the end i'll only have myself to blame if i die in this exact same spot i choose to turn a blind eye towards getting better so i can get a couple achievements in whatever game i'm using to distract myself in the moment. but. it's so much easier to do.

1pazjrq,some of my best tips/advice to help overcome social anxiety (as someone whos dealt with it severely),"im not here to sell anything i just wanna help whoever i can. first some backstory. when i was maybe 11-13, i was so quiet and anxious id often struggle to talk above a whisper. as in physically. id have one best friend who i would whisper everything to. i could barely even answer my name on the roll call, and more times than i can count someone else had to point me out to the teacher or answer for me.


now (at 18) i can go anywhere, talk to anyone, i talk to people i like, people i think seem cool, bartenders, servers, hosts of events, people ive never met before, i can (politely) ask for a messed up drink order to be fixed, i can talk into a microphone in front of a bar full of people. people semi regularly comment on how they envy that i can talk to anyone and not get nervous. and here are some things that helped me:


1. think of some people who really shouldnt be talking but they do anyway. maybe its a coworker whos just always being rude to people, and to top it off they speak at 5x a normal volume and dont stop talking and make it everyone elses problem. you have to listen to them, so you know what? you can make them (and whoever else) listen to you too, because youll still be more decent than them and have much more useful things to say (and even if other people dont agree, its really your own opinion that matters to a degree)


2. back yourself, no one else can speak for you, and you deserve support that only truly comes from yourself. even if you have someone in your life who sometimes does it, life is unpredictable and its so important you can advocate for yourself, it will improve your life SO much


3. nothing really matters that much, any one person’s experience is ultimately irrelevant. not in a mean way, in a comforting way. of course its not good for you to be upset or something, but at the end of the day if someones rude or rejects you or disagrees with you or finds something you say weird, there are like 8 billion people on earth, and it wont cause any major catastrophes or leave any real impact in time. even if it hurts, its not the end of the world


4. if you do accidentally embarrass yourself somehow and it spikes your social anxiety, think of how much worse it couldve been to frame it. if you accidentally knock over a drink (like i did the other day), fix it up, and then think “hey at least i didnt set the whole bar on fire”. it seems silly but it gives perspective to something that seems catastrophic, and makes you realise even if its not ideal, its also not completely terrible.


5. learn to assume people will like you, and dont bother with people who dont. this one takes a while and builds over time as you see more people who like you, but it gets to a point where if youve started chatting to 6 people at an event and they all get along well with you, and then one person gives you a weird look, youll be able to think “wow, whats their problem? everyone likes me” and then shrug it off and find people you get along with

6. think worst case scenario. unless someones physically dangerous in some way, really usually the most someone can do is be rude or unpleasant. which sucks, but then you just ignore them and try your best to carry on. you need to remind yourself that even though not ideal, you can survive an unpleasant interaction. also youd probably be surprised by the amount of people who are decent, its easy to think things will go badly, and then if you just never try, you’ll keep believing things will often go badly, when in actuality it’ll probably often be fine

1paz4rg,I wish silence was more socially accepted,"I realized that I love being with people when I don't feel pressured to talk to them. I don't even dislike small talk, it's just often too much and I hate that I feel pressured to participate in it

I feel like conversations irl go way too fast for me and they're so hard to navigate, I don't really have an interest in most things people talk about, I feel like most of my opinions aren't interesting enough to be worthy of sharing, and when I do feel curious or interested about something usually I miss the chance to talk about it because other people monopolize the conversation and change subjects very quickly. I don't blame them, I understand that some like chatting and/or get anxious about silence, and it's up to me to interrupt. But when there's no room for even a little bit of silence, it makes it so exhausting to follow conversations. If I don't isolate myself often I feel emotionally and mentally drained and can't focus anymore

Well, actually, she responds whenever she feels like it, which can be immediately or never. And even when she answers, it is likely that the chat will cut off at some point not far from the start because she will stop answering when the conversation is still open. 
Last time I tried to interact with her was the final straw. I commented on a story she posted complimenting her ""even though she doesn't reply to my messages"" and I said that adding an emoji so she knows ""I'm not mad anyway"". And I said this because she never responded to my previous messages in a conversation we were having. 
Again, she did not respond and it's been more than 24 hours now.
Should I send her to hell?

I am a little older than some of them, 1-2 years so I am hesitant to be the one to initiate anything because I am an adult while they are in high school.

Lately Ive been going out a lot by myself (two to three times a week), dancing at clubs, networking, making new friends, the works. It’s really upped my confidence and I’ve surprisingly had very little anxiety putting myself out like this after a year or two of pretty intense isolation. However as SOON as the idea of being around someone alone without the flashing lights of the club and the super loud music I literally cannot breathe. People meet me and see me as this cool outgoing person, but as soon as I’m alone I freeze up. Feels like I’m actually pulling teeth I hate it about myself so much. I can even have an anxiety filled day and feel okay to go out and drink and party , but as soon as someone asks if I want to meet up beforehand I instantly can’t handle it anymore.

I can do this, I just struggle to really make conversation because the people I feel anxious being around are not really people I want to talk to, and when I do it and tell my therapist she kind of acts like I'm making progress but in reality I'm just playing with my anxiety pointlessly and don't really understand the part where I talk to them without getting anxious?

1pag4f9,To the stranger who eased my social anxiety,"I am a highschool student currently taking steps to signing up to universities abroad.

So a few months ago, I had to take an IELTS test. I forgot my passport (which was required), which made me lose a lot of money for the test I missed. My mom scolded me in front of the other candidates in the room. The announcement echoed throughout the building, and everyone left to take the test. My mom quickly followed after, grumbling as she left the building.

Humiliated, I stood outside the English center alone, leaning against the wall while trying to calm myself. It was soon after that a middle-aged man approached me. He was smoking too near, and I hated cigarettes, but I put up with it because I didn't want to come off as unfriendly.

He asked me what happened, and I explained. He told me he was the father of one of the candidates and that his son was going to apply for a scholarship abroad. I replied I was on the same boat, and for the first time I managed to throw back words normally to a complete stranger. We had a nice conversation where he told me about his stories of working abroad.

It made me realise, was this really what I was afraid of this whole time? I am perfectly fine on my own after all. I needed no friend to speak on behalf of me.

The next days, I tried quipping in some words with strangers. ""What made you start a juice business?"" to the lady who owned the orange juice stand I often bought from. ""Your dog is so cute, what's his name?"" to my neighbor who walked the dog often. ""What books do you like reading?"" to the kid hanging in the public library. 

I still hesitate to speak sometimes, but exposure therapy worked way better than expected. Starting it may be like a leap of bravery, but man does it only get better.

1paeife,"I'm an introvert, but it hurts to be alone.","
I stopped studying after finishing high school, not by choice, but for other reasons.

The thing is, since then, I haven't had an environment where I can socialize, not even a course or any other place where a teenager / Young adult would normally spend his time socializing and meeting people.
Obviously, I tried to make friends online, and currently I have three good friends.

I even tried dating apps, but I didn't get a single match on any of them, not even those where everything is supposed to be slower or for ""shy"" people.

But sometimes the lack of physical interaction weighs heavily on me. I obviously talk to and see my family, but not people I consider friends or even romantic interests.

I had a long-distance relationship during those four years, but it eventually ended, and it made me miss that physical connection even more.

I'm already a very shy and introverted person; I might have had social anxiety (I'm even too shy to want to go to a psychologist and get diagnosed). But now, I'm 18 years old, and I feel like my entire youth has been wasted, and I don't know exactly when things will change. 

Every time I have to go outside, even if it's with my family, I get incredibly panicked. My stomach hurts, my hands sweat, and my mind races. Sometimes I just can't sleep thinking about ""that day"" or how much I wish ""that date"" would happen so I could go back to normal. 

The easiest answer would be ""Just go out and meet people like you,"" but my shyness, my insecurity, and the fact that I like being alone (even though it sounds contradictory), leave me feeling stuck, no matter what option I consider.

My family knows that a little, but they don't know how much this affects me. It's also difficult to manage when I also feel depressed sometimes, and especially with the pressure of deciding what to do now that I'm 18, it's huge. I don't know if I'm a burden to them, or if there's a magic job for people like me.

1padouj,I don't want friends,"This might just be a vent post LMAO. Apologies in advance if I sound like I'm just complaining. I am m17, almost turning 18, and have no driver's license, job, or friends. 2 years ago, I developed paranoia that inhibits me from forming relationships. I do not want people to get close to me. I am afraid of rejection, so ultimately, I avoid trying to connect altogether. The process of making friends is physically demanding and requires emotional stability. A bit of charisma can go a long way, but I am not charismatic. For me, actually trying ends in unnecessary tension, awkwardness, and discomfort for both people. And I realize that this is self-sabotaging because I tend to withdraw if I feel like I'm imposing on an established friend group when I haven't been invited. They see that I'm guarded because I anticipate rejection, and they understandably distance themselves from me. It is much easier to isolate yourself from others when all you've received is judgment and condescension (I recognize this is a very pessimistic way of thinking about it). A bit cringey, but there is no incentive for me to make friends.   
  
When my social anxiety was at its worst, I would never talk to people because I knew that if I did, then it was another opportunity for my classmates to tease or mock me for my stuttering. 

I constantly feel like a burden, and always feel like people have to tolerate me when I'm socializing. I'm so embarrassingly awkward that it makes it impossible for someone to like me.

  
Plus, not getting along with a person damages my reputation and theirs. Because if they do decide to befriend me, they've now just associated with an antisocial loser who can't provide value. The person you've talked to KNOWS you're weird and are more likely to make fun of you, though I could be projecting. Food for thought, but why would they WANT to talk to you? It's not like you're the only person. Millions of people are secure and capable of maintaining a healthy relationship that will uplift both parties.

I am a hikikomori (not Japanese). I have run out of all my moral and physical strength to keep running from reality and from my own thoughts. Reality has caught up with me, and I can’t hide from it anymore. Nothing brings me joy now — not social media, not books. Absolutely nothing. All I do to kill time is sleep all day, stare blankly at a screen, or lose myself in a dream that will never come true.

I have been living in this hell for more than ten years. I have never kissed anyone, never hugged anyone, never even held a girl’s hand. Sometimes I am burned by the thought that I will die a virgin and never know what love feels like. It’s excruciatingly painful and terrifying to realize how much time I’ve already wasted. I’m afraid to even look at the calendar. Social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder have trapped me within four walls, where I left my teenage years, my youth, my best years, my dreams, my health, and my friends. I also have OCD. I’ve lost myself. I ran from reality into the virtual world, and now my real life feels like a virtual one — just a pathetic imitation of life.

I don’t know how to live anymore. I have no survival skills, no communication skills. I ruined my health because of a sedentary lifestyle. I am a houseplant. My parents are already old, and I’m not young either. I’m almost 30, and I’m not even sure I’ll live to that age.

I hate the day I stayed home and played video games instead of going to school. Since then, I’ve barely gone outside. The internet became my refuge, my drug, my illusion of salvation. But reality always catches up with you. And you will suffer. You have to pay for everything sooner or later.

I’ve been able to go to concerts, huge wrestling events, and my career requires me to be social. The final boss for me has always been dancing.

Even when I was on dance or cheer teams when I was younger, that part was always really difficult. I used to think part of the problem was the genres of music I was trying to dance to. I went to a club once, and while everyone else was dancing, I just felt frozen and awkward. If I tried to do a dance move, it would barely last two seconds because it felt so unnatural. Maybe it was the newer hip-hop music, they weren’t the songs I felt comfortable moving to. I think dancing to older hip hop, r&b, Latin, or house genres might be easier for me… but honestly, it could just be that it was in public.

Recently, I’ve been fascinated by people who can just dance in clubs or open spaces, and I started thinking about what it would be like to do that at. I have a concert coming up with a house music DJ set, so I started watching videos from Soulection, Zack Fox sets, etc to see how people at those.

Today I got up and started emulating what I saw. My brain is very technical, so I can’t just move to the music, I need to see what it looks like to understand it. And honestly? It was so fun. I got a good workout and it actually brought me joy. I think I might start doing this regularly.

I also apologize if I articulate my thoughts badly and yall don’t understand what I say because I’m also in the dark about why this is happening 

Ok it started at around the previous grade, everyone took these extracurricular sports events me and those who did were exempt from coming to school

So I ended up going a semester and a half with literally just me alone in the lecture halls

Fast forward to now, I am in the first sem of 12th grade and I am js extremely paranoid of talking to people 

I don’t know why I feel this way, I’m pretty much close friends with everyone in my class and have a long history with them, but whenever they hangout or do something I’m just so afraid of going up and talking with them so I end up sitting in class all day and even they find it weird why I seclude myself and even I do too

Past few days I have been getting better but I still overthink like crazy about what I’m gonna say and if my opinions are even welcome and I dread coming to school because this cycle of worrying and feeling pressured that I’m not talking enough is really fucking draining at times 

I don’t know WHY this is happening I’m friends (school friends I should clarify I don’t hangout with them outside school)  with them but I’m js so nervous and it genuinely baffles how people can js go and say whatever’s on their minds, sorry if I’m unclear I don’t really know what’s going on either if I had to take my best guess on what’s wrong i think I might say lack of any self confidence and or overthinking.                       Edit:if yall know any in the moment tricks to relax and stop overthinking like meditation or something pls tell me ",1764442285.0,socialanxiety
1p9w41p,I just started college again and safe to say my social anxiety is going away,"It’s the end of the semester and of course I was a bit shy in one of my classes but but of course there is one who I never have a chance to talk to anyone since it’s only an hour and once a week and they’re kinda boring but then I along came a class where I got to talk to people 


I got really comfortable like a few months passed and they say and waved and I said hi like I even got the courage to talk to someone I liked and go up to them and start talking and it’s sometimes hard to do that for me yay and also I notice my old high school senior self is returning who was very social well o I have some friends still from before 


One off motivations or talk to my peers was “the only thing I will regret is not talking to them” “the reason why people don’t make friends is because they never even bother talking to them” “would it matter in 5,000 years?” So I’m like actually went up to people I’m interested in being friends with and yeah now I’m comfortable enough to even talk I mean yeah the semester is almost over it may not be the same people but still I am proud of myself , but I notice it’s easy for me to go up to someone who seems to be interested in me even asked for their socials ",1764441108.0,socialanxiety

I can’t be as outgoing as them",It really is hard to stay positive when the extroverts are the majority and they are so much better at talking and expressing themselves.

1p9tjeg,I think everyone hates me,"This started in covid years, I was at home  the time and I didn't speak to anyone, like none of my classmates unless I wanted notes from them and then we started offline classes and I realised that I have become very socially anxious. I started overthinking everything I said, sometimes what I thought of saying didn't come out the way I wanted or I would say the wrong thing without meaning to which led to so many awkward moments in high school eventually I just gave up talking and started reading  books in school. I

I was in two schools over the last 3 years of HS and I found some differences, in the first one that I was in during the shift from online to offline, despite the awkward moments, kids were largely very friendly I had good one on one convos with them just that when we were in a group they would just not hear me even after I repeated what I said, not respond to my texts in the class grp etc, I felt like a wall to them I don't  know if it was intentional or not coz I used to wear a mask and maybe they didn't hear me properly and I couldn't exactly open up with them either coz they had all kept in touch and had become this big grp and they couldn't match my interests either. I wasn't friends with anyone that year  but when I would have my lunch alone they would call me to sit with them, but  it was out of pity as when I sat with them, they would talk amongst themselves and not really care about me. 

In my second school, I thought I could have a fresh start bcoz the people in my class matched my wavength, but the people who were interested in the same things as me, like I found a grp and I thought we could be friends but one of the girls did not like me, she made it very obvious, she would give a blank stare or ignore things I said and only respond to the other girls and other people would be nice to me but the second someone they wanted to speak to would come, they would ignore me all of a sudden, and then there were people who were nice to me throughout but they were part of a big grp in school and didn't match my imterests either so again I ended up having no friends 

Some girls were nice to me in the beginning but towards the end of the year would start being cold to me and would be nice to me again during some days like Graduation day lol . One girl just took one look at me and just decided to look down whenever I said something and just didn't respond to me. It was very annoying I never had the courage to ask why they hate me coz in my memory I never did anything to them on purpose the hate was just for no reason and I was just scared to hear the actual reason.. It still bothers me sometimes 

I am meeting the same kind of people in college now and on some days like today I just feel everyone I come around just hates me, I am aware that it could just be that they aren't in the mood sometimes or I may be overthinking the blank stares I get but there are people who do this intentionally,but why always me?? I ust want to know if other people go through it as well and how did they get past it?

1p9nryb,Venting.. Advices are appreciated,"I am a 25 female. I have been battling with depression, social anxiety and anxiety all my life, ever since I can remember. I don't believe I was a happy child. I always wanted to be social and to have a free soul. I feel like that's what I am hiding under all my insecurities and problems. As a teenager, I always thought I would ""get over"" this mindset that I have. But it never happened. I went to therapy, doctors and I got advice from people. Nothing worked. I am still in therapy. I thought I was seeing the silver lining at the end but after a while, I am back in this shit place. I tried everything. I tried to be active, have a healthy life. I did yoga, I went to the gym, I meditated, I ate clean. I won't lie, the 'healthy' life actually made me feel better. But I could never get the pressure on my chest out. It's always there. Before I started my 'healing' journey, I thought that pressure on my chest was guilt. I thought I was experiencing guilt about being alive, doing what I wanted to do. It always felt like I needed to be living according to other people's rules. I became bitter and jealous of those who had 'free souls'. I hated pretty women. I hated my face. I hated everything about myself. I hated how I acted, how I walked, how I moved. I hated that I hated myself. I became insecure about people knowing my secret that I hated myself. I wanted to seem confident, care free, happy. Just like I always imagined. I've been in relationships where people took advantage of me. I wasn't treated right. But I stayed because I felt like I was a half life without a person. I became addicted to sharing my life with someone, and that person protecting me against all the evil of the world. I knew it wasn't realistic. I just hoped because it was easier than healing. I let myself go. Started doing drugs and become severely underweight. Started smoking, going to parties and being someone that I wasn't. I just wanted to fit in. I just wanted to feel how real peace felt. I abused drugs so much that it started becoming a problem. I left my boyfriend and his friends. It was the most toxic environment for me and I lived in it for a year. Then I started my 'healing' journey. Gained weight, stopped drugs, started the gym and painting. I met a guy online. He was different from everybody else. I immediately felt that we had a 'soul tie'. I believed we were meant together. He drained me. I just wanted to stay with him, I wanted to be with him and get married to him so I stayed. Whatever he did, I kept seeing  him. I blamed myself for every argument we had. For some reason, he wasn't leaving me as well. He was constantly mad at me and became really manipulative. He didn't leave until one day. That's when I learned he was in a relationship the whole time. Even though it felt like hell for a few months after he left, I felt so light afterwards. I started working hard so that I could study abroad. I believed it was going to solve all my problems. The funny thing is that I always did the same thing. I changed schools a few times, I wanted to be in a new place because I believed that I was going to forget everything and start clean. When I came to a whole new different country for my studies, I felt this adrenaline. I was hungry to meet people, have conversations. I couldn't believe what was happening. I wasn't overthinking about my interactions, I didn't have anxiety. I was so happy to be in a new country. A fresh, white, clean page. I met my now boyfriend. He is thoughtful, amazing. The best thing I could ask for. He cares for me and loves me. But after a while, I started being so insecure again. I believed I didn't deserve him and I wasn't enough for him. I started feeling like an ugly girlfriend next to a very handsome man. I started to struggle at school. I became so overwhelmed that it paralyzed me. I couldn't do anything. The stress of being in a new country and trying to settle made me feel even worse. I was just existing at this point. I started feeling disconnected from myself. I stopped seeing the new friends that I made. I felt more and more insecure as people and my boyfriend got to know me better as it made me feel more vulnerable. I wanted to take a step back and I did take a step back from friendships. But I felt too attached to my boyfriend again. Feeling like I couldn't breathe or do anything without him. I knew that was a problem. I constantly talked about my attachment issues with my therapist. But I am a bystander in my life. I watch as things happen. Because my fears outweigh my reason. I let them control me. Now I feel defeated. I am opening up to my boyfriend a lot more but I am terrified of him seeing the actual me. Which is this ugly, insecure girl. I am in the cycle of self sabotaging again. I know it and feel it coming stronger. But I am paralyzed. I don't know what to do. I am so tired of living. The fact that I will never unalive myself makes me feel more stuck. I can't believe I have to live through this. I feel so defeated. I am in an lovely country, have an amazing boyfriend, in a major that I like, I have a roof over my head. I am healthy and able-bodied. I have a supportive family. I can feed myself. As ungrateful as it is, I am not happy. And I feel like I will never be truly happy. What is happiness you might ask. I don't expect anything crazy. I just want to be confident in myself and be grateful for what I have. I don't know how. I don't know if there's any 'cure', 'solution' or anything that I already don't know but if you have anything to say, I'd appreciate it.

1p9kac6,So How Does One Know What's Going On Around Town?,"I'm 37, introverted, and tired of being basically a recluse. But I seriously have no idea how anyone knows whats going on around town so one can meet people. It almost feels like one of those catch 22s 'want to meet people, needs to know people to be invited to things to get to meet people.'

When you're in school things are different, you see the same people every day, you can overhear convos, hear people talking about get-togethers and such. But when you're an adult it's so dangerously easy to get caught in the grind of work, home, work, home and that's your life. I used to live with my mother and somehow she'd always know about events around town.. no idea.

I'm wondering (hoping) this is just a technology age-gap thing? But how in the world do any adults nowadays hear about events and meet ups around town aside from having people around you to outright tell you and invite you? : T",1764406646.0,socialanxiety

1p9ick2,Not wanting to go out with friends(vent),"So me and my “friends” have a gc. My friend, A, is in another state and comes back from the bar with some guys he knows. He then snaps a video of himself while pissing talking about how messed up the drinks got them and that we should go downtown in our city to go to a bar or club. 

Ofc, my two other friends, C and J, both agree bc they love going downtown. I genuinely hate going downtown. But now a bar or a club? No way! As I got older, when I go to place that I’m uncomfortable in and can’t escape or be alone for a while, I start to tense up and clench my hands. Man I wish I wasn’t like this…

But if I had better friends, I probably would be more comfortable. U see, A and especially J are always making fun of me, specially on how I look, which made me more self conscious about myself, more than before. A has always been an ass since elementary school. J is the worst tho. He’s so aggressive to me. C is cool tho. I really like hanging with him one to one. 

I’m basically stuck in this group. If I leave, I’m scared that I’m going to be alone and can’t make other friends. These are the only friends I have that are intermediate. I really don’t want to go downtown, especially at a bar with them.

I was a bit excited to go but when we got here, I have been perceiving things as slights. Like I said something earlier and someone scoffed so I just shut up. They also didn’t wait for me before they sang HBD to my husband and friend, bc I was unpacking so I missed a chunk of it. Also culture is a bit different. I just moved here and people don’t go out of their way to say hi and shit, so it makes me uncomfortable. But I also fear saying hi bc I don’t want them to start conversing with me bc when I do talk, the conversation just dies down or I stammer so I get scoffed or giggled at. If I don’t talk THEY’RE uncomfortable.

So now I’ve isolated myself in our room to “recover” by sulking lolol, but the problem is I’m the only one who isn’t there.

My husband keeps asking if I am ok and I say yes because I don’t wanna ruin his celebration by ranting or feeling bad for myself. I keep saying, “oh, I’m just tired” or “go ahead, I will follow”.

Is it okay if I’m just around other people but I don’t say anything? Kinda like for moral support for my husband? lol. I am not interested in drinking or whatever. 🫠

What also makes me sad is how old versions of me live in so many peoples heads- im in high school and i got bullied in freshman year because i was really socially inept, i loved so many people i met in my exploratory classes and shit but no one really gravitated towards me because i was so fuckin awkward. I kinda just got picked on and i didnt realize it at the time, like what little innocence i had was destroyed.

1p9d18j,Family gatherings put me in fight or flight  27F,"I went into the holiday season with the intention of tackling this fear head on and being more social at family gatherings. To give some context I went to my dads, we have a complex history of a strained relationship but I’ve made a point to work on the relationship because he is the only parent I have left, my mom died 9 years ago.  Needless to say my moms death added a layer to my already layered trauma and I’ve always been more of an introvert but I can be extroverted around the right people.

I pretty much talked to the kids because I feel like they’re the least judgmental and the easiest to talk to but I’m sure that makes me look weird.

Then I was finally diagnosed with Bipolar II. I was given Lamictal 3 months ago and the non-stop noise in my head has lessened significantly.

In the past when I’ve put my best effort into things I’ve been rewarded with abysmal failure. When I do nothing the same thing happens. I’ve accepted that this is the way I am due to this disorder and it will not get better. I’ve tried therapy, medications, exposure, supplements and many other things but none of it has ever worked consistently. I feel as though I should’ve died a long time ago and I’m living on stolen time. I don’t feel like my life is bad or good - I don’t feel like I’m living any kind of life. 

I spend every day in my room, smoking weed, doing the same thing over and over and over, being a dependent and needy man child who’s 25 years old and I still rely on my parents for everything. It’s 2 pm and I’ve spent the day so far lying down feeling sorry for myself and talking to chatgpt about my emotions. It’s pathetic. When I’ve tried to work, I was fired twice due to my employer stating my incompetence and anxiety. Even after my last employer made almost every accommodation and tried their best to support me, ultimately I couldn’t handle the stress of the job and was fired. Not told that I could voluntarily resign - as they had done for other coworkers - I was terminated

I don’t blame them for their decision as my performance from their perspective was abysmal. I was constantly shaking and couldn’t speak even simple sentences to clients. When I received the report the reasons for my termination were outlined in detail including what each of the people who were training me thought. When I had got this job I was so happy for once because I was doing something totally out of my comfort zone that required interacting with a lot of people. I thought I was personally progressing well as my training went on, and I was really proud of myself and felt something was finally changing. But reading the report, it looks like I was never made out for the job in the first place and I was never actually doing well from their perspective, they just wanted me to succeed I guess because they thought I was “nice.” That’s all that anyone has ever said about me. Oh he’s nice. They don’t know anything more than that. It’s like I don’t exist already. I feel like the only people who really care about me in the world are my parents, and it’s because they have to. They have a biological instinct to care for me.

My brain isn’t built for this world, I am too sensitive, and the world is too unfair and harsh of a place.

1p8zmpr,I embarrassed myself in class today and can’t stop overthinking it,"
I (18M) was sitting with my friend in class today. Then I decided to change my seat and go sit at the back. But the teacher saw me moving and told me to go sit ahead instead — which meant I had to walk all the way to the front and sit on the bench right behind my crush.

As I was walking forward, I felt like everyone was staring at me. My legs felt normal, but in my head I kept thinking I looked awkward or weird. When I sat down, I became super self-conscious about how I walked and how I sat.

I also think I heard someone say “kaise chalta hai woh,” but I don’t even know if I heard it right or if it was about me. It might’ve just been my anxiety filling in the blanks.

My crush usually looks back sometimes, but today when I sat down, she didn’t look back at all. My brain immediately went to: “She must think I’m ugly, stupid, or awkward,” even though she didn’t actually do anything negative.

Now I’m stuck overthinking everything.
I struggle with social anxiety, and whenever people look at me, I suddenly feel like I forget how to walk or act normally. Even though nothing physically felt wrong, my mind keeps telling me I embarrassed myself.

Is this just anxiety making me imagine the worst?
How do I stop assuming people dislike me based on moments like this?
Any advice would help.

1p8x4tq,My friends kept teasing my heritage and I’m scared I might’ve said something offensive by accident,"I’m 28F, half white and half Hispanic. My dad’s whole family is from Spain, Cuba, etc.

I went to my friend’s house for Thanksgiving yesterday and some people there kept making fun of me for how “white” I look and sound. My name is a Spanish name so that didn’t help either.

Socializing is hard enough for me so being teased in front of a group makes me panic inside. They made another joke about me, this time in the form of a question. I don’t remember what it was exactly but I think I said something like “yeah but I have that soul in me” referring to Hispanic soul. I don’t know why I said that because it doesn’t even make sense looking back on it. I was on auto pilot just trying so hard to be light hearted and funny to fit in after being made fun of all night.

Was that offensive? I thought about it later and realized “soul” might be more of a term for the Black community. But then I googled it and saw that Latin Soul is a thing, a type of music, however I identify more with Hispanic culture.

I just feel so bad now and I didn’t even ask for it, they wouldn’t stop and I didn’t want to seem like a stick in the mud for not “laughing” with them and their “jokes.”

A couple people cringed when I said it but I couldn’t tell if that was just them still making fun of my “whiteness” like they had all night. Also a family went home a couple minutes after and I’m worried they left because of me :(",1764342483.0,socialanxiety
1p8wx52,Seeking Advice on Overcoming Social Anxiety and Making Friends,"
Hi everyone!

I’ve had social anxiety since childhood, and I never realized how much it would impact my life, especially now that I’m in university. I’m currently in my first year and I'm studying in another country far away from my home country, and the past couple of months have been really tough. I haven’t been able to make any new friends, and being away from my family has left me feeling quite lonely and isolated.

I’ve always found it difficult to engage in conversations because I never really practiced them growing up. Now, I struggle to know what to say, and my conversation skills feel underdeveloped. On top of that, my English speaking isn’t as strong as my understanding, so I often find myself staying quiet and feeling even more anxious.

I’ve tried to overcome my anxiety by seeking one-on-one sessions, but the waitlists are long, and I haven’t found much success so far. I also feel like I lack hobbies or interests that could help me connect with others, as I’ve mostly spent my time online gaming or just staying indoors.

I’m reaching out to see if anyone has advice or strategies that helped them overcome similar challenges. How did you manage to build connections and feel more comfortable in social settings? And how can I improve my conversion skills? I’d really appreciate any insights or experiences you could share.

Thank you so much!",1764341967.0,socialanxiety
1p8tl1d,20M just trying to put something out there for once,I've had social anxiety my entire life and I've never really progressed at all and have essentially become a bit of a recluse. I've recently been in a bit of therapy stuff and It was suggested I chat with people somewhere online. I've never really done that before and I sort of just stumbled upon here.  I've always been pretty aimless and felt hopeless but have always sort of just clung on to some vague sense of hope for no tangible reason.  I guess just putting something online is a good enough step for me for now. I imagine it must be difficult for other people to take their first step too.  Does anyone here have any sort of idea where I could reach out to other people more easily for example a discord server or something I'm from the UK if that's meaningful at all.

1p8ld25,PTSD related social anxiety vent,"Hello friends, (tw assult)
I am unsure if this is the right thread. Prior to a violent assult, I had terrible social anxiety. I was working through this by doing doordash, exploring the beautiful areas around me. Now its just messed up my perceptions of my community and safety. Im too scared to work in my community area. 
I live in an area known for violence, drug use, and other crimes. We are mostly low income area. Not to say there are some lovely people around too that ive met. But mostly, people keep to themselves. 
 Last Nov, my partner and I were victims of random act of violence and road rage. This person, on drugs, brake checked me and got out swinging a machete. I sped away, him following. But Had to stop at a crossroad intersection with too much traffic. He then got out, punched my partner through the window and Then proceeded to fight my partner in the street, breaking three of his ribs. The fight back on myself and my partners side came from survival, not letting the bloke get back to his machete which was on the ground during the scuffle. People everywhere in cars and trucks, and no one helped. People even stopped to film, egging the fight on! 
 He made some very intense threats of death and The bloke who assaulted us just so bloody happens to live around the corner from us. 
He's been charged with a lot. Unfortunately the police system here has been lax on youth crime. He's yet to be sentenced. In the meantime. I've gone backwards. I am very hesitant where I go, what roads I take, who is around me, where the nearest exits are, all this silly anxious stuff that makes me feel like home is my only sanctuary. 
I have been trying, I guess, exposure therapy. I have to venture into community for health services and necessities. I haven't been able to doordash since. Losing an income i relied on.

1p8i7u4,How to talk to my crush,"I'm kinda confused about whether this shy girl likes me. As I said in my other posts, she seems to be staring at me a lot, and I connected the dots about why I think she has a crush on me.

The first sign was her and her friend (the one I know) looking back at me on the walk and laughing. Then she kept looking at me — both her and her friend. At the start of this year, she was staring at me all the time. When we came back to school, I noticed she was talking to this gay guy during P.E., and she was dead-on staring at me while I was running in soccer.

Then in class, I was looking at my friend when the shy girl’s friend looked at me. I looked back, and she laughed. I know that friend definitely doesn’t like me, as I talked to her a lot before, but ever since the shy girl started staring at me, the friend started acting weird too.

A week before Halloween, I counted the shy girl looking at me 10 times. It’s not my imagination. Today she was looking at me a lot while she was by herself. Even when people were working in groups, she was alone or just with one friend, and still looking at me. It’s starting to make me mad and also feel sorry for her. I know what it's like to not have anyone. I used to be really introverted and had anxiety from ages 13 to 15, but I made some friends who helped a lot. Now everyone sees me as the chill guy who doesn’t talk much but can have a bit of fun.

Anyway, on Monday I tried to talk to her on the walk. I went beside her and said, “How are you?” She didn’t answer, so I just looked at her. She turned her head; we made full eye contact. I looked away, she looked away, and then I walked over to someone else. I’m pretty sure it came out weird because I can’t talk to anyone unless they talk to me first.

In the next two classes she was still looking at me. This week, she keeps looking at me anytime I talk to a teacher. In the computer room, I saw her looking at me when I was by myself. One time my friend was behind her, and when I was walking by, she was by herself. She made eye contact, I made eye contact — it felt like she thought I was going up to her. I didn’t know why, but it felt like she wanted to talk to me, and I probably seemed like an ass for not doing anything.

I don’t know why anyone would like me, and I only connected the dots a month ago.

Also, her friend in 5th year got her to talk to me on one of those old phones. This is how obvious it is when women like me — I’m like, “Why?” to her friend, and she said “Just talk,” smiling. I go on the phone and say, “Umm… hi,” and I hear the shy girl giggle and say “Hi.” Then her friend said, “Say something else,” and because I’m so socially awkward, I think I said “How are you,” or I said nothing.

I don’t know what to do. I think I’m gonna try again. Today, I went out the door before her to go to the other campus, and guess who somehow catches up to me out of nowhere? Her — just a tiny bit behind me, not too close. Could she have been trying to talk to me?

To be honest, I’d want to be friends with her before even thinking about dating. But she is my type — a shy woman with dark black hair and a bit of a tan. I’d really like to get to know her, but anytime I’m near her, I get butterflies. My heart starts racing, and it probably happens to her too.

I’m sick of my social anxiety, but it’s worse around her. I hate the feeling, but it would be nice to take the risk — even if it just leads to us being friends. I hated seeing her sitting alone at the park today. I just know how she feels having no one. We’re alike in that way — we keep to ourselves and talk only when spoken to.

Hopefully things work out, but I want ideas on how to talk to her and how to get her to talk to me.",1764292891.0,socialanxiety

Next years my last year and then uni. And I know youll say ""youll make freinds there!!!"". But no. What if the cycle continues again, i don't talk, i ignore. 

I feel kinda jealous and broken as i don't have close freinds I can just hang out with and just chat with everyday, especially since I'm a teen. I don't know why but i just can't seem to talk to people and get anxious. I have freinds sure.. but I only hang out with em twice a week and I barely chat openly, deeply to them. I'm  basocially stuck in a house for 2 months until school starts again.

  
Oh yeahh youll probably say ""join clubs!!"". Im in australia, there is none much in my city.

1p7y7yu,It's exhausting that society expects us to be chatty,"Especially in the office. Sure there are some quiet people, but most are chatting away (more than they are actually doing the work they're supposed to).

I didn't really get how some of them would just do it everyday with 100% energy all the time, and I really need to get a promotion (especially in this economy ), so I bit the bullet and asked one of the most social ones ( guy called James) how he did it.

what he said was pretty shocking, turns out the guy was actually sent to a neurodivergent school when he was younger because he was so quiet and shy.

he said that when he was 18, he tried to speak out loud for 30 mins a day in order to deepen his voice, it didn't work, but he found a strange side effect that he could now talk to people better. He said practices for an hour every single day, if he doesn't for a week or so, his conversation ability and confidence go down.

I tried doing this recently, seen some early success. So I just wanted to let you guys know about this to see if this would help you.

also btw, I'm creating a small group for some people on reddit I met to practice with this and share experiences, if anyone wants to join us, feel free to send me a direct message/chat :)",1764236522.0,socialanxiety

At one point a song popped up in my YouTube music algorithm and I recognized that he had the album cover as his Steam profile pic, so I figured I should probably listen to it. Ended up liking the song so when anything else I recognized as being something he likes popped into my feed id give that a listen too. Now two or so months later my feed is flooded with stuff he listens to. Some of it is not necessarily my thing but I like the guy so I've been trying to get into it.

1p7piii,Fundraising / street sales is like therapy that pays you…,"It’s so great. I wish I did this 10 years ago. I’m 32 now, I actually interviewed for a fundraising job 10 years ago.. but it was a large group interview where we had to pitch in front of lots of people, and I was scared as hell and stumbled completely my anxiety won and made me look a fool. 

Fast forward to 3 months ago, my misery reaching peak after being rejected for being nervous on a date, I was totally fed up with myself, I was tired of being a mouse and hiding my true self to people. I started going to the gym, eating right, going outside more, then found the courage to join a local charity to fundraise. It was smaller group session, this was manageable for me. I got the job barely, then the first week came, I got a sign up literally the first person that I stopped by complete beginners luck, after that nothing, just fear of approaching people, but 1 on 1 conversations weren’t that bad especially if I could hide behind the easy pitch so I got like 8 over next 3 weeks. 

During this time, not much changed I gained a little confidence, but as I said I hid behind a pitch. But then 1 day, I was feeling a bit more merry, I was happy about life and the present moment so I decided to let loose spontaneously, and I became literally the most Charismatic version of me I’ve ever witnessed, like I was magnetic for 1 hour, and I felt free in the world for the rare few times since childhood. I had wanted to quit 10+ before this day, but something kept telling me to push on. 

This Charasmatic day was not replicated the second day, hell it only came back to me in about a week, back to my old patterns of thought and hiding behind the shell. But the gap between those free days has been getting shorter and shorter ever since like my brain is learning that people aren’t scary anymore. 

I’m at about 50% 50% days when I’m confident days when I’m not, in my new fundraising gig, when working with very charismatic confident people, I still notice I hide myself, like I’m intimidated by what they think, but I keep letting loose, I keep forcing myself to focus on my validation and not others, and it’s fucking working bit by bit, I literally can’t wait to go back into work now, it’s so thrilling growing socially and becoming more confident the job becomes like a drug, like a life changing therapy that you get paid to do. 

I recommend anyone doing it if they can, and if not, build yourself up to do it. Social anxiety is about not being proud of yourself enough to be vulnerable in front of others, to show your true authentic self. Learn to respect a little thing about yourself, could be changing your diet going gym etc. then try fundraising maybe for a day a week volunteering. But it’s key you keep at it.

to make it short some classmates had tried in the past to include me but i was so scared and ashamed i rejected them until they stopped asking.

1p7fdne,Why Strangers Are Sometimes Easier to Talk To Than Friends,"# The Paradox of Stranger Intimacy

Many people find it easier to share deep feelings with strangers than with those closest to them. This isn't a flaw in your relationships—it's human nature.

# The Weight of History

Existing relationships come with context. Friends and family know your past, your patterns, your usual self. This history can feel constraining when you're struggling with something new or out of character.

# Fear of Changing the Dynamic

Revealing struggles to people in your life risks altering how they see you. Will they still respect you? Will they worry too much? Will it burden them? These concerns create barriers to honest communication.

# The Clean Slate Effect

Strangers offer a fresh perspective without baggage. They judge you only on what you share in that moment, not colored by years of accumulated impressions.

# No Stakes, No Pressure

There's freedom in knowing you'll never see someone again. You can be completely honest without worrying about ongoing consequences or awkward future encounters.

# Professional Distance

The slight formality of stranger interaction can actually make vulnerability easier. It's like therapy—the structured distance creates safety for emotional exploration.

# Unbiased Listening

Friends may have their own agendas or opinions about your situation. Strangers can offer a neutral ear without the complications of invested interest.

# The Gift of Anonymity

Anonymous communication takes this further. Without even the social dance of introduction and small talk, you can dive straight into what matters.

# Breaking the Isolation

Sometimes we just need to say things out loud—or write them down—to someone, anyone. Strangers fulfill this need without the emotional complexity of close relationships.

Understanding why strangers feel safe doesn't mean your close relationships are lacking. It means recognizing that different connections serve different needs. Both matter.

1p7d1c9,Living with social anxiety feels like carrying an invisible weight,"There was once a time when I thought that social anxiety just meant being shy or awkward in social situations. However, I now see that social anxiety is much more complicated and difficult to manage than that.

Social anxiety means standing at the entrance to a room filled with people while your chest feels tight. You want to speak, but cannot get the words out of your mouth. You can replay everything you said hours after the fact over and over, wondering if what you said was ""weird."" You are constantly either avoiding phone calls, canceling plans, and then feeling guilty about spending time alone because you want to connect, but panic when you're trying to make that connection ever happen. 

To me, the worst part of having social anxiety wasn't the panic attacks, but the feeling of being an observer instead of living your life.

I've been tackling from different angles and ways; I keep rack of my anxiety symptoms, practicing my breathing techniques, and writing down everything I think of throughout the day have given me small victories.

1p798iy,Struggling with social anxiety,"Hey everyone,
I’ve been trying to push myself socially, so I’ve started going to badminton games with strangers. I’m a beginner, and most people there play way better than me. They try to guide me, I try to respond politely, but my social anxiety gets triggered badly.

Here’s the problem:
When someone plays a great rally or hits a good shot, everyone reacts naturally — cheering, laughing, appreciating.
But I… don’t know how to react.

I either say yes, good one very softly, or don’t react at all because I feel awkward. And then I start thinking everyone must be judging me as rude or uninterested. Honestly, I’m not doing it from the heart — I’m reacting just because of FOMO. It all feels forced.

At the same time, I can’t focus on the game because my brain keeps running:
What are they thinking about me?
Am I too quiet?
Am I making mistakes?
Do I look weird as a beginner?
Why can’t I act normal like others?

I’m trying my best to show up, but every time I feel like I’m “incompatible” with people or that I’ll never be able to connect socially. It hits my confidence really hard.
I also live alone, so now I am thinking it would have been good if I will be living with someone or have some friends nearby..

Has anyone else faced this?

1p78lj7,What's the deal with me?,"This is a long story, so hear me out: there was a time in my life where I was social and thought I finally belonged somewhere, my high school class. Before I never really felt truly in a community, but having genuine fun with them and rediscovering the joy of interacting with people, but I was still closed off and introverted. Then, last year, after failing at handling having a crush, I decided: screw it. I wanna come out to some people, and I want him to know I like him eventually. 2 people. The whole class knew then and spread the rumor around. However, those days felt like I was FREE. Those days, even if that happened, were the best for me. I was getting really active talking to people, moved by excitement. I said merry xmas to them, talked to them about about my personal issues(stuff I wasn't doing with anybody before), then something felt off inside. I thought that they were taking advantage of me, and I blamed it on them, on not setting boundaries and that feeling of energy rush being around people left. I hated myself and my way of communicating.

Now, after a year, I'm scared to have autism, to be different, and when I talk, I never say something personal about me. I dunno if it's because I fear the past or whatever, but there's always a context in which I think: if I say this, people will react negatively. Example from today: I thought about coming up to the group I usually hang around in and casually start with: ""hey guys, do you watch tv series? I recently started Hazbin Hotel and damn it's good."" when there's a slight moment of silence and I don't speak over others.
Then something pulled me off: don't creeps start up at people like that? I thought screw it but I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth so I awkwardly stood there without saying a word until I went back to my seat and minded my own business.

I was like this at school and at college constantly making a fool of myself. I don’t know how I could do this for years. It’s so exhausting.

And honestly I was happy when my friends moved to another cities bc I felt like I can finally be free. No more pretending.

I have made a big effort to put myself out there recently but the truth is just that there are always people more outgoing than me, with better personalities than me, who can just effortlessly do everything better than me and therefore draw in all the friends 

I have been going to this club, 2 hours a week, it is the only time of the week where I really talk to anyone, the rest of the time I am just very lonely. There have been a few times where I thought I was coming closer to making friends with people just to be hit with the realisation they have tens of people more sociable and more desirable as a friend than me, so I don't really have a chance and I don't really see the point in going anymore because I know I will just forget how to talk and feel like my presence is embarrassing and unwanted. The last couple weeks I didn't really say much to anyone and then I left the club feeling really bummed out, which sucked because I always hype myself up and look forward to this one opportunity for connection in my week

I have felt this way my whole life. I tried joining a club in january as well and I just stopped turning up after a month when I realised how pointless it was. I moved recently so thought I should try again but it is just the same as always: even when I try to talk my speech is disjointed and strange, I have weird interests, even when I meet other strange people it is like I am too alien to click with anyone and make real conversation. I feel stunted by my social anxiety and autism. My anxiety always gets the best of me and I freeze up. I have basically no social life and no support group

I’ve only ever had two ex best friends who I haven’t even seen and talked to in over half a decade now because they have lives and families of their own. Other than them, I’ve not had a single friend, and I’m not kidding when I say that I have been spending all these years, even back then too in my teens, in my room or house in general. Bedrotting and being on my phone all the time, or listening to music or watching something. I’ve never partied a day in my life. I’ve never been to a club or anything like that. I’ve never had a single friend group. Not even a friend group of only three people. It was always ONLY me one on one with either of my two ex best friends. That’s it. That’s been my social life. I’ve never even had a job because I’m so scared of working in the public and having to deal with people. I literally hardly have any actual memories of my youth to look back on at this point and I feel like it’s way too late for me now. I mean let’s be real, how many people truly begin to finally make friends and actually go out and do things with friends for the first time in their life in their late 20s and in their 30s? Not very many people, most people have already had a gazillion friends and friend groups and have already gone out clubbing, partying, traveling, and just overall living and having a social life by that point. Also by this point most people are starting to settle down. So it’s just not the same. I’ve already given up hope. I’m really gonna be be 30 fucking years old and never having had a single friend group and never having actually lived and gone out and done things with friends like clubbing, traveling, or just anything it doesn’t even even have to be that. It’s really too fucking late for me isn’t it. When I see literally everyone else in their 20s having so many friends and friend groups always going out and doing something together, or even just having chill hangouts at someone’s place, I just cannot relate. At all. AT ALL. I’m extremely depressed and that’s not exaggerating. I feel completely doomed and hopeless. I’ll never have friends, I’ll never have a social life, and I sure as hell won’t even begin to try now at this point in my life. It really is too late for me and there’s no sugarcoating it. It would be so fucking weird and embarrassing of me to finally begin making friends and finally going out more and having a social life at almost 27 when this is the around the age most people begin to settle down! There’s no point in trying, I’m just gonna live my ENTIFE fucking life not ever having had any friends and a social life and never making memories.

I can’t even begin to try to have a youth now because it’s fucking OVER! My youth is fucking OVER! So I don’t have any other choice but to just fucking accept it and let myself continue to rot away in loneliness and isolation in my house, in my room until I fucking die.

It’s not like I can just lie and say I’m 21 again just so I can give myself the illusion of having more time to finally make friends and go out and live. Nope. I’m almost 27.

Hello people from Reddit

  
It's my first time posting here and using Reddit altogether. I'd like to post here for asking for help to understand myself and overcome a struggle we all have in common here: social interactions.

  
Actually, my post might get overlooked because what isn't lacking over here definitely is not people asking for help with social interactions, but my case is a little different: I don't feel any bit of anxiety.

  
Firstly, here's some context:

  
In my childhood, I was, contrary to what I stated above, a really shy kid, the kind one that would be quiet all the time, talk to nobody and be overly nervous with social interactions with any person. 

I was also very school smart, and that alone made me even more socially anxious and feel out of touch with other people - feel like I don't belong anywhere.

  
The fact that I was school smart made other kids bully me and exclude me, that strengthened my isolation.

  
This fear of social interactions accompanied me until high school. When I finished school and started to have my adult life, my shyness vanished.

  
However, nothing changed regarding my social interactions.

  
Loneliness is something I have been struggling with since approximately 14 years old - when somehow my mind shifted into a depression that extended until high school.

  
Even though I don't feel any glimpse of anxiety among other people, it's like my brain got used to thinking I'm ""different"", I don't belong with people, I don't have any common conversation subjects with them, I lack social skills, etc., and, despite not causing me anxiety: I also tend to think that I'm boring, they will reject me for being boring.

  
Despite the fact I understand that all these thoughts are false and residual from my childhood, I don't seem internalize the opposite of these thoughts.

  
I somehow know that one of the ways to overcome maladaptive thinking patterns is to challenge yourself with other thoughts and ""force"" behaving. I plan (a long time ago) to start conversations with people but my inner voice comes saying ""What are you going to start a conversation about?"".

  
The worst part is I don't feel any anxiety, as I stated. I'm in this company for one year now, I did excellent in the interview, showing a lot of social skills (contrary to my inner voice). But I still feel stuck. It's like I prove to myself I can do it, however that doesn't sink in.

  
Has anyone experienced something similar?",1764113556.0,socialanxiety

Anxiety is not the enemy—it’s like an overprotective but well-meaning friend.

Confidence is built through experience, not something you're born with.

Shifting attention outward, instead of inward, is key to managing anxiety.

Your brain is not broken. Social anxiety amplifies perceived threats, making neutral
situations feel high-stakes.

Confidence isn’t “no fear.” It’s learning how to act even when afraid.

1p6o1gy,Nervous laughter,"I deal with this 1-2 times per month where, when my social anxiety is bad, I’ll give a bit of a nervous laugh to someone instead of answering them back if I’m just passing by them rather than being in a full blown conversation.

It happens on occasion when I don’t hear what they said and I know they’re expecting a response. It’s like some sort of reflex, and then I feel embarrassed and also then worry about potentially offending them once it happens.

It also happened recently while walking a dog I was pet sitting. The person opened up their arms when they saw the dog I was walking, so I started to anticipate social interaction. I expected the person to greet the dog, because I figured they must know her or at the least would probably say she’s cute or something. 

Well they said good afternoon, and instead of saying anything back I gave a little nervous laugh and kept walking. Now I am embarrassed, and I am also worried they will either think I’m weird or rude for laughing at them for no reason. Or else they’ll think I think they’re weird for no reason. 

I was tired. I was also anticipating something different to happen during the social interaction— them greeting the dog. I thought they must either know the dog or must think she’s cute. I think that is why I got nervous, because I expected something else. And was also real tired. 

Social anxiety makes no sense, and now the person must think I’m either weird or rude. There was no reason for me to nervously laugh, the person didn’t do anything weird. It was all because I was tired and was expecting a different social interaction. 

This has happened a couple times when I’ve passed someone and didn’t hear what they said. The pressure of having to respond but having no response/feeling awkward for missing what they said equals me giving a bit of a nervous laugh and continuing my walk.

This happens only a couple of times a month, but I hate the idea of people being possibly offended by it. 

It’s only a bit of a nervous laugh. 

Maybe the thing with the dog had something to do with the pressure of having to respond quickly as I was passing the person, too. Since I expected the attention to be on the dog and not me, I didn’t have a response at the ready. ",1764103716.0,socialanxiety

I write to him ""if u guys are planing anything or smth hit me up"" said sure

1p6lm9m,That time of the year (company’s Christmas party),"In December I will attend my company’s Christmas party and I’ve been anxious on and off about it since they first announced it (1 month ago). 
I’ve been at this job for around one year, but I work remotely so I’ve never met anyone of my colleagues. I don’t know if they have all met, but they have certainly been working together for a long long time and some of them seem to be very close. 
I especially dread the idea of showing up there at the venue, not knowing if my teammates are already there, not knowing anybody else and being completely incapable of starting a conversation. 
I know it’s just a party and if I have a good time great, and if I don’t it’s not the end of the world but it’s so exhausting being constantly anxious about these things. I don’t usually find myself having to go out of my comfort zone that much, so when I do, I try to take the “chance” to challenge myself a little bit. Also, I must say that while working remotely is amazing, it definitely doesn’t help my social skills. 
Also, this thing will last from 7pm to 1am. WHO even wants to stay that long?? Do you think it would be acceptable to just stay a few hours and then go? 
I know I need to just see things from a different perspective, but it’s so difficult at times. I’m still thinking about a last minute excuse, I already feel overwhelmed. I wouldn’t go, but it appears to me you are quite “encouraged” to participate to these sort of things, so I feel like I should show up at least this time and maybe skip the nexts.

I would do the same thing when I worked nights in retail. Say “good evening” or “have a good night” till I had the “good morning” rehearsed. I quit that job while working mornings, so that’s what has stuck with me since. Till about a year ago. But I still do it on occasion.

I’ve noticed I’m not the only one who has done this while having a job where the automatic response is “good morning” or “have a good night.” 

I think most people understand, but I still feel awkward.

I’ve done this with a multitude of rehearsed responses. Now I’m trying to slowly wean myself off of using rehearsed responses as my social anxiety decreases, since I need them a little less. 

I ended up moving to the state I would visit for years, and an automatic response to where I was visiting would always be this state I am living in now when I lived elsewhere. 

Well I was tired the one day and told them I was visiting the state I live in now, because this is the state I’d always be visiting in the past. I laughed and explained it was just my automatic response since I haven’t lived here all that long. In my defense I was real tired that day. ",1764095138.0,socialanxiety
1p6ito6,I don’t understand why I’m constantly being excluded - is it my fault at this point?,"hi, I need some advice - (sorry if this comes across like a sob story, I just need another perspective) 

I recently joined a new school along with a classmate that I was friends with.

At the beginning of the term, most people from the school were decent and friendly to me, and were clearly interested in talking to me too, and I managed to make a small amount of friends. Fast forward to now, people who were friendly generally treat me like hot air - for example, with the classmate I talked about, we’ll have one on one conversations sometimes but if we’re in a big group, she often pretend I don’t exist. Generally now, I get ignored and often excluded, and I think people who I don’t know me make me the butt of their jokes - also I think that it’s too late for me to try and make new friends

I know that my social anxiety and personality is probably off putting and that I probably have many problems about myself that I don’t even realise, but I’ve been in this exact situation so many times that there MUST be something wrong with me. 

The worst part is that when I feel like my friends actually care about me and invite me to stuff, I temporarily get happy and feel like I’m not alone, and that I don’t have to worry anymore about it, but the moment they drop me again I sink and spiral again and feel low

I’ve tried to convince myself that I’m ok with being alone but I don’t think I’ll make it through 2 years of school like this 


tldr: joined a new school where most people were friendly at first but suddenly starting getting awkward and cold around me. This situation has happened more than once so this has to be my fault at this point? ",1764092203.0,socialanxiety
1p6h4ws,I'm terrified of 'casual' social environments but perfectly fine in any others. Anyone experince something similar? I'm confused,"I have always had issues with my social skills and I've always put work into fixing them. Right now I think I do great at many social environments, recently I've participated in a couple of job fairs where I interviewed with companies and spoke to recruiters for hours, I also participated in a hackathon where we were put in teams with complete strangers and did perfectly fine, I even was the spokeperson for the team and presented a pitch deck in front of hundreds of people. I've spent almost 8 years in a theatre club, I've done impro, writing classes, worked in different teams as a leader and team coordinator talking to everyone and I've done completely fine and had lots of fun. These events are pure adrenaline to me.

But for some reason I **completely panic** at the though of any casual situation. Imagine a situation like:  
I'm in class and one of my friends/classmates who I've seen every weekday for a year and a half suggests grabbing a drink after class. I'll react as if they had pointed a gun at me.  
Another example: an online friend I've had for over two years and who I've had the best of conversations with tells me they're coming to my city and we could meet. I'll go MIA and completely ghost them.  
I'm actually writing this because a guy from my city who I've been talking to for about a month suggested yesterday that we could meet up. I've been sad and paralized since then and still haven't answered his message.

I have lost friends, connections and opportunities because of acting like this and it's like some kind of curse I don't even understand. I've done therapy and it has helped me with many things (I am extremely thankful for therapy and for how much of a calmer and aware person it has made me) but this one thing just doesn't seem to get fixed.

So yeah, anyone experience something similar? Any tips on dealing with this situation are appreciated",1764088491.0,socialanxiety

So when i think about graduating highschool soon and not seeing them everyday anymore, it brings me a feeling of relief of having to not worry about what they think of me anymore, even though it makes me feel slightly guilty. 

And the thought of these kinds of things makes me question everything, because arent friendships supposed to bring you happiness and dont people miss them after graduating? How come keeping friends always feels so exhausting, it makes me wonder if its even worth it.

My voice is usually soft and low toned because of my anxiety and I get stutter blocks, which create pauses in speech. Because of this, people sometimes don’t hear me or unintentionally ignore what I’m saying. Even when I try to speak louder the stutter blocks are present which makes me feel more embarrassed.

Lately been trying to work on myself — expressing myself more, going to gym, making eye contact, talking to people, and reducing screen time and sexual desires that's helping for sure, but still feels far from what I want to be.

Over the years worked hard academically and some of the greatest minds in my country (not bragging just saying), and I feel like I do have a social and relaxed personality (people call me chill guy).

Where I’m from, I also look a bit different (lighter-skinned), so people sometimes glorify my skin color, but I worry that once I speak, they might lose interest or see me differently because of my stutter.

I feel like this is holding me back from becoming the person I want to be. Any tips encouraged.",1764076392.0,socialanxiety
1p6bwjo,Small talk is just soul crushing...,"I've never understood the culture of small talk tbh. When you greet a stranger in a public place for some reason, it's almost an obligation to ask them how they day is going and they always have to say that their day is going great. Both of you know that you don't really listen to each other in that moment, both of you don't really care. Like, you're not supposed to say that your day is not going well or ask clarifying questions. It's just a mindless ritual that for some reason we keep doing again and again. It feels like a bunch of corpo talk where you're supposed to say the right things to get a job offer after an interview.

If you meet a person with an intention to find new friends or a romantic relationship, you start asking them questions about themselves. What they do for living, what their interests are, etc. What I noticed, is that even at this stage, when you're supposed to GET TO KNOW them better, even at this stage people keep talking in the small talk mode. They say things, but they don't expect you to listen to them. It's like they are just talking out loud about themselves, they don't expect any reaction. They want to keep things at a surface level when everything is going well without going into details. 

I value depth in conversations. I find small talk boring. I ask people clarifying questions if something doesn't make sense to me or I disagree with them. They are almost shocked about it. They say that ""I'm different"". All I do is simply actually take my time to listen to them and take interest in what they have to say. It's a simple act of showing some respect to another person.

I wake up, but the day doesn’t start… it presses down on me like a weight I can’t lift. I look in the mirror. The reflection is mine, but it’s fractured. My eyes betray every sleepless night, every anxious heartbeat. My jaw tightens. My brain spins on a frequency no one else can hear.

I walk to the kitchen. Coffee. Not for pleasure, for survival. I overthink every movement: the cup too close, the spoon too loud. My mind races ahead, imagining every judgment, every silent critique from the world I’m about to face. I am hyper-aware of the self I present—clumsy, awkward, misunderstood.

I leave the apartment and step outside. The city hums, alive and indifferent. People brush past me, and I feel like a ghost in the crowd. A woman walks by, her laugh like a spotlight. I want connection, intimacy, a spark… but my anxiety suffocates me before I can breathe.

At work, I overcompensate. Every word, every glance, every action is calculated. I’m sharp, intelligent, perceptive… but misunderstood. My temper flares, my thoughts explode internally. People see a hint of arrogance or moodiness, but they don’t see the battlefield behind my eyes. They don’t know the war I fight just to exist.

I come home, exhausted. Alone. But even in solitude, I can’t rest. Thoughts spin: missed opportunities, unspoken words, failed connections. My brain hums, racing, analyzing. Yet, somewhere inside, a flame burns. A voice whispers: “You are not defeated. You are still here. You are still fighting.”

I write again: “They may not see me, but I see me. And that’s enough… for now.”

The world outside my apartment door is a minefield. I sit on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor, every step I plan to take in the hallway feeling like crossing a tightrope above a canyon. The key in the lock trembles in my hand. My stomach twists; my heart races. Each passing thought whispers, “Everyone is watching. Everyone is judging.”

I open the door. Just a crack. The hallway stretches ahead, fluorescent lights flickering. I step out. One, two, three. My feet wobble. I can feel the eyes of strangers pressing through walls. Every shadow is a critic. Every whisper, a condemnation. I’m not moving fast enough. I’m too slow. I’m too awkward.

The grocery store isn’t safe either. People talk, laugh, glance at me. I stumble in my own thoughts, overanalyzing every glance, every movement, every word. I wonder if they can see the panic in my veins. I reach for alcohol… not for the taste… but for courage, for camouflage, for the illusion that I am normal.

Back home, I collapse onto the couch. I think of my ambition, the fire trapped inside me. I’m brilliant and broken. I want women, connections, closeness with family… but I’m trapped behind walls my own mind built. I’m isolated, misunderstood, angry, depressed, yet I rise again every day, trying to break through the invisible chains.

I write in the dim light: “I will persevere. I will fight. I will not be defined by fear, even if fear defines every moment.”

so anyways, i had assumed it would be the same thing as usual. we pulled in the parking lot, and he asked if i wanted to call and order ahead. i said sure, but wanted to confirm that he would be the one talking, and not me. he said he wanted me to order this time, and i kind of just froze and said “i don’t know.” he said we could either go inside and i can order there, or i can call them and order over the phone, but we would sit there until i made up my mind and followed thru. still frozen, i just said “idk” and i couldn’t look him in the face. we sat there for probably 20 minutes in silence before he gave up and went inside and ordered for both of us. 

i feel ashamed and guilty that i couldn’t even say anything to him, i couldn’t look up, my face was all hot, whatever you get my point

i’m sick of my anxiety essentially running my life and i’m not exactly sure what to do here. even just thinking about ordering food somewhere scares me, asking a cashier how their day is going, simple day to day actions make me feel embarrassed. idk what to do soooo here i am!!! any advice would be great, anything i should bring up to him, anythings helpful

1p5wxmj,i humiliated myself at andy mans club 😭😭,"like even before i even arrived at the bus station i were already pissed because two strangers walked past me one of them yelled ""BWALALALA"" randomly unexpectedly in my face the other said sorry afterwards. i began crying. most people gave me weird stares and if anyone did ask if i were okay theyd tell me to just ignore it.  
you're seriously underestimating how traumatic harrassment is. especially when you're harrassed like a woman would be when you identify as male.  
idk why i attract harrassment from strangers so much why am i such an easy target i dress like a male all the fcking time it makes me suicidal.

ik Andy mans club is supposed to help you but i regret having attended in the first place. considering it does indeed feel uncomfortable being the only transgender one.

anyway when i arrived. i was embarrased by how i:

* i tried to explain lgbt labels to older men. i told them that i feel partially male partially non binary and i'm averse to being hyper-masculine. they told me they also find hyper masculinity cringe and i were like ""well that doesn't by any means make you demiboys, you're just well men"" (internal vomit). it made me feel like my gender maybe wasn't kinda valid.
* cared about how fishing is illegal in the uk i were like ""don't you have to have a permit?"" . was embarrassed by this because i look like an idiot trusting the government/law blindly.
* naively fell for the NHS, optimistically believing it was the ONLY option private therapy did NOT exist (the guy that gave me the most gender envy out of all of em told me about a local private therapy, nice of him but still). so embarrassed to appear so naive and so law-abiding at the same time. so so so so so embarrassed. embarrassed for same reason as above.
* (potentially, idk) shared too much. the entire session i mentioned: the harrassment incident that occured just before i got there, being harrassed in general, dp/dr, health anxiety and feeling like a burden to the NHS or feeling dramatic because of it, how weird it feels to be the only transmasc at Andy mans club, that really embarrassing incident recently when i called fire service because i had an anxiety attack thinking my laundry machine was going to kill me, the pub in the town i vaguely remembered from my very early childhood and how i said i used to live in the town the club happened when i were a kid, my drug use history, how i were kicked out of one hospital for having too many health anxiety panic attacks (they all acted surprised that i got kicked out of A and e for being there every day), my religious beliefs, the fact my sibling is now transgender and also has a youtube channel and i've contacted her over text and reddit, and how the fact she cares about me demotivates me from kms.

the fact i get embarrassment after i've talked to people, rather than feeling nervous and planning waht i say in advance, makes me feel invalid. ",1764027295.0,socialanxiety
1p5vzdy,It wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t for people themselves,"Show any hint of social anxiety and it has a way of bringing out the bully in people. This all would be bearable if people were more decent and compassionate, but instead they almost subconsciously despise our vulnerability, our very real condition. Whatever vulnerability they fight to mask is more reason for them to hate our unmasked anxiety, it’s all projection, primitive power dynamics that most either don’t realize they do or have no shame that they do it.

Ultimately that’s the irony of it all, the severity of my social anxiety is very much caused by how much society despises it. The same can be said about Autistic people unmasking (I’m also an ND person), we fear unmasking only because we’ve been target when we did. Despite all the “awareness” about mental health, actually showing symptoms still gets you target in school, the workplace, everywhere really. We haven’t come that far.",1764024919.0,socialanxiety
1p5v2u0,Phobia of public speaking and social/performance anxiety,"Hi guys. I am really desperate here and just need some advice from a community that might have some knowledge on the topic. I am in my 4th year of med school, and this issue is starting to really effect my mental health, mood, relationships and career. I apologise in advance as this might be a slight rant.

To set the scene, I always had social anxiety growing up for as long as I can remember. Judging myself and being scared of other peoples judgements. However I seem to have developed a phobia of public speaking. This started in high school, after having a panic attack while giving a presentation up in front of the class. This was pretty traumatising for me - my voice trembled, I sounded like I was going to cry and felt like it too, and dissociated fully during and after the event. I felt like i was exposed. Now every time I have to present, or get called on to speak, I relive the same experience. Full dissociation where it feels like my head is going to explode, and an extreme sense of dread. Sometimes I feel like I’m going to die, genuinely. It’s traumatising every single time. And its happening multiple times a week as we constantly have to give presentations in med school and in the hospitals. I am able to suppress some of the physical symptoms via beta blockers (propranolol) but mentally it still tortures me. I also now get panic attacks in some every day conversations and around my girlfriend so I can never relax now.

Whenever I know I have a presentation coming up, or an interaction where I will have to engage socially and I will be judged, I can’t stop thinking about it. I obsess over it trying to find a way to avoid the anxiety, hoping it won’t come, trying to find a cure for my condition and what I’m going through. I spend hours every day researching this - it's like a full time job. My primary fear is that I will be visibly nervous and others will see - ie voice shaking, blanking out, crying, throwing up or passing out - or even just having to say sorry guys I can’t continue then having to explain myself. Nobody knows I deal with this and I’m terrified of being exposed. I worry that the beta blockers aren’t going to work - because sometimes in the past the symptoms have appeared despite being on beta blockers. And I want to stop taking beta blockers. I’m taking heavy doses (100mg+ propranolol) every single day and its affecting my ability to exercise which is also affecting my mood. I would just like to be able to speak and interact and live normally without having to numb my nervous system 24/7.

I have done 100s of presentations and clinical exams and oral exams in med school where I am being evaluated, yet I still haven’t got over the fear. In fact it’s worse than ever after 7 years of dealing with this. Straight up exposure is not working. I’m just completely sick to death of it and want rid of it.

I am looking into treatment options. But I’m overthinking the therapy because I really want to get it right. I have had a few initial consultations with therapists, but their approach doesn't seem right, they don't seem to understand me fully and I don't follow up with another session. I also don’t want to waste money (I’m a student) on the wrong therapist if they’re a bad fit or just a poor quality therapist. I also wonder if online therapy might be better than in person due to finding better therapist? I have heard about the limitations of CBT, so I’m cautious about engaging in CBT alone. I feel like some deeper work may be necessary - schema therapy, IFS to address childhood trauma, EMDR to address acute traumatic events from specific public speaking events, and somatic therapy to try and regain a sense of safety in my body again. These are just some of my thoughts. But it’s just that all the options are overwhelming. And I don’t know how to find a therapist that can do all of this. I have also just begun antidepressant medication (sertraline) in an attempt to try and combat some of the excessive rumination and worry which will hopefully make my phobia a bit better.

If anyone has any advice for me in my situation I would be really thankful. It’s just very hard figuring all of this out alone by myself and some support would be nice. Anything in terms of what kinds of therapy might be useful to help my specific performance anxiety situation around public speaking. Also any personal experiences, or people you know of that have treated this, and any resources which may be helpful.",1764022748.0,socialanxiety

I did everything I could by following social protocols such as consoling someone when they are sad or helping them with their work/assignments but yet I am resented.

1p5spv9,social anxiety mindsets,"hey guys! over time, I’ve gathered some mindsets that really helped me deal with social anxiety. here:

1. ""everyone likes me unless proven otherwise"". people generally only dislike you if they have a real reason.
2. your anxiety signs aren't as visible to others as you think. the ones sensitive enough to see are often sensitive enough to care.
3. acknowledge your anxiety and don't try to deny it. ""I am nervous and it is ok"".
4. most people aren't judging you. in reality they’re distracted, tired, stressed, or thinking about themselves.
5. exposure. act despite fear and discomfort. if you feel uncomfortable, do it anyways, because growth happens outside your comfort zone.
6. mistakes are allowed and they are ok. they make you appear more human and relatable to others.
7. there will always be haters, no matter what anyone does - even the people you admire have their own haters.

1p5p8qn,Socially Anxiety Sucks,"

This is me venting. I don't expect anyone to give me advice but you are all very welcome to share your experiences on this topic. I apologize if this post is confusing or hard to read. I'm writing this in my second language after a night where I couldn't sleep and my thoughts spiraled into deep self-discovery.

I (18M) only realized a month ago that I've been struggling with social anxiety for as long as I can remember. When I was young(er), everyone thought I was 'shy' or said 'he doesn't like talking a lot' and I guess it reinforced that idea in my mind. From the age of 4-5 until 18 I've grown up thinking I was just a shy person.

However, about a month ago I tried MDMA with three of my closest and almost only friends. It let me experience what it's like to communicate without my own body and mind working against me for no reason. I could speak my mind freely without my brain immediately dismissing all thoughts and leaving my mind blank. I didn't have any nervousness or tightness in my chest. I felt like a new person -- a person I've always wanted to be but never thought I'd be able to be. I'm not sure if the drug changed me into someone I actually am not or maybe all it did was lift my social barriers but I really hope it's the latter and it is possible for me to become that kind of person. After that whole experience I discovered that I'm not just shy. Looking back, there are moments where I can be one of the most confident people in the room (while sober). I thought I was shy, but shyness doesn’t take over your whole body the way social anxiety does. Since then I've been acknowledging my anxiety and trying to work towards overcoming it although it truly feels impossible.

Now about the reason I am writing this post. Recently, the four of us did MDMA again. This time however, I told them about me realizing that I don't talk a lot because I have social anxiety. They told me how much they like talking to me and how they wish I’d speak more, along some other nice things. You have no idea how hard I try. It feels Iike my head becomes an empty void as soon as I interact with someone no matter how long I've known them. It makes me cry when I think about all the missed opportunities for emotional connection. They feel close to me, but I struggle to feel the same level of connection back no matter how much I want to, and I don’t know how to explain it. I feel like I’ve been isolating myself without meaning to, and I don’t know how to put that feeling into words.

I don't want to glamorize drugs so I have to add that MDMA didn't fix me but it revealed something that I didn't even know I was searching for.

I also started thinking about what could have caused my anxiety. Then I remembered something from when I was around 4. My dad was cheating on my mom and for whatever reason kissed his lover outside of the car while me and my sister (1) were in the backseat. At that age I had no idea what was going on but later I casually said to my mom something along the lines of 'Daddy's got a new lady!'. It lead to a very difficult divorce. I blame both of them, for cheating and fighting right in front of me and my sister. I think I punished myself for making my parents break up and subconsciously decided that talking too much is dangerous and this might be the reason I developed social anxiety at a young age. I know it's not my fault but what if hadn't been a dumbass and just kept that one sentence to myself. How much better could my life have turned out.

Something positive to end this depressing post: I'm grateful for my friends and I will try my absolute hardest to keep them and not distance from them. I'm also glad I finally discovered all this about myself while there's still so much life ahead of me.",1764009591.0,socialanxiety

I went to an all girls middle school so I literally didn’t talk to any guys my age for over three years. When I moved to a co ed high school I suddenly found myself seeing every guy only as a potential romantic interest instead of just another person. I don’t know why but it just happens automatically.

I’m totally fine in group conversations, but the moment it becomes an one on one interaction with boys I get really uncomfortable and want to leave. What’s weird is that I’m completely normal around my gay guy friends whether it's a group chatting or not.

There were actually a lot of guys I genuinely liked as people and wanted to be friends with but because of this weird avoidance, I couldn’t get close to them. Some of them even approached me first and I wanted to talk too, but I always ended up pulling away.

Maybe this happened because I grew up in an all girls environment & my idea of “boys” was basically shaped by rom-coms, dramas, and novels. So when I actually met real teenage boys, I didn’t know how to handle it. I thought time would fix it but it's already passed almost 3 hears in high school and things barely changed.

I don’t even care about dating right now. I just want to get along with everyone regardless of gender but I can’t seem to get past this discomfort. It’s frustrating and I feel like I’m socially limiting myself.

I have a fairly new friend who twice now post-hangout I have texted them and apologized for something that felt to me like a huge misstep but then got a long paragraph back essentially saying “nope that didn’t bother me you are all good”. 

I want to take accountability and make things right when I feel like I’ve hurt someone’s feelings but because of my social anxiety I’m not a good judge of when that is necessary. And I don’t want to get into a pattern of consistently putting them into a position where they have to reassure me. 

I’ve been thinking of telling them something like “I’ve realized I have now reached out to you post-hangout twice and apologized for something I’ve said. Both times you responded with reassurance and that is super sweet and helpful but not my intention when I apologize. I want to make sure that I’m not unintentionally hurting you when we spend time together because I really value our relationship. I also want to make sure that you know if you are comfortable you are absolutely free to tell me if something I do or say makes you upset. I understand that me texting you after we hangout may get annoying and I was wondering if it would be better if I just waited for you to let me know if I’ve done something wrong rather than constantly trying to apologize proactively and putting you in a position where you have to reassure me.” 

I know that this also reeks of social anxiety but I am really struggling with balancing taking accountability and not apologizing every time I spend time with someone. Does anyone else feel this? Does anyone have any tips that help them discern when they actually did something wrong and when they are just overthinking? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

It made me wonder, if I were to invent smartglasses that quietly give live reminders during conversations things like:
“It’s okay to pause. You’re not being judged.”
“Nobody is watching you as closely as you think.”
 “Take a breath. You don’t have to perform.”
“A simple answer is enough.”
“You can take your time.”

And maybe even tiny optional prompts like:
“Ask a follow-up question.”
“You can end the convo politely now.”
“Look at their eyebrows instead of their eyes if eye contact feels too much.”

Or even directly remind us what to say, if we provide it with some context beforehand, so we don’t freeze. 

and potentially other features, such as post conversation encouragement, tracking the progress ( exposure therapy), analyze the body language of others, heartrate tracking? 

Do you think that would actually help?
Or would it make you more anxious knowing you’re relying on something?

1p5a9j7,Scared to engage in the mainstream,"
I dont have social media, I know vaguely of the trends right now, I dont really know that much other than roughly what people of my age are interested in. Like basically everyone else here, Ive felt deeply outcast. Because of that, and factoring in just how long its been, im scared to engage in the mainstream media, whats popular, all it does is remind me how disconnected I feel from everyone else around me, young or old. The sense of alienation, after seeing such things, makes my chest hurt. Which is hard to call a “sense”, because at a point I think you do just become alien. 

I purposely avoid it now. I dont want to be reminded of how much ive failed. If I even catch wind of one specific new thing, or the plot of a new movie, Ill feel awfully ashamed.  Anyway, I hope theres someone out there who reads this and understands this feeling and feels less weird about it. 

And last thing. In ten years time, deep in your soul, will the alienation ever leave? Is it really threaded into the fabric of your soul, the way it feels like it is? One day, I hope we will all be freed. ",1763967327.0,socialanxiety

1p56wr1,"Learning to Overcome Social Anxiety, Feeling Behind, and Losing My Personality","I know people commonly talk about this on this sub, but I’m pretty sure my social anxiety is contributing to me feeling behind in life. I just got off a call with my high school friends - we were catching up and talking about their time at college. A lot of them frequently go out, have close friends to hang out with, get into relationships, and overall have no problems forming connections with new people.

I, on the other hand, am an introvert who usually spends weekends inside and struggles to form solid relationships with the people around me. I don’t necessarily have a huge problem with being introverted, but it would be nice to have people to do fun things with on the weekends. However, it’s very hard for me to get close to people because I’m an overthinker and maybe a little too self-aware. Whenever I try to connect with others, like by talking about my interests or hobbies, I feel like I’m met with blank stares or far less enthusiasm than I show them. It makes me feel like they’re not truly interested in getting to know me.

It doesn’t help that, in college, people tend to see me only as a career-driven academic and nothing beyond that. I also don’t really fit into any of the groups I’m part of. This has caused me to change myself so much to appease whoever I’m talking to that I’ve started to lose my personality and sense of who I am. I feel like I have to act like a character to avoid being perceived as “weird” or “boring.” Because of this, I’ve stopped reaching out to people - platonically or romantically - out of fear, and I’ve continued to isolate myself.

I’ve started to peel away from these feelings a bit this semester, but after that call, some of them resurfaced, and I’ve been feeling a little lost again. It’s been really hard working through these emotions, and even though comparison has set me back a little, I still feel like I can continue moving forward.

I recently attended a session through one of my campus organizations that talked about feeling lost or losing your personality as being an opportunity to redefine who you want to be. It was one of the most inspirational things I’ve heard, and it motivated me to keep moving forward instead of getting stuck in anxiety.

I’ve made a promise to myself for the rest of this year and next year to be bold about my interests, to stop overthinking every little interaction, and to reach out to the people I genuinely want to connect with. I’m reminding myself that I’m my own person and my life doesn’t need to compare to anyone else’s. Even though it’s easier said than done, I’m going to keep striving toward that goal.

I just wanted to share my journey with all of you :)

  
tl;dr**:** I’ve been struggling with social anxiety and feeling behind compared to my friends who easily form connections. I often feel misunderstood, isolated, and pressured to change myself to fit in, which has made me lose touch with who I am. But after attending an inspirational campus session, I’m working on being more authentic, reaching out to others, and redefining myself without comparing my life to anyone else’s. I’m still learning, but I’m committed to moving forward.",1763956168.0,socialanxiety

1p54xrg,Stuttering is slowly turning me into someone I don’t recognize,"
I’ve been dealing with stuttering for years, and I can feel it slowly reshaping parts of me I never wanted to lose. There are moments when I’m completely fluent—when I’m alone, talking to younger people, or late at night—and in those moments it feels like nothing is wrong with me at all. But the second I’m around people my age or anyone I want to sound normal with, everything inside me freezes. My chest tightens, my heart starts racing, my breath gets stuck, and even simple words feel impossible to push out.

What hurts is that this doesn’t reflect who I am. I’m not quiet, withdrawn, or afraid of people. I actually enjoy talking and connecting, but the stuttering keeps dragging me into a version of myself that feels smaller and more distant every day. It’s exhausting trying to act okay on the outside while fighting my own body just to say basic things.

I am often in the clouds and my anxiety makes me freeze up and not be able to respond/convey what I wish I could, what i feel in my heart, how I want to affect people around me positively. I have a moment where I feel overwhelmed, or simply drifting for a moment, and I see people notice and their eyes narrow or a look of knowing flashes in their eyes. And I know that the hole inside of me is visible, i am not interacting the way i am socially expected to in that moment. Then that moment of not being present turns into complete withdrawal, my body is ridden with fear and frozen, and I cannot think or speak. My fear makes me come off as apathetic but I do care, deeply... peering through the windows of my mind. I have a couple friends see who I am beyond my anxiety. But I feel like I fail them because they want to connect with me and im so scared of letting everyone down that i come off as disingenuous. And for the rest, What I am capable of becomes lost as the moment for connection passes by me, and some assume I am inept. I dont want to be treated as if im different, but I am. I wish I could respond quickly or catch that social cue. I wish I could hold my head high and know who I am despite judgement. I sense people's pity for me, for missing out on the opportunities to connect. Ive been slipping and Im so scared ill always feel this way.

And like, I was just chit chatting away with her so it felt so natural and not like myself, but I mean that in the best way possible. I have ideas on what I can say to them, I can show them the horse I bonded with over the summer, tell them my stories of going to California, and I’m going to try to be myself even if it makes me feel weird sometimes.

1p515oe,Advice or opinions of my Anxiety,"Hey guys, first of all wanted to say thank you to anyone who actually ends up reading this long paragraph lol and for any advice. I have been on a long journey for a while to try and reduce/manage social anxiety(Age 15-Current 25). I have tried so much including in person therapy for a couple of years, online therapy, group therapy online. Worked on deep breathing, refocusing the mind, etc. Also have tried many different meds that have made zero difference(adderall, lexapro, Wellbutrin, escitalopram, atenolol, and a couple others). Have been diagnosed with social anxiety since age 15 and Generalized anxiety disorder since age 24. And major depression at 17 I think but who knows if that’s legit. However, I still feel the same pain and feel stuck. Watch a ton of YouTube videos and advice about how to be better and improve anxiety. Have exercised consistently, don’t eat too badly, don’t smoke or drink, sleep 8 hours a night. Tried to keep a couple of friends and force myself to be uncomfortable but it gets very hard to maintain relationships even close family. Every interaction is draining and sure sometimes I’m in the right mindset but, most of the time my mind is blank and I get worried about being exposed. Exposed for being and feeling really dumb. A lot of things that may be common knowledge, or are pop culture, music, directions, and more I have a lacking in understanding in and/or ability to communicate. My thought processing is slow and my memory is poor. People will talk about things with positive memories and I won’t know how to react without looking like an idiot. I hate the way people look at me(that im dumb). I want to make others happy and be able to contribute to conversation but I feel my awkwardness and overcompensation of feeling unintelligent(appears arrogant) makes people want to avoid me. Also, I unconsciously avoid people anyways so my mixed signals confuse others. People believe me to be selfish but I really want to be better to myself so I can’t be better to others. Im a people pleaser and am miserable if I can’t make others like me which is a big problem for an awkward person who wants to be social. I am also resentful of totters because interactions and talking and knowledge are so easy for them. I’m going to call a neurologist this week and do some preliminary testing to see if my brain is fucked up for any particular neural disorder or something. 

Anyone else have advice or something that worked for them with neurology??

Je ne sais pas trop par où commencer, mais j’ai besoin de parler à des gens qui pourraient comprendre ce que je vis.

J’ai 34 ans, et depuis que je suis enfant, je me sens en décalage total avec le monde. J’ai toujours eu un haut potentiel intellectuel, ce qui peut paraître “cool” sur le papier, mais dans la réalité, ça a surtout compliqué ma vie : trop de pensées, trop de lucidité, trop de sensibilité pour un monde qui avance trop vite pour moi.

Socialement, je suis presque handicapé. Parler aux gens, aller dans un bureau, faire des démarches… tout ça me déclenche du stress, de la transpiration, des crises d’angoisse. La société, les normes, les interactions forcées… j’ai toujours eu du mal. Je me sens bien seulement dans la nature, là où il n’y a personne, juste le silence.

Pendant des années, j’ai utilisé l’alcool comme béquille pour supporter ce malaise permanent. Je suis sobre aujourd’hui, mais la fragilité est toujours là. J’ai l’impression d’être usé avant l’heure.

J'adore voyager, je reviens de 3 ans passés en Australie, je bricole, j’apprends tout seul, je suis minutieux et doué de mes mains, mais je n’arrive pas à trouver ma place dans ce monde. Je me sens toujours à côté, comme un étranger même dans mon propre pays.

Ce qui me manque le plus, c’est simplement de rencontrer des gens qui comprennent ce ressenti :

le décalage, l’épuisement mental, la difficulté sociale, la sensibilité extrême, le sentiment d’être “trop” ou “pas assez”, et la peur constante de retomber dans de mauvaises habitudes juste pour calmer l’angoisse.

When I do presentations in front of the class, I go beet red, my eyes sting and I tear up, and my voice even quivers. I literally burn.

There is an old friend that I want to reconnect with. 

For some context, we were besties (both female), had a lot in common but we both had expectations from the other and we didn’t took the time to talk about it. A mutual friend was the one that helped us understand each other pov.
I went through a lot emotionally because of it and now it’s hard for me to get a new friendship because of trust issue, lack of connection and the feeling of being a bad friend. 
I really loved her and I never had a friendship like that…

2 days ago I finally sent her a text to ask if it was okay to talk and play again together (well, not only the two of us at FIRST but with a group of friends so it would be less awkward).
Which she said yes ! And I actually joined her discord server yesterday to play a bit with them !

But NOW, I don’t know what to do next ! I was just thinking of letting the time do the work and also try to calm myself about this fear and excitement for when we both gonna talk in private or whatever can happen when we both gonna be alone.

1p4nf2c,from social anxiety to extrovert in record time,"Hi everyone. I (M21) found a way to use exposure in the most efficient way for myself. I’m not a therapist, nor do I know exactly how exposure therapy is supposed to work. But for comparison: I know someone who does exposure therapy with a therapist, while I’m doing it on my own. The difference in our progress is so huge that it almost feels inhuman. While he is still struggling to talk to people, I’m already able to do the opposite and talk freely to people I know and don’t know. My method might be a “solution,” though of course it might not be for everyone.

Background: Just so you can imagine how far I’ve come: I grew up with social anxiety since kindergarten or even before. Later I was diagnosed with dependency issues, depression, and social anxiety. I went from being scared that someone might stare at me while I was outside, to talking to people in groups with confidence. This also helped my depression a lot because the social anxiety — or rather the low self-worth — was one of the triggers. I feel way better now, as if I don’t have depression anymore. I’m still grinding, but the progress is real, and I’ve received a lot of positive feedback. It might seem inhuman, but it is possible. I’m not trying to brag — I want to spread hope that it is possible. This isn’t small progress; it’s huge. I know how it feels to live in fear, and that’s why I want to help others feel more free and less trapped.

Disclaimer: This process requires discipline, bravery, consistency, and the ability to look into yourself honestly. That’s all you need. You don’t have to start with high self-esteem — you can start from very low. The more you push through, the more progress you will feel day by day or week by week.

Note: It’s a process. Write down every success at the end of the day, or share it with someone you trust. It really helps in the beginning. It doesn't matter how small the success is — recording it gives you the power of feeling one step closer to independence.


---

The high art of self-regulation

Exposure alone is not enough — you must constantly regulate yourself while feeling the fear.

I repeat: you have to regulate yourself CONSTANTLY while feeling the fear. Otherwise, exposure won’t reach its full potential.


---

How to do it

Whenever you enter any social situation — going outside, shopping, talking to someone you know or don’t know — you should regulate yourself using certain sentences. You can adjust them; they aren’t golden rules. I created them to stabilize myself when I feel fear.

Important:

Whenever you feel avoidance, do the opposite and use the sentences. Avoiding only makes it worse. No matter how small or big the avoidance is — do the opposite. That’s the best way to build self-esteem.

You don’t just read them — you must feel them. Writing them down helps a lot. When I think of them, they relax me — the fear, the sweating, the worries. You can say them out loud or read them in your mind. If it doesn’t work, take out your phone and read them slowly and carefully to strengthen your self-worth.


---

Motivational sentences describing your characteristics

For me, for example:

""I radiate positivity with my natural way, my smile, and my presence. Nothing can stop me, so I stay exactly as I am.""


---

General sentences

When I realize it’s okay to be who I am, all the sadness disappears.

No fear of talking.

Actively talk. Self-worth is built actively, not passively. Don’t wait for reactions — take action yourself.

Less analyzing, because the need for control is the root of insecurity in large groups. I need to switch it off or reduce it.

Stay myself without pretending. That way I don’t lose energy — I gain it.

When I stay myself, I feel no fear.

Don’t overinterpret things like silence or blank stares — they can have other reasons and are not about me, and definitely not tied to my self-worth.

If someone is truly unfriendly, it says more about them than about me. It does not define my self-worth.

If someone seems harsh but doesn't mean it, I should question whether it’s actually directed at me.

Focus more on my body sensations and less on the environment — that reduces fear and increases confidence.

Don’t wait or hope for attention (even when I’m alone). Don’t think about how it comes across — that’s just overanalysis.

Redirect thoughts and remind myself that I don’t depend on attention — my self-worth comes from within.

Redirect thoughts when I wonder how something might have come across, so overthinking doesn’t take over — neither from me nor toward me.

My self-worth is independent of other people’s reactions.

Don’t imagine or simulate future social situations. Stay in the here and now to avoid triggering fears.

If the other person doesn’t laugh or smile, it doesn’t reduce my self-worth. There could be many reasons. It says more about them than about me.

The insecurity about whether something came across weird, or whether it's quiet because of me, or insecurity when alone or around people — all of that is only a projection of my own fear. It’s not real — it’s an illusion.

Even when I feel watched or judged, it's just a projection of how insecure I feel about how I’m being seen. I can act or speak naturally. I’m allowed to be myself. These feelings of judgment are only projections.

Every kind of social fear happens only in the mind. It’s all a projection.

When I say this to myself and apply these tips, the fear goes away.

When the body tenses up, relax it and do a projection check.

When I feel avoidance, consciously do the opposite.

Don’t question what I said or wrote afterward. Leave it as it is. Keep my self-worth anchored within me.

Short version for quick boosts

1. EVERY FORM OF SOCIAL ANXIETY AND WORRY IS ONLY A PROJECTION AND THEREFORE NOT REAL. WHEN I EXPOSE IT, THE FEAR DISAPPEARS.


2. STAY IN THE HERE AND NOW — NO RUMINATING OR ANTICIPATING.


3. BE MYSELF. SELF-WORTH COMES FROM WITHIN, NOT FROM OUTSIDE.


4. NO REACTION FROM OTHERS — WHETHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE — AFFECTS MY SELF-WORTH. IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THEM, NOT ABOUT ME.

Most used sentences

I tell myself:
""This is just a projection.""
or
""I’m projecting again.""

Then the fear becomes so small I barely feel it — or it disappears completely.

This should reduce physical symptoms if you feel the meaning behind it. Every social fear you feel is only a projection. Everything you fear is what you think, not what is real.

Take a short deep breath, focus visually on one point, and say:
""This is just a projection. The fear in my body is only an illusion created by the brain.""


---

If someone is unfriendly

""If someone is truly unfriendly, it says more about them than about me, and it definitely does not define my self-worth.""


---

When feeling low

Use motivational sentences about your characteristics:

*individual characteristics as being positive and so on just like above*

and

""When I realize it’s okay to be who I am, all the sadness disappears.""

The purpose is to strengthen your inner core and not rely on external validation.

Start with the long version and gradually switch to the short version as it gets easier. If you have a relapse, just use the instructions — it will get better. Eventually, you can feel self-esteem without needing the sentences at all. I’m slowly moving toward that step, but I still need to consolidate this new, safer state.

I just realized that making myself small or feeling a need for attention — for example, downplaying myself — is also an indicator of a projection of low self-worth. So when you feel needy or want to be noticed, redirect your thoughts to your own self-worth and tell yourself that it’s just a projection — that you don’t actually need to be seen, because self-worth comes from within.

It’s better to use the sentences with your individual characteristics and remind yourself that you’re not dependent on attention from others.

It’s possible to feel drained after a full exposure session. That’s why I still recommend taking time for yourself. For example, I watch funny videos that lift my mood after exposure, and I feel better than ever. This serves as a kind of cooldown or reward.

Note: Before posting this, someone gave me a downvote here in r/social anxiety. I felt bad at first, then I told myself this is just a projection — it says more about the person who downvoted me and doesn’t affect my self-worth.

It would be easier to explain this in person, but I’ll gladly answer as much as I can. I wrote this quickly, so it’s long — but hopefully helpful. If you’re interested, I can improve it even further; just let me know in the comments. I am from Germany btw",1763906436.0,socialanxiety

1p4mrcf,I've been away from my phone because I'm too afraid to answer texts,"This is my old phone that doesn't have the usim. So it mostly has old accounts I seldom visit unrelated to my real life which makes it easier to open.
 My social anxiety has gotten so bad after being hospitalized and then catching the flu in this semester, which led me to socially isolate myself physically from others. This made me interact with other people in my university through group chats, since I had long term projects for this semester. It was horrifying to be asked to talk in group meetings, get assigned tasks to do, being yelled at one point because the guy was stressed and I haven't been doing my share of work due to my health issues. 
Now I keep avoiding looking at the chats at all costs even if it constantly lingers in my mind. I have nightmares about social interactions and because of the flu, I couldn't tell which part was real or not. But even the curiosity can't force me to open up the chat app without panicking. I haven't had panic attacks for almost a whole year before this semester. But I come too close to it whenever I have to open my phone since it shows the chat notifications. It might have been due to stress but it took me one whole week to get rid of the flu. Now I feel guilty for taking some time and workload off during that whole week when I previously promised people I would do things(I didn't know my flu would get this bad). Then avoiding opening the chat even when now I am healthy. 
Now I am just avoiding my phone as much as possible and I'm even possibly missing my bf's, family's or my friend's texts. Attempts of opening my phone just spirals me into a panic attack without any prescribed benzos. I have a month left for this semester with a bunch of projects and the finals. I am just breaking down but I don't have time to fix myself. I don't know what to do in this situation

My therapist is a very elderly British woman (just to give you a picture), and I have to say, I am stressed out in anticipation of every session. I just feel like she doesn't understand social anxiety. She keeps saying how ""easy"" talking is and that I 'just need to get over it.' I'm trying, I really am, I want to talk but I just need to learn how to do it without freaking out. She also says I'm making things harder for myself, and I know that, but that's my whole goal; find coping skills so I can make it easier on myself and talk like a normal person. She isn't offering up many coping skills, if at all, and says I just need to do it. It just frustrates me because I want so badly to 'just do it,' but I need help working through these thoughts.

I have a bunch of people I’m acquaintances with but it only really extends to small talk whenever we happen to run into each other. I do appreciate them but it’s hard to not feel lonely when all ur connections are just surface level. I’m fine with being alone occasionally but I crave friendship; alI want is just a friend who I can text and hang out with

It’s really demotivating cuz I feel like I’ve been putting in so much effort in trying to get closer to ppl but none of them seem to want to reciprocate. Whats even worse is that I feel like it’s my fault that they don’t, because whenever I did end up hanging out or eating with someone, I would just be so awkward and quiet that I feel like I’m just boring them and wasting their time, which ends up pushing them away. They end up gravitating away from me and towards people they actually do want to be around. I never get invited to plans, I get left on delivered/seen all the time, and all my friends just seem to have closer friends they consider to be their ‘actual’ friends.

Idk what to do because I feel like I’ve been doing all the right things to make friends— joining clubs, talking to ppl in my classes, reaching out to ppl, and js taking any opportunity I can to meet ppl but all I can get are just a bunch of acquaintances who don’t seem to want to put in the effort into building a stronger relationship with me after they get to know me. It’s hard cuz SA completely erases my personality, so people think I’m boring, but I need to be closer to people in order for me to be more comfortable being myself.

I sweat through all antiperspirants I have tried and it’s driving me crazy, giving me even more social anxiety of a result because of fear of smelling or something. There’s also times where I feel uncomfortably hot (hot flashes). I should add that I don’t FEEL my anxiety, for a long time I had no idea that I had anxiety, but it’s there.

I wanted to share something that happened to me recently.

I’ve had diagnosed social anxiety for about five years. It’s been better at times and worse at times, but lately it’s been really bad. I’ve been unemployed for a while, I feel extremely uncomfortable in my own body, and I’ve honestly developed a kind of hatred toward people. I spend most of my time in my room.
One of my more functioning friends thought it would be good for us to go out and do something. Somehow we ended up buying tickets to a “datenight” party - mostly as a joke. I wasn’t planning on meeting anyone. She was more motivated, and I had never been to a club before. I’m in my early 20s and she’s 20.

I thought, what’s the worst that could happen?

(We also agreed that if one of us found someone they liked, the other one could stay or leave and no one would be upset - just so nobody ends up feeling like the third wheel.)

When we arrived, we immediately realized the age range was completely different from what was advertised. It was supposed to be 18-30, but there were lots of people in their 30s, 40s, and older. We were definitely the youngest ones there. That already made me really tense.Once we were inside, I hated everything... the music, the people, the atmosphere. It was like a completely different world to me. And then, within the first five minutes, my friend left me alone to go after the first guy she saw. So I sat in a corner for like 20 minutes feeling like an alien in a movie. The noise, the lights, the people I felt disgusting and totally out of place. I knew she wasn’t going to come back, so I searched the whole club until I found her in some hidden room, cuddling with a guy she had just met.I told her I was leaving. She didn’t understand at first, but eventually she followed me outside. I explained how awful the whole situation felt and how she basically abandoned me. She said she “told me she might take longer,” but what does that even mean? Was she coming back? Was she not? She didn’t think about it at all.

We went home after that.

I’m in therapy, and I keep being told that it’s important to face your fears and put yourself into uncomfortable situations. But for me, it feels like the opposite. It doesn’t help, it just makes things worse. It’s a huge stress factor. I avoid people as much as possible, but forcing myself into situations like this doesn’t make anything better either.

I feel paralyzed and can’t do anything to get rid of my social anxiety (and the trauma that caused it). I really don’t see any way out other than suicide. 

How am I supposed to get better when I don’t have he willpower to do anything? How am I supposed to do exposure therapy when I’m too scared to even do the smallest bit of exposure?

Now obviously that's not literal but growing up I have been teased, scoffed at, disregarded, harshly critized, roasted for my appearance and features I cannot feasibly change, shamed for my quiet personality but also shamed for trying to be social. 

No matter where I am I always have felt this feeling; my entire life. Even me being unattractive and super little affecting my anxiety takes second place to this feeling. 

I understand that in society people all go through their own crap and it may make them miserable but it doesn't help that it seems like lots of people in public are unempathetic and careless and spite-filled.

I have a new friend who I have only known for about 7 months. I met her at the bus stop as we took the same bus initallly. She is going through a lot (moved to a new city, racism at work, escaping an abusive relationship and raising a 3 year old daughter on her own). I could see that she needed a friend, and so I stepped in to help. I helped her move to a new apartment, i took her and her daughter out to a show and dinner, and I also went over to their new apartment and made them both breakfast. I thought things were going well, until, welll, they weren't.

One day this new friend of mine was very agitated, yelling and taking her frustrations out those around her. She became cruel,  dismissive and she was shouting. I became scared of her and so did her daughter. I felt so uncomfortable, that I decided that I wanted to leave early, and she rolled her eyes at me, and I could just sense a lot of hostility being directed at me. I thought this was really crazy behaviour, especially after everything that I had done for her. Ever since this day, I have been dreading having to see or speak to her again. I might be more sensitive than others as I am an introvert with cptsd and avoidant attachment.

She has been calling and texting me for a few days and it took me awhile to respond. She invited me over to her daughter's birthday party. I texted back that my father broke his hip and is waiting for surgery (which is acrually true) and that my mental health hasn't been great and that I need to prioritize my self-care. And then I blocked her number because I am quite frankly terrified of her and I never want to see her again

Probably not handled very well, admittedly, but I would appreciate your opinion and insight into this. What would you have done?

Thanks

1p40jpg,"✨ Social Health Week 48: Presence, Vulnerability & Turning Points ✨","Chat GPT Crafted Dan Page Edited

This week, I’ve been reflecting on social health — not just casual connections, but the deeper kind: presence, authenticity, and being truly seen. Life gets heavy. Trauma, stress, and loss can quietly build walls, yet sometimes the smallest moments spark profound change. 💛

I’m reminded of Anna Kendrick in Pitch Perfect, standing on stage, heart racing, facing fear head-on. Real presence demands bravery — in a conversation, a coffee, or a community event. Elon Musk reminds us to take the first step, even when unsure. And Charlie in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory shows the power of noticing the magic around us while staying humble and authentic.

Week 48 Social Goals:
1️⃣ Isolation 🕊️ — Show up fully: Attend one event and have a 2–3 minute undistracted conversation. 🌟
2️⃣ Fear of Vulnerability 💔 — Share one genuine thought or feeling with someone you trust. 💎
3️⃣ Community Drift 🌍 — Reconnect with one person for a short, intentional check-in. ☕🤝
4️⃣ Emotional Exhaustion 😓 — Choose one energizing social interaction and skip one draining one. ⚖️💛
5️⃣ Misaligned Energy ⚡ — Spend 30 minutes in a space that uplifts your energy. 🌿✨

Unified Week 48 Intention:
“I will have one meaningful, undistracted conversation — showing up authentically, protecting my energy, and choosing connection over isolation.”

Channel the courage of Anna Kendrick, the boldness of Elon Musk, the wonder of Charlie, and the guidance of mentors and moments that shaped you — Erika Kirk, Kalin Blanchard, Blue 35, Emily. Small acts become turning points. Social health isn’t about being more social — it’s about being more present, more real, more alive. 🚪💛

They shriek, wail, scream, and moan so loud that I can hear them on the other side of the apartment with headphones in and the door closed. 

They just got together 4 months ago and moved in here together 2 months ago (I think it was like their 7th week anniversary). I moved in a little later and wasn’t overjoyed at the idea of living with a couple but I was too desperate to have a choice. I think it must be both of their first times being in a relationship or living on their own, before that they were living at his parents house. 

They go at it like rabbits and shriek constantly no matter what they are doing. On weekends they wake up around 11am and around 11:10 I start to hear noises from their room, which goes on and off all day until the evening and sometimes goes to the bathroom too. On weekdays they do this in the evenings, shrieking in ecstasy, wailing and moaning. She also makes high pitched baby noises and meows and growls, he screams with joy and also takes breaks to scream at his video games. 

Yesterday I was in the bathroom loading my clothes into the washing machine (yeah our apartment is really small) and through the closed door, shower and machine running, AND being hard of hearing, I could hear every single word they were shrieking in their room. My lease ends in a little less than a year, but even getting to the next day feels insurmountable. I feel like i can’t just keep going like this without speaking up, but I don’t know how.

Each time the noise becomes unbearable I knock at their door or send a text and ask them to keep it down, and they’re like “hmm ok” and it will happen again a few hours later. I feel so anxious walking up to their door, knocking and asking them to do their roleplaying and screaming less loudly. I’m trying really hard not to be so conflict averse, but its so difficult. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation and have any advice or insight? How do I try to communicate and set expectations about this sensitive topic without making it seem like i’m intruding on their personal lives? ",1763834797.0,socialanxiety

1p3yeo8,The fear of personal/personality related questions is what gets me most,"I've had social anxiety for a long time and recently it's been better overall but there's one main thing that makes it so that I can never ""advance"" past a certain point - the fear that if I get even slightly closer to someone they will ask something more personal and just can't deal with that.

I just have this fear of being judged so I hate sharing anything personal about myself (favorite movie genres, favorite good, favorite games, hobbies, etc.) and this is one reason why I avoid conversations as I really don't want to be asked any of this. This is why I feel slightly more comfortable when I talk to someone that I know won't ask me anything like that.

I'm mostly more comfortable on Reddit but this fear is so deep that I'd barely feel comfortable sharing any of that even here.",1763831230.0,socialanxiety
1p3xhm3,I went on another date and it surprisingly went so well.,"Today, I tried going on another date. At first, I was so skeptical, nervous and really scared because the date location was a bit unfamiliar to me. It was like, really unfamiliar which scared me more. I had to apologize to the driver so many times. 

Fortunately, I reached the destination. He was there, waiting already. I  thought to myself ""screw it, I'm just going to be myself this time who cares if I nervous laugh and stuff."" 

That thought helped me soooo much. We talked so many things, giggle. And surprisingly, he was a talker, and as a listener, THAT WAS SUCH A GOOD THING FOR ME. 

The location was really cozy, not much people around which probably helped me feel at ease. 

We talked a lot about experiences, preferences and stuff. Unlike the first guy I went on a date with, his questions were so subtle. I didn't even notice them. Not so invasive but you could still get to know the person. 

After we ate, we went for a walk which was really nice. Spent a bit of a time at a lobby and talked more. I giggled so much not because of being nervous but I was genuinely enjoying the time. 

Then we went to his place. Surprisingly, he was so repsectful and nothing more happened than talked, giggle, a bit of cuddles per se. He's huggable and I really liked that a lot. 🤣. We talked more. We both enjoy the same interest which has helped me a lot. 

He booked a cab for me and I got home safely. 

We both then agreed that we can freely explore more dates. I am really glad for tonight.

I was thinking about a lot of the problems I have with myself and I realized that they almost all stem from my lack of confidence. I was going to write two different posts, one about how most people don't treat me as an equal them or as if I'm a kid, and another post about how it hurts that I've never dated anyone or have been asked out by anyone. I tried to think of reasons of why this could be, an example being because I'm a very short male (5'1) despite being 18 but then, how come my friend who's just barely taller has a girlfriend? I thought about it and he seems to be much more confident. I thought maybe it's because I don't look ""attractive"" but then, how come other people who aren't very ""attractive"" are in relationships? Because they are confident. My confidence used to be much much worse years ago but it's gotten a little better as I accepted the fact that I'm super short and I've also started going to the gym for about two months now. These do help but I'm still not a very confident person. I've been described as a ""passive"" person who doesn't stand up for himself, so that should give you an idea of my personality a bit.

I’ve made progress over the years, overcome many social challenges by basically forcing myself to face them over and over again. But still, I have to do mental gymnastics every time I do any socializing that’s out of my comfort zone. 

I’m constantly trying to mask, so it’s hard not to beat myself up after any interaction that revealed any nervousness or awkwardness.
But when I feel I’ve really blown it, it’s so hard not to feel completely destroyed. I carry so much shame as a result. 

And no one ever understands of course. 

I’m hyper aware of everything, even when I dont want to be. I notice when people perceive me as “weird.” How they avoid me or immediately feel awkward having a conversation with me because they can sense my nerves. I can understand it may be a biological response to feel uneasy around a human that is displaying anxiety for no apparent reason but it still hurts deeply.

I’m tired of feeling like there’s something wrong with me.
I’m tired of feeling rejected. 

I’ve done so much to try to overcome this.
exposure therapy has helped me progress the most and I take beta blockers to manage the physical symptoms. I’ve also tried behavioral therapy, plant medicine, kava, yoga, and breath work which have all offered some relief, but only to a certain extent.

1p3mp59,Do I have social anxiety? Or do I just hate the thought of being embarrassed?,"So basically I'm a student and I absolutely hate going out. Everytime my friends ask to go out Im always thinking about how I look, because frankly I don't wear the most amazing things since I'm not exactly rich. My outfit most times is probably less than my friends scuffers hoodie. 

I also hate going out with family, getting caught at maccas with my entire family of 5 is my worst nightmare and it doesn't help that while I don't wear the gets things, my family dresses even worse. The area I live around is a pretty rich area and is full of people I know and I get so much anxiety everytime my mother tells me to take my siblings to the library or go for a walk. 

Now I'm not sure about this but I feel like I get really anxious about going outside with and without my family bc of my ethnicity. I wouldn't say my country is completely racist but quite a few people are very hostile or judging towards Asians (my ethnicity). I have had so many in counters where I will go out with a parents or by myself and hear people yelling out racist jokes or pulling their eyes back at me. I always get back home and just cry for like an hour in silence in my bed afterwards. 

Off topic but I also feel like I have a irrational fear of men/boys. Especially guys my own age. It might not just be me but I literally run the opposite direction whenever I see a guy that's my age, it definitely doesn't help that I go to a all girls school so I haven't socialized with guys my age in like 2 years aside from the occasional sorry in public or something. I also haven't had a crush yet. Is that weird? I feel like I'm so behind in life, socially.

1p3lxzi,Can you be an extrovert with social anxiety?,"Hello! I am a 23 year old female and I am wondering if it’s possible to be an extrovert and have social anxiety?

For some context I love being social. I have no problem talking to strangers in public while waiting in lines and I am very quick to make friends. With strangers I follow a logic that I will probably never run into these people again and I have no connection to them thus their opinions on me do not matter. It makes it easy to just be me and I typically always leave those types of conversations feeling very positive.

What I struggle with is the people closest to me. I often have a fear that I’ve done something to upset others when I am in a group setting with my close friends. I often replay conversations and think back on my interactions to dissect what I said, how I acted, how the other person reacted, etc. Dud to these fears that I have done something wrong I often bring up to someone how I’m feeling and if they think I should apologize or if I am reading too far into things.

I am starting to realize that this tends to backfire a lot. What to me seems as me just asking a friend for advice on if I have done something to upset a friend in which case I will always take accountability and apologize or if I am being delusional as I know I can overthink things or not understand tone/jokes.

I’m wondering if anyone else feels this way and what strategies they use when these fears arise? Is there a strategy I can use to help me decipher if someone is truly upset or doesn’t like me (I struggle to tell in situations where it’s like my friends friend who is in the group but I’m not close with likes me or is just kinda in a position where we have to be around each other).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I really wanna work on not letting these feelings of fear and the crushing of “no one likes me, I said something stupid now their whole opinion on me is changed and I can’t go back” because a part of me knows it’s not rational I just don’t know how to stop it.

1p3jij1,Accepting myself to help ease SA,"I've been thinking lately, the more I know what I value, the more I will feel convicted in what role I will play. Then I can accept myself and what really matters to me, instead of always feeling like I have to brace and hyper adapt to the expectations of people I'm around. 

I've been thinking I want to learn to be a better friend to people- to go about my daily life feeling invested in those around me..not overly so, not controlling, but just enough to set myself up for the rejections that occur when I am true to my values. But I won't just be setting myself up for rejection, I will be setting myself up for genuine bonding too...

Tonight I read the Carl Jung quote 
""Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.""

Maybe if I give more attention towards figuring out what really matters to me, then my loneliness will decrease...I won't be as afraid around people because I will know who I am and am not...and I will have areas of common ground to bond with people through.

I'd love to hear your story if you've found accepting yourself has helped with social anxiety and the accompanying feelings of loneliness or alienation

1p3itxf,I find people boring and feel guilty for that.,"Hi guys. I wasn’t sure where to post this to get an opinion, so I figured social anxiety would be a good place, since I struggle with it too.

I used to think I was just a shy person, and throughout my life I’ve been working on improving my social skills. I always believed that the reason I had trouble making friends was simply because I was shy. But now that I’m getting better at socializing and even making “friends” more easily, I’ve realized that shyness wasn’t the only issue.

I find it really hard to be genuinely interested in other people, and I feel bad about that. Sometimes I keep friendships and hang out with people because I don’t want to feel like a bad friend, especially when the other person clearly likes me, even though the whole time I’m secretly wanting to go home.

It’s much easier for me to enjoy spending time with people in work or college settings, where there are tasks or activities to focus on. My interactions there feel fun, maybe because they’re quick and structured. But when it comes to going out just for fun, I usually don’t have fun at all. Unless I drink, but I’m not really a drinking person.

I’ve been planning a trip \*for months\*. Prepared a lot for it, read endless anecdotes from SA sufferers, and already booked, but I am so close to cancelling it.

I just can’t internalize how people successfully do that and even end up saying they loved it. I understand there’s levels to social anxiety, and maybe those with a lesser (not trying to diminish anxiety, just can’t think of a better word) form of SA are able to push through? Perhaps medication helps with that? I currently take no medication for my anxiety, for what it’s worth.

For me, stepping out of the house is a challenge. Being in public spaces with people would raise my self-consciousness to an insane degree, and the thought of talking to anyone or ’adulting’ alone in a foreign country sounds like an absolutely herculean obstacle.

It’s just demoralizing to me that I am hyper-ventilating so much. I am feeling nauseous so much.

1p38cbn,Trying to understand why I sometimes anger people.,"So I've been making some people angry for no apparent reason and I'm actually clueless. I'll provide some context.
I'm a 36 year old guy, I live in the Netherlands and have been diagnosed with ADD last year.
I've got a pending result for ASD with a high probability.
Most people describe me as a silent but chill guy who is not that outgoing.
I live by live and let live.

Since I've been diagnosed with ADD and have been taking prescribed medications (SSRIs and Amphetamines) I feel a whole bunch better. It does not fix everything but it makes it more bearable. I'm finally able to sort things out and get an understanding about who I am, what I do and why I do.
But there's one thing that keeps slipping my mind and it's driving me nuts.

I've had some people get mad at me, seemingly for no apparent reason. It happens to be mostly men between the age of 20 to 60 (about 95%). The other 5% is women between the age of 45-60. The frequency is about 5 to 6 times a year.

As an example I'm just sitting somewhere and they snap all of sudden. There's a whole bunch of variety in what action/reactions I get. Sometimes they do a little extra effort and come to me if they aren't in range. The simplest are dirty looks I can't really describe and mean regards about my physical appearance. In the worst case they get physical.
It happens at social gatherings, work and basically everywhere people are involved.

I've had complete strangers be hostile from the moment they lay eyes on me. Not a single word spoken or looks exchanged.

One thing that occurs a whole bunch more is that people from above mentioned sex and age range try to prevent eye contact. Like at the register in some store.

A little grab out of the box of things these people have told me:
- I'm vain.
- I'm provocative, as in I'm actively challenging them.
- I'm not that good looking.
- I'm a showoff.

In context of the things I've been called I can say I'm not actively trying to be any of those things.
- Basic hygiene is important but I don't really care about how I look.
- I really do not care about dick measuring.
- I never said I'm good looking.
- I'm just having fun. I'm not racing you, I'm racing myself.

I've been looking over everything and analyzing things but I'm actually stumped.
Tried talking to a therapist but no answer.
I've tried talking to people about it but no one seems to believe me.
Tried talking to someone that had been mean to me on work.
HR got involved. Afterwards we got to know each other better and are chill now and I thought I could ask the man why he got so angry.
Then he just said I looked mean. I could sense he was not being sincere with me.

So I'm kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Any ideas? Many thanks in advance.

EDIT:

Talked to some more people and apparently I give of vibes that I'm not a typical ""guy"" guy and can be perceived as misandristic. When there's actual contact it's mainly because I don't participate in the degrading/insulting humor.

I just don't connect or relate with them, and when around them I feel empty and like an outsider. I'm just there. In general, I think my wife can do alot better with friend choice. These people are very inconsistent, not always around and I wonder if they'd really be there for my wife in the hard times. 

 I try not to overstate this because I don't want my wife to be upset but I do speak truthfully and delicately on the subject. She just nods her head and says it'll be fun to hang out and it'll fly by but I still feel the way I do. I wish I didn't.

1p3412m,Im living in my nightmare,"I am living my worst nightmare, being the third roommate in an apartment with a couple. The apartment is AMAZING, best place i’ve ever lived. I moved in two months ago and last month my roommate had her bf move in with us and all they do is shriek hysterically and yell and flirt and squeal together for hours on end.

My roommate is the daughter of the landlady so obviously anything she wants to do will be allowed and they will take her side.

theyre also not doing anything wrong by being (loudly) flirtatious and intimate in their own room but I can hear it too well and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I think i’m hearing stuff like bed creaking, loud wet kisses, their foreplay and sometimes they don’t close the door all the way but even if they do, the walls do not protect me enough from those sounds. 

Every time I leave my room i have to check if the coast is clear and i’m suffering just hiding in my room listening to them shrieking hysterically and go googoogaga and baby talking and flirt-screaming (YOURE SO CUTE YESS YOU ARE YESS YOU AREEEEEEEE) 

Not only do i have bad hearing, i also hide in my room and close the door but i can still hear them because my room is unfortunately next to theirs. I’m typing this with headphones on but they are overstimulating and i can’t wear them all the time. 

This is the worst possible situation for me, but I don’t want to move out because before this happened it was my dream apartment and everything else about it is perfect. Also i cannot afford to live alone yet, as much as i would like to…

any advice for this situation ? ",1763744519.0,socialanxiety
1p33k3h,I am feeling down,"I’m a 21-year-old guy, and I’ve struggled with bullying for most of my life, especially in secondary school because I was overweight. Now I’m studying, and even though it’s a new environment, I feel like I’m still carrying the same wounds.

I usually sit alone in class because I have pretty bad social anxiety, and I can’t even maintain eye contact with people — it makes me feel tense and awkward. At the start of the year, I tried to socialize with a few guys in my class, but they immediately started making fun of me right in front of me. I got angry and moved seats to stay away from them.

Ever since then, one of them keeps coming up to me almost every day to say “hi” in this weird, childish way, like he’s mocking me or trying to make me feel stupid. It makes me feel uncomfortable and “not normal,” and it brings back the same feelings I had when I was bullied.

I’m tired of sitting alone every day.
I barely talk to anyone — I don’t talk to the girls in class at all, and I only speak to one person occasionally. I feel down, isolated, and honestly kind of stuck.

I’m not sure how to break out of this, work on my confidence, or deal with classmates who treat me like this.

1p31fuf,The day my grandmother passed away,"
Hello. My grandmother passed away the day before yesterday, and the news was a shock and completely unexpected for me. So I prepared myself and took two Inderal pills because I knew the day would be hard and long. At the beginning, I didn’t know how to act—what to say, how to express my sadness, how to console others, how to talk. I felt like a child who has no idea what to do. I felt like everyone was looking at me and judging me, so I got extremely anxious, and that anxiety completely overshadowed my sadness about her death. That was shocking to me.

Of course most of my relatives came, along with their friends. That’s when I realized I don’t really have any friends to comfort me—no one I know was there for me. The first day passed, and it was heavy. On the second and third day, I was expected to sit and receive people, like I’m the man of the family representing everyone. But I don’t know anyone. Some people talked to me with annoyance: “You don’t remember me? I tell you who I am every time and you forget.” I never know what to say. Someone responded on my behalf, telling them, “He’s not into social stuff, that’s just how he is.” And I felt embarrassed and guilty, like I’m being accused of not knowing anyone or anything.

A lot of people ignored me on purpose, as if I’m a little kid who doesn’t know anything, even though I’m 22. Honestly, when I compare myself to my colleagues, I feel like if the same thing happened to them, they would’ve handled it better than I did. I’m genuinely exhausted, drained, very anxious, and sadly the last thing I’m feeling right now—unfortunately—is grief for my grandmother.",1763738604.0,socialanxiety

1p305ii,How to reduce the impact of anxiety on the body,"I'm in my 20s, graduated from college this year, unemployed, staying home, and having no friends—which is fine with me. The problem is, I have trouble interacting with other people for long periods of time. As soon as I feel unsure of my words or actions, I blush (99% of the time), my hands start shaking, I automatically look away (I can blush if I make eye contact with someone, even my family), my head goes blank, and so on. I can force myself to ask a passerby something, buy groceries, or make a phone call (it's great that they can't see my shaking hands)—these are all short interactions, and I don't have time to get too scared.
But things like interviews, presentations, and long conversations—all of that is difficult.
My mind knows that none of this is fatal, but my body just doesn't listen and takes on a life of its own.

 The main thing that bothers me is that I periodically get chest pains from anxiety, probably due to my increased heart rate and adrenaline. This doesn't happen during stress, but after the situation is over. The pain comes in bursts, with a burning and stabbing sensation, and this can last for several days (the longest I've ever experienced was four days).
At these moments, I feel like I'll die of cardiac arrest faster than my social phobia goes away. This is probably the main reason why I avoid leaving my comfort zone, but unfortunately, it doesn't make the problem go away.

Has anyone else experienced this and can offer advice?

1p2z4rg,I overthink when talking to people,"My sister and boyfriend have noticed that sometimes when I am discussing with them about something, I tend to say it in a straight-forward approach or even an insensitive approach. That I can come off as aggressive or even rude. However with them, this issue has been dealt with, as I try to be more careful with how I speak and when something comes off the wrong way, we just discuss it and I explain to them with what I meant.

However, I have noticed that I have an issue of making friends or maybe not making friends, but having long lasting friendships? I don't have any best friends, nor even 'close friends'. The close friends I have made unfortunately are either online friends that I have met while gaming... and that's it. I recently had made a good friend who I would have called a best friend, but certain values of hers didn't align with me and I decided to cut ties with her.

Anyway due to this issue with me ""speaking aggressively or too straight forward"", I have slowly developed some bad social anxiety. Where I worry A LOT when I speak. Or after I am done talking to someone, I end up worrying a lot if I had said the wrong thing. 

I believe that I am friendly, outgoing and think before I speak (most of the time) but I am unable to make good long lasting friendships, and now not only am I bad at having good long lasting friendships but I have some pretty bad anxiety when I speak to people such as colleagues, strangers, etc.

1p2u34z,How to not look at people when you know they are staring at you?,"I cannot find it anymore but there was a good post on here saying that people who have social anxiety and get anxious from staring are looking for confirmation in each person that that person is staring. Something like your anxious mind is hyperaware of the probability so you look for “the look” in order to release anxiety bc you know for sure they are looking and you confirmed it, but it’s a loop bc you are still anxious about all the staring. They said you have to be comfortable with the uncertainty. This really resonated with me in just don’t know how to implement.

What are things you think in your head or methods you use to keep yourself from looking for the stare in others?

I live in a country where everyone looks different from me, so yes they are actually staring at me. And in the culture they already stare so it’s even heavier. They stare and often don’t break eye contact then they are caught, sometimes they even bend their neck to keep staring. In general living here and being in this interracial relationship (even prior to the move) has triggered a lot of social anxiety in me over the years to the point where i don’t want to go out sometimes bc I am always under surveillance by others.

1p2tj7k,The cure to your all your worrying is to stop thinking.,"That is not advice, but rather more a fact. Its truths do not lessen the burden of walking the path to see that for yourself. All socially anxious agree on this one principle, that all our attempts to master the world by means of overthinking about all the minutiae and trifles of life, end in failure. We do not achieve the world of certainty we demand, and we pay at every moment a price far too great for one to bear, rendered out of us in constant fear and self-loathing.

Though the way is dim, there is light, as I have found out for myself.

What prevents our capacity to regulate our minds in just proportion so that it works for us rather than against us? Why are we seemingly under constant threat of attack from all fronts? What pulls so tightly at our hearts and renders us so unworthy of standing equal amongst one another? 

All answers to these questions will bear themselves in the form of a thought, by means of a process of reflective self-awareness, in which we attempt to use the tool of thinking to come to a sound resolution. What are to be the fruits of such labor? What is gained in thinking except more thoughts? It stands to reason that the only outcome worth valuing is that which eventually moves beyond thoughts and into action, or nonaction, depending on how you do, or do not think about it.

What we desire is peace of mind and resignation from our perpetual battle with being human amongst humans. If we contend that our suffering is lessened by cessation of continuous reflective thinking, then what binds us to it so strongly?

Herein lies the truth of the matter. The struggle by which we persist in folly is rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of our self. If we analyze closely our socially anxious  self-identity, we find that it is  in large part defined by the judgments of others. That is to say, we allow ourselves to be in part defined by the myriad of opinions in which others might posses of us, opinions which we constantly seek to control or influence so as to reaffirm our own internal sense of self-image.

The result is a self-image that is like a castle, alone and vulnerable in a hostile world whose large walls are needed to keep others out.  Anyone who can pierce the defenses has a clear line of sight to all the vulnerabilities that lay at our hearts. We are destroyed in an instant if the others judgments are met without equal ground to make a stand on.  Thus, the judgments of others, or even just our beliefs of their judgments, comes to form the basis of our new self-image. In practice we give to others the keys to our self-identity, and we suffer in its defense. Being so open to attack and with so much at stake, it suffices to say that the socially anxious life is exhausting.

If this is the great error, that we have no firm ground by which to self-suffice, then what is our solution? To give the solution is to do injustice to the path which one must walk in order to see the virtue of such a solution. But I have already given it, in the cessation of reflective thinking. This is harder to do in practice, for our minds are built out of beliefs, forming complex worldviews stuffed with emotional baggage, and misguided by the non-values of society we have inherited and not reflected upon.  Not thinking calls into question our entire understanding of morality, self, others, and being itself.

Aristotle tells us that all virtues become vices in excess or deficit. Reflective thinking is a tool that becomes a crutch when overused. It can distort reality just as much as it can make it clear.

Self-awareness reveals an infinite hall of mirrors to one who takes it to its limits. It reveals a self that the more you try to understand it by thinking about it, the more complex it becomes. There is no stable ground in self-reflection. 

What is left when you stop thinking?

1p2ifwx,Public speaking and panic attacks,"M24, I’ve been suffering from panic attacks for about 12 years. It might sound absurd, but until a year ago, I wasn’t even able to give them a name—I didn’t know what was happening to me… I only knew they started from inside me and felt like electric shocks. At first, they were rare and limited to certain situations, so I pretended they didn’t exist. Then, 5 years ago, during my high school finals, I had the most terrible attack of my life, out of nowhere and for no apparent reason. It’s a moment I will never forget and that caused me immense embarrassment. Since then, I developed a constant fear of oral exams at university and a significant glossophobia. However, my desire to continue my university studies (which I really enjoy), along with being fairly ambitious and driven, meant that every time—for each exam—I just gritted my teeth and suffered for weeks, hoping I wouldn’t experience that awful moment again. I can’t deny that the anxiety, trembling, and heart palpitations often made me perform worse than I deserved… Sometimes I came very, very close to having another attack, but I always managed to avoid it.

Now, as I write this, there are 8 days left until my thesis defense, probably the day I fear most since I started university. Even 9 months ago, I would spend my evenings thinking about it before falling asleep. So, I decided to start psychotherapy. It definitely helped in some ways, but my fear has only softened a little. It’s still huge. I imagine that terrible scene on repeat at least 100 times a day: me feeling sick in front of all my friends and family… the nightmare returning with fifty times the intensity.

Honestly, I’ve even thought about taking an anxiety medication on the day, but I really don’t want to since I’ve never done it, wouldn’t know how, and it would feel like a point of no return for me. But maybe I need it, I don’t know. My therapist says I don’t.

I really don’t know what to do or think anymore. Apart from this burden I carry, all in all, I’ve had a happy and fulfilling life. But in 8 days, if things go badly, I might fall into a black hole that I don’t know if I can climb out of...just being honest.",1763680580.0,socialanxiety

They start to sigh, move around a lot, fidgeting when sitting at one place. You can feel the tension in the air, and you know it's because of your ""aura"". And the thing is that I'm not a rude person, I'm kind and everything but somehow I just make them act and feel uneasy. It may has to do something with my facial expressions bc I always show the people fear on my face and it makes people really uneasy. Then they start to rub their eyes when they look at me ..

And it's yeah, probably my aura bc when I'm not around and I look at the group from far away, they don't look anxious. But when I go among them and greet them they act weird, say hi but they doesn't really say anything, like they just keep quiet around me..  ",1763676001.0,socialanxiety

I think they hate me and now I can’t get this out of my head. what are the odds I run into them? I don’t think I will but now I’m scared I’ll get embarrassed in front of everyone.

1p2eeyi,How to manage anxiety in regards to difficult customers in retail?,"I work in a store that is very luxury focused, so you can imagine the customer base - uptight rich people who think they are entitled to everything they ask. this can sometimes make interactions very difficult, especially when i have to be firm with them or say something they dont want to hear. when this happens and they start to push back, i get the worst facial flushing (and im pale so its really obvious haha), i get the shakes, and i start stumbling over my words and my mind goes blank. its so embarrassing having to face someone like this, and i often end up getting lingering anxiety for the rest of my shift. in the past, this has caused me to make mistakes i would never otherwise make, and ive had hives break out across my entire chest and stomach that last for hours. 

with the holiday season coming up, the influx of people like this has me so anxious to go to work knowing i might end up dealing with these anxiety attacks. last year, i had a panic attack so bad that i had to go home, and it was so embarrassing, especially because i am in a management position so i am expected to be able to deal with this.

1p28x45,Trying to be part of my own life again,"So I’ve been realizing lately how much I basically disappeared from everyone’s lives without meaning to. My last job ate up all my time and energy long hours, constant stress and zero mental space for anything outside of work. I didn’t notice how much I’d pulled away from people until after I finally quit.  
  
The other day I ended up having this unexpectedly deep conversation with one of my closest friends. We were just catching up and it somehow turned into this honest talk about life, burnout and how much I’ve missed actual connection. It hit harder than I expected. Like when did I stop being part of my own social circle? Right after that he planned a little hangout at my place with a few of our closest friends. Nothing huge just a small low pressure get together so I could ease back into being social again. He even brought his cocktail maker and started making drinks trying new capsules while we all sat around the kitchen table, talking and laughing about the old days and catching up like no time had passed. And honestly it felt really good. Awkward at moments sure, because I still feel rusty and my brain is relearning how to be around people without overthinking every second. But it was warm and easy, and it reminded me that I actually like being around people when I’m not completely drained.

Also when my friend asked me if her voice was quiet when she presented, I told her it was but turns out it wasn’t because she asked another one of our classmates. We were seated in-front, I kinda just assumed how others heard it and now I feel bad. Im worried that she’ll think I’m trying to bring her down or something :(

Im so awkward all the time and I always just struggle with conversations. I can’t even focus on anything anymore, my bf of 2 years and 7 months broke up with me just 2 weeks ago, I loved him so much. I’ve been crying everyday and I broke down when I got home wishing I could call him and tell him about my day. I was so comfortable with him and I could talk to him about anything, he was my best friend. I was very lonely until he came along. He made me so happy and more confident in myself but now all my progress is just gone and my self esteem came crashing down. I considered just ending it all because I don’t really see any potential in me and I have nothing to live for anymore. But then he texted me earlier and said he will bring me gifts on my birthday in 2 days. Honestly, the only thing keeping me alive right now is hope that he will come back to me someday.

That is the question I had oscillated around my whole life.

People you trust, backstabbing you in the hard times, people going to any lengths unimaginable for power and money. 
All these keep reminding me to - be and turn evil and narsicistic. And having Social Anxiety makes survival even harder in this type of world.

I want to hope this is not the case and kindness and empathy do exists in the world but with every pasing day I am losing that hope.

1p1xe5n,Do I accept loneliness or strive for popularity?,"Please note: I (17F) don’t even have a small close knit group of friends, I don’t even have one CLOSE friend. I see and talk to people at school and go home.

Days in which I compare myself a lot, I’ll overthink a storm, make everyone uncomfortable by being awkward and responding inauthentically, and most importantly, I hate that I’ll miss the opportunity to make connections with people that I think are interesting and cool. I’ll end a week like this thinking I’m hopeless and I couldn’t continue with the current state of my social skills.
Now when I’m surrounded by not-as-popular-or-loud people that I think are funny and know won’t judge me (it’s a high standard for me not be scared of you), I won’t think so negatively and will have some sort of sense of self again. I’ll end a good week like this thinking socializing is so fun even if it doesn’t go well sometimes and I’m okay seeing others succeed with popularity…because for some reason, I would feel I’m as popular at the moment.

(YALL CAN SKIP TO THIS) So when it’s good, it’s good. but when it’s bad, it accelerates and I would end up feeling as though I’ve hit rock bottom. The issue is pressure, so if I would just learn to be okay being unpopular, I could get by making at least good small connections and be content. But, I can’t see it happening, I feel like it’s fair to worry with the point I’m at so how can I just act like I don’t care if I know the goal is to not worry so I can communicate better? For striving for popularity, I feel like one day of successful communication makes me more rational because I’m having more positive experiences that I can refer to to think more positively. I believe you can’t be positive unless you have proof of the statements you think.

1p1vpu9,How do you make friends as an adult?,"I’m in my mid-20s and work from home, so I barely meet people outside of work calls. Over the years I’ve lost many friends because life moved us in different directions. I’m happy in my relationship (we’re getting married in two years), but I still want a small circle of genuine friends.

My problem is that I seem to attract two types of people:

1. Those who trauma-dump on me because they sense I’m sensitive, empathetic, and kind.

2. Those who think I’m an easy person to take advantage of.

What they don’t realize is that I’m actually a strong person who knows my boundaries. I’ve stayed kind without losing my self-respect.that self respect also builded over the years after several bad experiences.i even faced lot of problems when it comes to something simple like splitting bills.if someone pays, I send my share immediately. But when I pay first, some people just don’t return their part. I used to think I was too shy to ask, but even when I did, they didn’t pay back. That’s become a huge red flag for me. I confront it softly, and if nothing changes, I cut them off.

Because of these experiences, making friends as an adult has become really hard. Even online it’s worse. I live in Bangalore, and when I posted on a subreddit looking for friends.clearly stating no NSFW, I’m happily committed, and just want to socialize. I still received inappropriate messages or assumptions that I’m looking for something else.

I don’t care about gender when it comes to friendship, but that doesn’t mean I’m looking for anything beyond friendship. I just want genuine people. Even convincing my partner about how important socialising.it is was easier than actually finding the right kind of people.

Right now, I honestly don’t know how to find “my type” of friends. When something happens repeatedly it means something going wrong it's either I have to change something or I am looking at wrong place..after all of these I am just confused...Any advice is appreciated.. ",1763618872.0,socialanxiety

1p1tz91,"Unable to maintain friendships despite being well-liked and charismatic despite my anxiety, I'm starting to feel very lonely. What should I do?","I grew up extremely isolated, being an only child with older immigrant parents and suffering from anxiety/depression for as long as I can remember. My mother is unstable and self isolates, and my dad is a bit of a loner, but approachable and charismatic. For this reason, I only ever formed friendships in my late middle school/high school years, and I was never able to properly maintain them. I also admit that I became somewhat picky, since the people I WAS able to befriend were often poorly influencing my decision making. This paired with my social anxiety made it hard to get past the ""you're fun to talk to, let's follow up"" stage.  
  
I learned whatever social skills I could, but still lack a few internal ones. However, I have been told by multiple people I trust, including strangers, that I am very approachable, kind, and enjoyable to be around. I am smart and attend a higher-end business school (it is a primarily commuter school, but I still see people with a lot of friends & friend groups), and I don't think it's related to my looks since I have been told I'm average/above average. I do have a slightly mad looking resting face.

People usually initiate a follow up meeting/hang out and reach out to me first, and I can tell they do enjoy talking to me. This is helpful since I panic and block out the idea of reaching out first, cause what if I misread the cues and they actually don't want to maintain a relationship you know?  
But that's where it always ends, I don't think it's anything I do specifically, but I'm lost. Is it cause I'm scared to reach out first? Or is there something else I'm missing?

I just feel very lonely, and it feels so upsetting that I am unable to make any friends, especially as a business student. All I have to look forward to is brief group projects cause that's the only time I'm able to talk to someone in a mostly carefree setting. 

It feels even more upsetting cause I am one of the most popular people in my grade because of an initiative I did at the beginning of the year/upon entry. I helped 400+ out of 900 students enter their first year smoothly, and had so many reach out to me personally to thank me and try to befriend me, but it just never went anywhere. I even tried pushing my nervousness aside and reached out first these few times, but it also never went anywhere.

I just don't know what I'm doing wrong, I feel so lost and I feel like I've reached a dead end

It feels like every couple hours or days, I switch who I have a problem with and hyper fixate on something that is not an issue, and turn it into one in my head. 

**Examples:** 

* I text a friend and she takes 2 hours to answer…so I spiral about whether she hates me and overthink and get extremely upset. She then replies and I am okay. 
* My focus then switches to another friend, who sent me a ton of texts asking for my advice and I hyper fixate on the fact that “she isn’t asking about me, she only cares about herself, she is talking about herself too much, etc.” 
* I reply and move on and then suddenly am newly hyper focused on the fact that a third friend of mine hasn’t reached out to out to me in a couple days and instead of being normal and just texting them, I overthink. 

Regardless of the situation, I am left feeling sad, upset, unliked, disconnected, etc. I KNOW that this is a deeper issue and that a one-off text exchanged has absolutely nothing to do with our overall friendship ….and it’s actually pathetic bc I am by no means the worlds nicest texter myself like I have been short, replied late, etc. and it’s never meant anything so why am I feeling this way?

I don't like interacting with anybody-- not even people that I like. SOMETIMES, I can be good at speaking. It is often about something like birds or music, but it is still nervous and unsteady.

  
I feel like I've also become more apathetic and prone to... Idk being unkind. I constantly feel like I'm being humiliated and looked down upon, and this makes me reactive. And sometimes, I think people MIGHT actually be looking down on me!!!

  
One time, a lady had grocery bags, but didn't put them up yet, so I began putting her items to the side. She kept making weird comments, which I ONLY UNDERSTOOD after she said, ""You're horrible"" (because I didn't bag her items). 

  
Another time, I asked about a lady's hat (while her receipt was printing) and she said it wasn't the time. IDK I was just trying to make conversation while the receipt was coming out, as they often get stuck. 

My family says that I am timid and shy. I suppose I'm disappointed that, what seemed to be A very obvious solution (more interactions) has NOT helped, and has in fact, exacerbated my feelings of social inadequacy.

I want to go out and do things. I am going to do community college in real life next quarter, as well as volunteer at the theater. But I am afraid it will be the same thing-- I go into it and freak out and go home and so on.

1p1hwc3,My experience with propranolol!,"Hello I just want to share my personal experience with propranolol because I feel like it could help someone out! I have social anxiety so so bad. It has gotten better as I’ve gotten older but it’s still pretty bad. Especially when presenting or just talking in a group bigger than like 6. The last presentation I gave was as a group PowerPoint, I talked for maybe less than one minute. I was swaying the whole time, my voice was shaky like I was going to cry. The presentation I just recently had to give was 15 minutes long and by myself. I couldn’t sleep the night before and when I would fall asleep I’d wake up with a high heart rate. Well morning of my presentation I woke up and my heart rate was running 130-145. I almost emailed my teacher to tell her I just couldn’t do it. I decided to go ahead and take 20mg of propranolol and trusted that it would work. I took it around 6:45 knowing my presentation was around 8:30-8:45. I calmed down some by around 7:20, it was around 80 or so which is great! I got to class at 7:30 and took another 10mg. By the time I walked into class I was feeling so calm. I know it’s not supposed to calm your thoughts but for me it does. I think with a calm body my mind is calm as well. While other presenters went before me I was still fairly calm with no negative thoughts. I was actually sweating profusely though, my water bottle could’ve slipped out my hand. When I went up to present my heart wasn’t beating out of chest, I wasn’t shaking, I could stand still, and my voice was smooth and steady. It was insane and I kept thinking “wow this is crazy”. I still talked a little too fast, my mouth was a little dry, and my thoughts still weren’t all the way there but I had basically my whole presentation and what I wanted to say memorized so I didn’t go blank or anything like that which was one of my biggest fears. I probably could’ve taken another 10mg but since my doc only prescribed 20 I didn’t wanna chance anything by adding 20 more.  So if you needed a sign to try propranolol this is it! 
Just do it! It can be life changing 

TLDR; propranolol gave me the ability to actually get up and present without having a panic attack.",1763581976.0,socialanxiety

the thing is yes, I understand the spotlight effect most of the time people don't care. but for me everytime I go outside I'm catcalled, people ask for my number, little girls compliment me or even worse some creepy guy approaches me and try to follow me. I remember when I was parked at a lot for a date with my talking stage and some guy started staring at us, and then that turned into an arguement between them too I was so anxious and the strange guy who was staring called me a ""b**** who think she's all that"" now me and my talking stage don't even talk because he claimed I was ""defending a stranger"" when I was just anxious so I told my talking stage to stop arguing with strangers. So I hate the spotlight effect because it's simply not true for some of us. some people have to deal with creeps in real life and online. I just deleted my snapchat and took off my dms to the amount of creeps. and it sucks because I like dressing up I like being a girly girl. it's how I cope with depression. another thing is when I walk guys will purposely honk their horns or drive by me slowly.

like how do I deal with this, how do I avoid people doing this. it makes me want to avoid public even more. but I don't want to obtain agoraphobia, because even when I think no one cares this still happens to me. the spotlight effect is partially true yes, most normal people don't care but this sucks :(",1763562132.0,socialanxiety
1p18eph,I backed out of security training last minute and I feel terrible,"I went to an enrolment session today for the SIA SWAP training thinking this would be a good opportunity to get back into public work. I haven’t worked in public areas for a very long time. I’ve been working from home part-time with minimal to no interaction and it’s been taking a toll on my anxiety.

I’m fed up of not being able to interact with people as much as I want to and I feel stuck being home but at the same time my body won’t allow me to be around people as it messes with my speech so badly.

I made my way there, saw the people enrolling with me, and immediately started feeling shelled up. Our assessor even told us to really think about whether we wanted to commit and said we were free to back out if not ready.

The course lasts a full month with very strict rules and no skips allowed (My work coach also warned me about that personally) and that would already be a big commitment from the jump. It took a lot of courage for me to even speak out to say that I wasn’t able to commit. Two other people backed out as well.

I got back home and immediately started second guessing my decision. Part of me feels guilty, like maybe I should’ve pushed through and enrolled anyway. And the other part knows it would’ve probably been too much and made my social anxiety worse.

I’m having this feeling of deep guilt and frustration but I’m also trying to be honest about what I can handle right now and it’s honestly eating me up a bit. I just needed to rant here.

I try to speak coming out fo my boundary. Not too much but still I put effort to talk. But I don't know what cues I give anyone to make things awkward with anyone.

This is not with one person but with everyone I meet. Is this because I talk freely in the beginning. But I don't know how to continue that sometime but still I try. But it end up awkward.

1p13w40,Feeling left out in a discord group I'm close to because they love voice calls and I don't,"I don't know if this is a vent or question, I suppose the former. Ever since I was a kid I've had big issues with feeling left out- with friends, family, coworkers, whatever. It has always hurt *so* much and makes me a little irrationally angry, if I'm being really honest. I've tried finding meaningful ways to get over this, but it still happens to me as an adult.

I enjoy this group a lot (and it's a server I made myself for a fandom we're all in). There's about 6-8 of us but besides me and one other guy, they LOVE doing group calls. I truly don't understand the appeal; they're not usually even playing games together, which is what I thought the purpose of those voice channels was; they're just joking and talking. I would rather die, honestly lol. Texting is wonderful because there's no pressure to reply right away, you can edit anything embarrassing you say, you can confront conflict without as much of the awkwardness as you can when you speak, etc. So almost every day during the night when we used to always chat and joke around, they all vanish into the voice channel, leaving me to either wait for someone to come back to talk or leave discord when I was hoping we could all hang out there.

I realize they're not trying to leave me out. One who I'm closest to once made the others wait to see if I would join. Another said it was fun and asked if I'd like to come. they're all really nice, truly. I just wish they'd stop with the calls and go back to instant messaging, which is kind of the whole reason I made this server. **But** I also realize obviously it's unfair to expect them to quit their fun just so I can talk to people in the regular channels. (In the sub we all met on, it's gotten considerably smaller in recent months so inviting more people I'm comfortable with will be very difficult.)

I'm sorry if this sounds like a childish problem. It's just bothering me a lot. I've been a little isolated since I moved to another country, haven't seen my family in 2 years, and while my husband is my best friend in the world and we spend a lot of quality time together, as a very shy introvert the internet has always felt like a world where I can finally open up without as much of my social anxiety hindering me. So this world gets even smaller for me.",1763547434.0,socialanxiety
1p13w07,I finally went to therapy and I don't know how to feel,"Going to therapy when you have SA is extremely difficult. My worst fear is talking to strangers and figures of authority and therapy is basically that. The entire session felt like ""exposure"" therapy tbh. I was so nervous that I couldn't even answer the questions with full honesty. I felt like my brain was just coming up with random answers to get through the interrogation as soon as possible. I felt extremely bad for not being able to be myself. I couldn't really open up (and didn't even want to).
During the entire session I felt like i shouldn't have come and that I should have solved my problems on my own instead of turning them into something to go to therapy for. I don't even know what to expect. I can't even believe in a ""cure"".
And It felt so bad being vulnerable to a stranger...

Anyway, I also suspect that I have bpd but I can't open up about it for the life of me. I feel extremely embarrassed about that one. I don't even know how to bring it up because of how complicated it has become.. 
I kinda regret doing therapy. SA is a problem but at the end of the day I don't really want to become ""social"", I'm an introvert and even if my anxiety went away, I wouldn't want to socialise that much..
And the main problem I have with therapy is that I am supposed to talk and talking for me in social settings is a nightmare. So how am I hoping to benefit from therapy? I practically forget what I want to say when I'm nervous. My voice starts shaking and I lose track of my chain of thoughts and start talking gibberish.. It's really bad and deep down I know therapy is not gonna do it for me..

1p1176j,"As a teenager, socializing is my biggest fear.","I’m a junior in high school and I don’t really have many friends. I talk to people here and there but most times it’s cause I don’t want to ignore them as they speak to me. I’ve been ignored so many times whenever I try to bring up a point that I can’t bring myself to do it to someone else, it feels terrible.

Anyways, I have two friends I sit with during lunch and they’re the only people I can talk to even though it’s just awkward. Sometimes I’ll try and start a conversation and say “How’s your day” and they’ll say “it’s good, what about you” and I’ll respond and it’ll end. I mean, pure silence for an hour. I’m scared of speaking to people but this year I’ve gotten a little better cause phones were.

Sometimes people start conversations with me and ask me about things I don’t want to talk about like my grades. Sure, my grades are all A’s but usually people who ask me about my grades tend to have higher grades than me in AP courses (which I do not take) so for the most part it feels like I’m being judged. Sometimes I care so much that a comment made on something that it replays in my head the entire day, sometimes ever longer. 

And the worst part of it all: Speaking in front of people. I don’t know why but anytime my name is called to answer a question everything I know just disappears and I say the wrong answer then proceed to beat myself up over it, calling myself stupid. This is definitely overreaction cause nobody cares, I don’t really care that much but I don’t get it. Why is it that I still fear?

I have no romantic relationships whatsoever and in one of my classes it’s all I hear about. I keep getting asked about how it’s going with that one girl that they (one of my classmates) happened to see me sitting with, but she’s a friend with some common interests and I don’t talk to her much. I just don’t like it when people turn their whole life into their relationship and make it so that everyone knows how it’s going. It’s probably just a me thing.

This year has been way better than it was Sophomore year. I had no friends at all, and I’d go home without uttering a single sound. This year is kind of different but I can’t help but just feel frightened when I have to start a conversation with someone that I don’t know.

1p113ge,Fear of rejection,"My whole life I’ve wanted to be part of something, to be accepted, to be wanted, to be someone… 

yet I am a coward.

always been. 

  
It was the first day of sixth grade. I had just moved to a new neighborhood and on top of that I was starting middle school in an unfamiliar place where I didn’t know anyone. I was also feeling this peculiar new emotion of intense self-consciousness that paralyzed me in fear and kept my lips shut tight, preventing me from making any new friends. I had always been a shy kid who took time to warm up to people, but this was a new level of social aversion perhaps brought about by my entry into preteenagehood. I minded my business all day not saying a word to anyone, and at last I found myself sitting alone on the bus ride home looking out the window with a forlorn expression on my face. 

“Hi sweetie, are you sad?” An eighth grade girl had taken pity on me and was attempting to cheer me up. I said nothing. “I know I look scary, I promise I won’t bite. I’m not scary right?” She looked toward her friend for support. I continued to give her nothing until she eventually shrugged her shoulders and went back to her seat.



This is a pattern that would continue for the rest of my life. I desperately wish to be accepted, to have friends, to be seen. I spend every waking moment agonizing in pain that this is not the reality. Yet, every chance I get, every opportunity that is presented to me– to be seen, to make a friend, to be part of the group– I reject it. I reject it; ignoring everyone around me and actively holding myself down, denying any and all attempts from other persons to get to know me. I squirm in place, head down, waiting for their attention to fall off me. All the while, I’m dying inside, I’m screaming at myself not to do this again– my thoughts are racing with the persistent idea that everyone hates me, everyone is disgusted by me, why am I like this? 



I reject people before they can reject me. I deny myself the opportunity before I can make a fool of myself. Before I can say something stupid. Before they have the chance to see me for the loser I really am. So, I reject them first. I don’t let them in. I’d rather wallow in my self pity than take the risk of rendering myself vulnerable to their rejection.

1p106d7,Should I work towards popularity or being okay not being popular?,"My social anxiety occurs more than what I think is healthy and I (17F) believe it comes from my insecurities I've grown over the years being that having no best friend, no huge group of friends, I only go out with my family, and then appearance-focused ones later on. What's worse is that I find--few but more than I'd think--people in my position and they just wouldn't care as much as I would. They can still have good, real interactions with people and don't feel embarrassed to reveal things like they're not doing anything for their birthday. I just envy that, to speak my mind and not miss so many opportunities to make connections.

Though I tell myself I don't REALLY care about stuff like birthday parties and best friends, that I want it because today's society, social media, or whatever, I get so sad at the thought of my older sister with her many best friends that she goes out with often, my younger sister who's evolving from negative loner to also being busy and hanging with her group of friends. I don't think it's just society, I feel like my life would genuinely be more fulfilled with more people around me who really KNEW me and appreciated me.

My concerns would be satisfied if I just became more social and popular, but I would also become confident fully content if I learn to be okay being alone and go through the day having good and fun, small interactions. But surely that's more difficult to do especially with all the people I'm surrounded with being so loved. Which one should I be working towards? Any advice for either of the two options?

TL;DR: There are people who are more lonely and still content which I wish to be. But it mentally destroys me when I compare myself and realize I don't have a bunch of people who know me or appreciate me because I'm so inauthentic around everyone.

1p0yve4,Dissociating when talking to people?,"I think I’m dissociating sometimes when I’m talking to people and I wondered if others here experience this too.

I think it’s mostly happening when I’m in a situation where I’m sharing my thoughts about something and feel vulnerable, or if I’m talking to someone that I really want to like me and I’m afraid of messing things up somehow.

The best way I can think to describe it is it’s like I’m talking but I’m kind of on autopilot, like there are words coming out of my mouth but I feel like I lose the ability to really think things through, like words are coming out relatively unfiltered, I feel kind of numb, and it’s like I’m speaking and experiencing the conversation from somewhere recessed toward the back of my body. I feel like that probably sounds really weird but I’m hoping that will somewhat make sense and someone can relate.

Again just wondered if that’s something others experience sometimes in social situations. And if you have any advice I’d gladly take that too. I’m aware of grounding techniques and those have worked well for me for flashbacks but so far I have not had enough awareness in the moment to realize I’m dissociating in order to use a grounding technique, if that makes sense.

1p0s4ux,I am so lost,"To tell you the truth, I feel really embarrassed to write on here about myself and I dont even know what to write I just need to release. My social anxiety has held me back from situations as long as I can remember, im a 16 year old boy and find it extremely difficult to hold a conversation let alone start one. I feel restrained from certain situations and it is so frustrating that I know what im doing wrong 😅 . Additionally, im very insecure about myself especially being a late bloomer, constantly worried what others say about my appearance- leading me to avoid being seen infront of some people at school. 

I have a few friends but none are true friendships to me, i dont know i just feel like i cant connect with anyone and im afraid of what people think of me all the time. Im constantly stressed, looking if others are staring at me for doing something wrong. But the thing is, I know the world doesnt revolve around me it is just really difficult for me to help myself. Ive searched up countless questions in order to help me improve as a person but i just cant, i cant, its been like this for years. I want to change. 

I cant even bring myself to buy stuff at shops with or without people. I just fear i will do something wrong but i need to escape the barrier i put on myself. Also, when im with my parents I dont know what it is but i just cant talk to other people like a normal 16 year old. Honestly, my mind is jumbled right now I dont know what to do. Im also feeling pressured to get a job but I cant bring myself to face the challenges, I cant bear to think of the wretched thought of interacting with people for many hours a day. But I want to prove to people that I am normal and arent inferior. Im also quite skinny and underweight, dont have a hairstyle, dont have a fashion sense, dont have a sheer purpose, dont know what i want to do when im 18+, i find myself overthinking every single thing of my damn life even now im questioning why im even writing all of this. On the occasion im doing something well i will always think negatively even though i know i shouldnt, which leads me to not doing it well as a result whatever i do. 

To many this many seem like an overreaction and to be honest it may be. Im just sick and tired being afraid to make that move in situations. I play some sports (cricket especially) and more times than i can remember i dont take the risky play or put myself out there in any sport. Its like im in the backseat of my own self, knowing what to do but cant control it know matter how hard i try to break that barrier. Furthermore, I lack SO MUCH common sense it is unreal, I am even afraid to refill my water bottle!?! I know, it is ridiculous as i dont know what to do. My attention span is deep fried and i cant focus on anything, i barely find anything enjoyable, when i watch a show or play a game the fun is ruined by me thinking “this isnt real whats the point of it” which to be fair i never used to think. Recently, my mental health has gotten far worse and i dont know if it is hormonal problems but it seems to me it is larger than that. Honestly the amount of thoughts flooding my brain is mindblowing right now i could write tons more but i dont want to yap on too much even though i have for ages. Anyway to conclude, I hope whoever reads this can help me in my situation and could possibly relate to me. It would really help me to try and improve myself in life and I hope whoever reads this is also doing well currently, but thank you for reading this!",1763509991.0,socialanxiety
1p0s4nd,I always have a poker face- should I start smiling at girls that build eye contact?,"I am a fairly attractive guy. Not extremely, but attractive enough for girls to build eye contact with me in public. Sadly i have always had social anxiety. Luckily it got better so I can hold eye contact with strangers now... However I have a poker face. I always had this, I genuinely lack of expression i don't know why. So if a girl builds eye contact eg. in public transport than I look back at her but without showing any expression. Should I start smiling when a girl builds eye contact?

1p0rxw8,I don’t find enjoyment in talking to new people,"I don’t find enjoyment in talking to new people now. I like watching people talk and joke around as if they’re characters in a show that I’m watching but I don’t like participating. I never know what to say and I usually end up feeling like I said the wrong thing and that I’ll end up cringing at what I say and do.

People are also judgmental. Naturally. All reactions are a form of judgment, just processing another person’s actions requires judging them. 

I don’t like being around people either. It feels so suffocating and I can’t think clearly either. The only time I feel free is when I’m alone by myself.  ",1763509487.0,socialanxiety
1p0qcje,Its not just the social anxiety. It is also the side effects of stress that make life difficult.,"Hey guys, just wanted to share my thoughts. I feel like because social anxiety Sets us into a constant Spiral of stress and worry, for me especially at school. Afterwards, overthinking and being insecure about what you've said Sets in. And all this creates constant stress...


And for me, this stress makes me tired. I can only Hardly concentrate. Mood swings, irritability, and occasionally depressive moods ruin the days, all because the constant stress tires the system.
And it makes you more stressed over time.


Yeah just wanted to ask, am i the only one? :)

1p0p41n,Why can’t I mix with other people as well as they can with each other?,"I’m 16 and for my whole life, I have never really fit in. I was never, and still am not, anybody’s first choice. I know this probably sounds narcissistic but I am never chosen over anyone ever. I have had friend groups but I always had to force myself into conversations and had to awkwardly listen as they talked about their parties I wasn’t invited to. Now a lot of this happens when I was younger but I notice it happens a lot now as well. For example, everyone in my friend group knows each other well and are always talking about each other, but know body talks about me. I never come up in conversation unless did something really memorable or did something wrong. Why am I never talked about. Also, in my football team, I am always left by myself in warm ups and stuff because everyone else always talks to each other, but nobody talks to me. I always have to force myself into conversations and then I look awkward and pushy. I have done this a lot over my life and I hate it. Why can’t I be talked to. Why does nobody care about me. What am I doing wrong. 

I really hate myself, my self esteem is so fucking low. At football practice, I literally don’t bother going into space sometimes because I know I’m not good enough to do anything or I know I’m probably not going to get passed to. My coaches get annoyed and pull me aside when I do that but in my eyes it’s fine. Everyone would be fine without me. Which brings me on to my next point. Everyone would be fine without me. Nothing would change. Genuinely, I contribute nothing in my friend group, at football practice, when means my friends go out. I feel like such a side character. I feel like I’m always pushed to the edge ( at times I have literally noticed that it’s happened, it happens a lot). What am I doing so wrong that I can’t mix without other people well. Why am I never talk to. Why do i feel so invisible. 

This was mainly a rant, but I would really appreciate any advice or uplifting words or why this happens or why I feel this way, but I don’t think it’s going to help to be honest.

But that's not the problem, the problem is that they never include me in stuff, never thought of asking to hang out, never asked me if i want to play with them, they didnt even tell me about their social accounts (their all friends in social media) and it makes me feel like im not even a friend to them, their also my only friends, not to mention the extreme social anxiety i have. I have tried to talk to my therapist, but she says to stop being friends with them.

1p0jtkr,Ughhhh you guys I can’t do this anymore !!!,"I can’t do this guys, I am just so so done and fed up with being constantly socially anxious. This has got to be one of the worst forms of anxiety to deal with, if not one of the worst mental illnesses to deal with in general. I used to have so much more hope and motivation to expose myself to the world and try to get over this, but that motivation is gone and I don’t think I can get it back. I had a really horrible experience with an old roommate of mine, someone who is literally just a demon in human form and is quite possibly one of the most despicable and hateful people on the entire planet. This girl really destroyed any hope I had to go out and make friends and try to function normally with extroverts in society, she made my life miserable on purpose because she accused me of doing stuff that I would never do (like eating her food despite the fact that we had THREE other roommates, yet she never blamed them). She called campus police on me one time because I took a shower at 2am like GIRL I COULD NOT SLEEP AND I WANTED TO SHOWER, LEAVE ME ALONE!! I eventually thank god was able to find another room, and when I moved out she kept giving me the most disgusting smug and arrogant looks. I was so nervous because of her when moving out that I ended up dropping and breaking a bunch of really valuable and cherished coffee cups that my mom gave me when I first went to college, and she literally just laughed OUT LOUD in my face. Anyway, eventually I moved out and I’ve been living with other roommates who are actually fairly chill for the most part, but because of this awful experience, I can’t even interact with them because I’m so scared and I even get nervous when they see me, I literally plan out my day around what time they’re gonna be home, if they’re in the living room, etc. It’s an awful awful way to live and I am so done with it.

1p0fo16,"Social anxiety, hyper sexuality and womens","

Hi, I'm dealing with a really troubling problem.
I'm 20 years old, haven't really been in a relationship yet, and haven't made love.

My romantic situation has been: from first grade onwards, having one crush per year until sophomore year of high school.
Romantic failures, meaning heartbreak, rejection (from women too), harassment (from women too).

No stable family model, which led to me being very uncomfortable showing what I feel.
From the beginning it was complicated and I had a very strange way of saying I love you (I would kick my crush in the butt and run away - I never dared tell her I loved her, actually it was a classmate who told on me).

Then I developed social anxiety during my adolescence.

When I was in sophomore year, I smoked a big joint with my best friend and I felt like I was having feelings for him.
It broke me at the time, I almost became schizophrenic and had suicidal thoughts afterwards.

After that, suddenly women seemed very attractive to me.
Whereas before I only had one crush per year.
So I started being very receptive to female beauty.
And it became even more exacerbated since I took ayahuasca (a powerful psychedelic medicine), changa (same), and ashwagandha (sold as an adaptogen, it's a psychotropic that increases sexual attraction for me).

The more time passes, the more powerful this attraction becomes - just seeing a woman, talking to a woman triggers a chemical cocktail that makes me high.

The problem I have is social anxiety.
It's complicated with people in general, with women I'm attracted to it's mission impossible.
I don't know how create intimate connections anymore. 
I tremble, I paralyze, I freeze, I fall apart.
Impossible to have a rational thought with all this stress, yet I meditate a lot, but despite that this tendency is stronger than me.

And it's also very painful, this strong desire to create emotional and sexual connections and the gap with the fact that I feel unable to do it  because I'm completely parasitized by my mental health issues, and approaching a woman is the door to reopening my wounds and feeling even worse afterwards because it's the repetition of a situation that's experienced as a personal failure.

I also have a lot of intrusive thoughts that are gradually losing their hold on me little by little thanks to the things I do to feel better.
But if I were in a relationship situation for example, with the fear of losing my partner or experiencing rejection, I think I would be dragged into a whirlwind of intrusive thoughts.

Does anyone here share my situation?
How can I get out of this, without using psychotropics in my case because that's impossible for me now?
I could ask how to cure social anxiety with anybody then, but girls are most disabling as you see. 


I've already put things in place that already help realise that it's not me the problem but my conditions. 
Inner child therapy
Metta meditation
Intensive meditation
Intention meditation
Study of Buddhism 
Breathwork
No fap 
Addressing physical health issues (to remove pain from the situation and consider psychotropic therapy)
I'm trying therapies little by little 
Tai chi, qi Cong who knows if this can help 

I thought also about playing theater but I don't feel ready right now. 
It seems a good cure for shyness but first I would like to feel more secure and quiet.

1p0deqq,Can’t walk outside without anxiety,"I would say, I have pretty bad social anxiety it stems from traumas such as bullying and abuse. I remember being an outgoing kid when I was younger, but then I got bullied and abused which caused me to develop social anxiety. I’ve been this way since the eighth grade. I think overtime though it’s gotten worse as I don’t talk to as many people or go outside as much as I did when I was younger. I only go outside when needed such as for work or school. My job has little to no socialization as we work by ourselves, and at college I don’t talk to anyone and just attend class and go home. My social skills have kind of faded away as time has gone on due to this. 

They’ve gotten so bad though it’s to a point where even saying hi or hello to someone gives me anxiety. I can’t even walk outside without me thinking people are going to make fun of me. It feels so awkward walking when there’s people driving by in their cars it feels like their eyes are on me and judging. I know logically people driving by in their cars do not care about me enough to stare at me for more than five seconds, but I always get this feeling in the back of my head. It’s honestly one of pure fear. I think people are judging me and making fun of the way that I walk the way, the that I look. Maybe they’re making assumptions about me or they’re annoyed that I’m on the road because I’m slowing the traffic down by crossing the street.

It’s really gotten in my way of being able to go outside. I don’t have a car yet, so I tend to order things online even though I live right next to a shopping center. I hardly ever go to stores or social events. I feel so anxious all the time over things so small I wish I was normal. ",1763476216.0,socialanxiety

1p070gc,Social anxiety and being unlikable.,"Im in my early 20’s. I already have bad social anxiety, but recently I’ve realized that I’m an extremely unlikable person. 

I don’t think this realization is a warped perception of myself due to the anxiety. 

Literally every person I’ve ever befriended has ended up eventually avoiding me, ignoring me or completely ghosting me. Never with an explanation.

I never understood why, I’ve always tried my best to be open minded, kind, show interest in them, and in general treat them the way I would want to be treated. I force myself out of my comfort zone, and try my best to suppress my anxiety to be more extroverted and appealing. 

No matter how much I try to change no one ever wants to be my friend for long. Some people don’t even like me right off the bat, and they make it very obvious. 

I feel sad. Stupid and pathetic. I’m embarrassed of who I am. I was born to be alone forever. 

I can’t even make friends online. Whenever I try to make a friend online I’m always the one who ends up trying to keep the convo alive. The other person eventually ends up taking days to reply or ghosting me. I don’t spam or try to be annoying, I always try to keep the same energy they give.  

I try my best to put myself out there and expose myself to situations but rejection after rejection makes it more difficult to beat social anxiety. 

It also breaks my heart because I put so much love and energy into these friendships and no one ever gives the energy back.

I give up. ",1763455989.0,socialanxiety
