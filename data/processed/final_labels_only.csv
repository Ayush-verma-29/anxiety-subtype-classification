1poydsr,looking for someone who has been through something similar grief panic stress hi everyone i am hoping to hear some opinions on whether people think i had a panic attack or not i know that no one here is a doctor so i guess i just want to tell my story and see if this is has happened to anyone else i guess i should start with saying i have really good years versus really bad years so i have never been officially medicated for anxiety because i somehow always snap myself out of it i had a really bad bout with some panic back in 2018 because i had hashimoto s disease and did not know it once that got figured out things normalized though i carried some medical ptsd around from bad doctors and experiences just trying to get that diagnosed and medication dosage correct i have had a therapist since that time in september 2024 my mother died after a three year fight with a horrible cancer somehow i held it in the road because i m the only daughter and the show would not go on without me after making sure my family still acted as normal as possible i had a bad case of health anxiety in january 2025 i got everything looked at and was normal again by march in may my dad started calling me complaining of something growing on his face i m four hours from him i pushed him to doctors from afar and they all thought it was a tooth problem turns out it was also cancer he had a major removal surgery in july 2024 and then radiated his follow up scan is tomorrow the thought of this cancer not be gone and losing my remaining parent is killing me on top of that my husband started traveling for work much more leaving me alone a lot more this past year for some reason i am scared to be alone i ve expressed this to him and while he does the have the option of not traveling on every trip he does so anyway because i think the rest of his team are incapable of making presentations this is actually true because i ve heard the phone calls read his work emails and texts it s not a lie to get away from me lol in october my boss basically decided that he was going to beef with the longest tenured employee at our office over some mistakes she had made and something else really petty it was a long drawn out show that ended up with her being let go on the day she was let go it was my birthday and i was in florida it made me incredibly anxious because she and i were friends and confidants in the work place i worried she would retaliate and reveal some not so nice things i ve said about working there my boss also called me all day that day to rehash her conversation with her i m sort of like second or third in command there also i am in charge of celebrating everyone s birthday in the office and everyone forgot mine after florida i had a two week sinus infection all of this pretty much places us at thanksgiving where i cook for my whole family decorate my parents home i still call it that even though my mom is gone for christmas and place flowers on her grave it consumes the whole four days i have off and then my husband and i have to make the four hour drive back on the following day i return to work and admittedly i m a little tense because i worried the laid off coworker would show on her last day and my husband was leaving on the next day for a work trip after lunch out of nowhere i had some palpitations and got really scared i thought i was going to die in the office i called for 9 1 1 and an ambulance came and of course i was tachy with a high bp when they came we went to the er trop levels good ekg good ecgs good thyroid number was almost 12 they really didn t say much of anything to me and just told me to follow up with my endo and pcp since then i ve had more pvcs and such a hard time coping thinking i have a heart condition or something i wore a monitor last week and am waiting on the results if you ve made it this far thank you so much i just want to know if you think my life is overly stressful and could cause this hiccup or if you ve experienced something similar also i don t want to give away too many details on what i do for a living on here but just now that i had to get a professional degree for three years work in an office and i may have to wear a suit pretty frequently to argue about money,panic_disorder
1poy2jl,muscle fatigue and low energy somewhere around mid high school i started noticing that my arms and legs would get sore and tired very quickly this happened while biking and exercising and i was constantly exhausted often falling asleep during classes despite trying to stay awake nowadays it affects everyday life walking up stairs or working with my arms above shoulder height makes my muscles feel like they have no energy forcing me to rest even at work this physically holds me back after screwing above my head i often need to lower my arms for a few seconds before i can continue when i wake up my back and chest feel quickly fatigued and sore often with a mild feeling of breath hunger or oxygen shortage i also have frequent muscle twitches people notice that i sigh sometimes and think i m irritated but i feel like i m just trying to get enough air i struggle heavily with concentration at work to the point where colleagues notice it coffee helps somewhat i fall asleep suddenly during meetings lessons or while using public transport even in noisy environments it comes on abruptly i ve also had derealisation since primary school at some point i became afraid i had a muscle or neuromuscular disease after seeing many doctors i was referred to the hospital emgs of my limbs respiratory tests and extensive blood work all came back normal recently i was tested for chronic hyperventilation and scored 100 on all parts my carbon dioxide levels were clearly too low this surprised me as i never noticed myself hyperventilating i ve always known i have social anxiety sometimes severe but i never expected it to impact my physical health this much i m still unsure whether all of this can be explained by chronic hyperventilation at the same time i m at least somewhat relieved and even a bit glad that there is finally something that has been diagnosed hearing from others with similar experiences would really help,social_anxiety

1powv3p,does this happen to anyone else i have noticed that when i have days off i have a lot of anxiety during the first few days it s only the first few days and then i am back to normal i tried to pin point why i am sad and anxious and the only things i am able to think of is i miss some of my coworkers or maybe the change of routine i do have the same anxiety the first few days when back to work i have come to dread taking days off because i know i will have anxiety during and after the days off i feel like i am ungrateful because i don t enjoy my days off to the fullest and i start to feel guilty i want to know how to deal with it it is normal to feel this way,generalized_anxiety
1powrb1,anxiety was the smoke not the fire i want to share my story as far as professionals are concerned i have a general anxiety disorder diagnosed at 33 nothing before that one period of stress when i was 18 but that s only because i wanted some time off work i could never put into words what i was feeling from that very first whoosh at 33 which then caused panic like someone took my breath away and tilted everything 90 degrees for a split second and i disassociated those first 3 days i was a mess crying on the phone to my doctor about what this was was i dying full impending doom then years of being told its anxiety i guess it was but the anxiety wasn t the start of the river the anxiety was further downstream something was causing this fluctuation causing me to be wired 24 7 and i tried everything i studied my degree in psychology i had to reaffirm my identity i wanted to understand myself so i delved into my past my traumas my mistakes if this was anxiety then there was a cause if i knew the cause then there was a solution i wrote and i wrote and i wrote i jumped feet first into key life changing moments in my life finding out i was a donor baby losing my mum my marriage breaking down some childhood trauma events i tried every herbal remedy going i read books on vitamin d being the cause calcium magnesium water intake needing to be more a whole book on bloody water electrolytes books on b12 b6 k2 potassium salt sunlight morning sun evening sun circadian rhythm sleep cycles lunar cycles i got into breathing exercises pranayama nadi shodhana self talking self soothing self parenting birdsong sounds of the forest the sound of my own voice reassuring me tre trauma releasing excercising patting prodding yoga high intense training mammalian dive reflex cold face packs breathing breathwork facial muscle changes in humans from processed soft foods cognitive behaviour therapy talking therapy touch therapy hypnosis it became a perpential cycle it became an obsession a health anxiety in its own right the search for the cause became the cause itself it was a minefield just when i thought i d mastered it 2 days later i was back on my ass all of these things worked a little but only if i balanced all these things absolutely perfectly i could have a good day but there was too many variables and i d never have two good days in a row maybe they worked because i wanted them to work maybe they were placebo i became an expert in talking about identity i was adamant it was linked to that with going through my own identity crisis a few years earlier i talked about identity like i had it all figured out i didn t and still don t diazepam was lovely but i ve seen what a benzo addiction looks like and i don t want that i was allowed 28 per year generally it was the only relief i got having to balance 28 blocks of 4 hour relief 112 hours per year of relief i had the stigma of having anxiety the looks you get the comments of being weak the huffs from people when you decline to do something the empathy sometimes but also the disappointment in their eyes all the time i was going through this i held down a job i climbed my career although i m known for being firey i m a good dad and believe in being a morally good person i started a successful relationships but no one every described me as patient it took everything i had to not sit in the corner and rock exhausting is an understatement the more i masked the more it took out of me the worse i was the next day it began to shape me i was no longer care free i was no longer the funny guy people knew me as i was becoming bitter and defensive the fear of it caused fear itself the anxiety became about the anxiety it was getting worse i had a full on panic attack trying to go into a theatre with my daughter the shame i felt as a grown man that i couldn t emotionally get through the door because i was crying and my 10 year old daughter saw that she didn t know that i d had whooshs all day and was already suffering even with diazepam i found myself not wanting to go anywhere where i was trapped either physically like a plane or socially at a theatre 7 years of being told i had anxiety you ve got anxiety some people just get it a few times i doubted myself there was a period where i just accepted that i did have it but it always sat at the back of my mind this is an imbalance of something you ve just got to find out what it is i started to rename it i didn t have anxiety i had an imbalance to my nervous system my nervous system was firing constantly when no danger was present it wasn t me that was broken it was my nervous system most of this was internal i struggled internally a lot and wouldn t tell anyone because to say it out loud would it give it a voice i felt like absolute shit and i didn t know why i would catatrophise on my own health i would seem really impatient from an outside point of view and i would overthink things they didn t know that by the time we started talking at 10am i d already done a whole day of fighting and flighting christmas was always a difficult time for me and when i consumed most of my diazepam the deadlines the gifts the parties the foods the alcohol the responsibilities of being a parent and is it enough alcohol was a gamble sometimes it provided relief sometimes it took a worst turn when i was already drunk the hangxiety was terrible i was due a minor operation and in my pre op i had my blood pressure taken but this time they took it seriously and kept me for an hour to see if it would go down it didn t my highest on that day was 190 125 i asked the consultant if this would explain anxiety and he answered in a way that made me feel like i m an idiot for never even considering it not once did i ever suspect high blood pressure was the cause i m a healthcare professional and its constantly documented that hypertension is a silent killer no symptoms no clues well it wasn t so silent with me every time i had my blood pressure taken they marked it as white coat hypertension they said things like oh that s high but you are nervous and you have just walked in here i never made the link because there is so little evidence out there that i ve seen i m 4 weeks into a new blood pressure tablet and i haven t felt like this in 7 years to the point where i ve even tried to internalise to see if the anxiety is in there and it isn t i ve gone out to dinner a party a work meeting with 40 people in one room with the exit on the other side an elevator and all at my worst time of the year nothing not a quiver is there no negative thoughts about being trapped no dizziness no surreal moments no dissociation i actually felt nerves the other day like real nerves butterflies in the stomach real nerves for a real situation i haven t felt that in years whenever i should have felt that my body just dumped a shit tonne of adrenaline into my blood stream and then i d crash a few hours after being an impatient dickhead i also felt thirst another thing i haven t felt in years unless it was extreme my body didn t have time for these little introspective clues it s been fighting since 2018 i feel like i have my life back and i m incredibly proud of myself for living those 7 years on full flight or fight and still managing to hold a life together although i am cold now 7 years of constantly being too hot and adrenalated and now i m out the other side it s bloody freezing and i don t have the wardrobe for it anymore in hindsight yes i do have anxiety but only when my blood pressure is reading an average of 180 120 on the bright side at least i know how i act under enormous pressure incoherant rushing everything at 90mph dizzy and detached with the occasional crying episode but i never ran or quit and i soooo wanted to i m sharing this because i know how important it is to read success stories and to feel seen to know there is a light at the end of the tunnel and for some maybe vit d is the reason maybe tre will be the key to your trauma healing if i hadn t had a proactive doctor then i would have been on this path for years without finding the answer i think our own anxiety is worth exploring some times it is a physical reason other times we are our own worst enemy and the cause is our own internal thought pattern and coping mechanisms its about balance trying something new but not obsessing over it this is not an argument against anxiety i lived it for 7 years and i felt it every god damn day constant impending doom and my soul is tired but hopefully that door has closed now and i can continue to be an advocate for understanding it this is an argument for curiosity when it starts late and feels physical this might not be the end of it i may be back in 3 months debating whether it s better to breath out for 4 seconds or 6 but it feels different this time and it s been miles longer than any previous attempt keep going there s always a light,panic_disorder
1pow5lo,my brief guide to temporary long term alleviation of physical symptoms i ve been dealing with anxiety for most of my conscious life and for a long time i didn t realise it was anxiety i m sure a lot of people can relate to that what has remained is my physical reaction following or preceding bouts of anxiety perhaps the most disconcerting aspect of anxiety for me at least as i ve built up techniques and such over the years i figured i d share them i really hope that this post can give at least one person some relief if not provide a post for people to discuss their own techniques : 1 vapour rub peppermint oil or peppermint smelling things like toothpaste lavender rubbing alcohol good for: stomach throat and chest symptoms what a life saver as someone who has a very intense sense of smell i find smells that are either positively nostalgic like vapour rub and the memories of taking a sick day off of school and watching youtube while it rains outside or just calming for my body like peppermint or lavender to be helpful in grounding intense smells such as the eucalyptus methanol of vapour rub or peppermint can actually help you feel the sensation of air hitting the back of your throat this can be very assuring if you suffer from throat tightness globes sensations or feelings of discomfort when breathing this for me at least can have a run off affect for my chest tightness and help alleviate that rubbing alcohol and peppermint have also helped with nausea this is very old knowledge that was used by many generations of people don t knock it till you try it 2 ginger tea lollies pickle raw good for: stomach symptoms classic any form of ginger has been known to calm the stomach especially as you feel an acidic bubbling typically relief is within 5 10 mins but this can vary my preferred forms are: ginger tea around 2x2inch piece of peeled ginger root with a squeeze of lime juice a piece of lime and honey as desired ginger lollies gin gins are amazing and come in many different strengths the extra strong is my fav pickled ginger yes the type you often get with sushi or even raw small small amounts to start this is a desperate measure 3 breathe in and then breathe some more good for: throat and chest symptoms massive credit to whoever posted this on reddit some years ago it s a technique i can t live without when my respiratory symptoms play up here s what you do: breathe in through the nose all the way until your chest feels like it s filled with air then take one more big sniff then breathe out through the mouth i often feel instant relief but rinse and repeat as needed 4 heat packs hot showers good for: stomach throat and chest symptoms heat on areas that feel tense or cramping can often provide near immediate relief this can also feel like a grounding sensation which is particularly good when paired with breathing techniques 5 legs up ladies good for: head symptoms so one night i went to a concert i decided that eating beforehand wasn t in my best interests and well i collapsed towards the end thankfully i fainted surrounded by a group of nurses if there s any chance you are seeing this i m still grateful and i really hope i don t ruin your night : so what did they do they placed my calves onto their legs and let the blood flow return and i awakened this is now a trick i do when i feel dizzy or uncomfortable in my head so all you do is: lay down flat next to an elevated surface couch is usually easiest if not a few stacked pillows and place your legs onto that surface making sure your hips are still on the ground imagine the letter z but if that middle line was straight stay there for a few minutes and let your body do its thing 6 got any games on your phone good for: general anxiety symptoms unfortunately i was lucky enough to be stuck in an elevator once what got me through candy crush sometimes the brain just needs an immediate distraction and it might not always work but it could also help big up the youtube playables they re quick simple fast and vary in demand for concentration thought this can often have a run off affect to your physical symptoms aiding as a distraction until the feeling has passed 7 the magic pack good for: all i really suggest that if you like these techniques or if you have some of your own always take an anxiety pack with you it s always a good feeling to have something you can rely on so even if it s just one item i really suggest having something with you to be your lifeline in the unlikely event of sudden anxiety i hope you found something interesting or even something genuinely helpful there are so many other techniques i really suggest commenting to help share the community spirit and bring hope anxiety can be debilitating but even if for a brief moment there could be a way for you to have some relief and i hope i ve helped in that journey 3,panic_disorder

1povnyn,0 5mg lorazepam prescribed as od prn by my psychiatrist 5 weeks ago i know od prn means once daily as needed but if i feel it is needed every day due to acute anxiety misery on morning awakening can it be taken once every day answers coming up on goooogle an ai to this question are confusing me and are often contradictory and the emphasis placed on all the possible problems caused by taking it dose every day are terrifying me i know many people take much larger doses than 0 5mg and for months even years despite medical guidelines including uk nhs that lorazepam should only be taken for 2 4 weeks it s been prescribed to me while venlafaxine is taking its time kicking in hopefully to full efficacy for me but that can take a few weeks or more longer i ve taken it for 5 weeks now but at a low dose of 75mg per day along with 15mg mirtazapine i would appreciate replies from fellow group members about this thank you ps: i m age 66 female and healthy as far as i know in every way except depression anxiety which have been plaguing me for 15 months since my husband died :,generalized_anxiety

1pouosy,living with undiagnosed chronic anxiety feels like a never ending panic tw: existential questions hi i won t disclose my name but im a 16 year old african girl who is dealing with undiagnosed chronic anxiety and frequent panic attacks the reason i mentioned that im african is cuz no one takes your anxiety seriously in here psychological care therapy is almost impossible to find that s why i say undiagnosed instead of diagnosed so that u understand my situation better i don t even know where to start every morning i wake up hoping i won t feel panicky like i m bracing myself for my own brain it s exhausting some days my thoughts spiral so fast that i feel like i m losing control and even small things can trigger a wave of panic i get these overwhelming what if loops about life and existence and sometimes i can t stop questioning everything like why i exist where do we come from or what s the point of it all it s not that i want to give up or anything it s just tiring i feel trapped inside my own head constantly fighting my body and brain just to feel normal for a few minutes even when i know it s anxiety and not reality it doesn t stop the fear or the racing thoughts i just wish my brain would let me rest and i want cry so bad right now because i see my peers living normally while i struggle with this anxiety and panic attacks i had my last panic attack last month and this year i had a total of 5 6 panic attacks it genuinely hurts to live like this im not going to lie sometimes i wish i was dealing with other mental illnesses other than chronic anxiety i feel misunderstood as well because of the thoughts that cause me to have anxiety and panic attacks very few people struggle the same way i do and it makes me feel way worse and lonely and i feel like my thoughts are very convincing and i m discovering some truth no one knows,panic_disorder
1pou7qq,please help what s happening to me is this ocd am i going crazy i m desperate and i don t understand okay so i ve been struggling a lot for like 4 months now and it s not like it came out of nowhere but nothing like this has ever happened to me before so i m very confused when i started uni i struggled with health anxiety and panic attacks then agoraphobia but all that went away after a while now i m struggling again but completely differently i d like to preface this story by saying that i never struggled with intrusive thoughts or anything like that when i was younger the first time something like that even occured to me was when there was that tripophobia thing circling the internet where i thought how peculiar it was that something that didn t make me uncomfortable before now made me uncomfortable because someone told me it should then a thought crossed my mind that if it can happen with this it can happen with other things but not much changed then years later i was learning about ocd for a class in uni and i got so scared of the thought that it could be possible to implant anything you want into your mind and that s where all hell began for me i d have a random thought and be like oh no what if this sticks now i d also like to add that i ve suffered with some tics here and there and what rly scared me was implementing ticks so i would get rly scared and then start doing the tick because i can t get it out of my head and so i d prove my own theory that i can implement anything into my own head just like that i implemented into my own mind that i won t be able to sleep because a friend told me that she keeps waking up early unable to fall back asleep and since then i have had fear of sleeping on and off and even issues with failling asleep but not because i m not tired but because i kept jolting awake in fear another thing i ve also had big freakouts in the past about random stuff i implemented inside my mind one time i made myself feel like i can t speak and i would legit struggle to start speaking but i could still forget about it if i plays a game or something but that went away too so basically i ve had anxious freakouts and hyperfocus on things for a while it s like i always needed something to be anxious about that said none of that existed before that big revelation that you can implement anything in my last year of uni but sadly things got really bad for me this summer in mid august i started having stomach pains after prolonged stress in life and at work i had countless labs and after a few weeks i was diagnosed with ibs which got me extremely scared since i googled and learned it was incurable i got very anxious lost my appetite and got hyperfixated on fixing the issue after a while it was all that i could think about i was so scared and frustrated that i couldn t get it out of my head that it quickly turned into a fear of not being able to get it out of my head and relax which is so stupid i know it got so bad that i was prescribed prazepam which i took for like 2 months i want to add that even at my worst in the past when i got prescribed benzos i didn t really take them and only took a little when i couldn t sleep before an exam or so prazepam helped a bit but i was still scared hyperfocused on my stomach crying several times a day and became disinterested in anything else i got off it because you re only supposed to take it for 2 months a few days before i stopped taking it i experienced a worsening with my stomach so i started extreme dieting again and slowly started tapering off the drug days later i completely lost my appetite then i got scared what might happen if i now thought about appetite loss every time i ate and got anxiety because of it so my appetite would never return and it would be the same as sleep this spiraled very quickly this part happened at the very end of october and since then i ve been very anxious with almost no ability to disconnect from my thoughts about all this and it s not always active thoughts i can watch a show for example but i m unable to just watch it and forget about all this there s still this feeling in the back of my mind that s creating a knot in my stomach like i get a second of peace and it s back to this terrible feeling and me trying to relax and not notice it so far i ve tried to block it ignore it rise above it everything but now i m so poorly that i can barely eat i start randomly gagging for like 10 times in a row keep jolting awake at night with this terrible pit in my stomach i can t focus on anything else and i m especially unable to relax like when i go to sit and watch tv or play a game my mind goes okay here it comes now relax and the feeling kicks in again i also feel traumatised by all this so even thinking about a previous day makes it feel like i m reliving a traumatising event i m completely unable to function or do anything my stomach is still so bad i tried so many different doctors meds and supplements but it s not even about the stomach anymore i d also like to say that i had some pockets of days where i had some appetite or a few good hours or so sometimes the thoughts or the feeling will be there still but i d feel better especially on a short trip to switzerland this month there i even slept most night for 8 9h with some sleep meds however ever since i came back a week ago it s been hell i ve spiraled so much right now my days are hell and my nights even worse even with the meds i keep jolting awake nauseous and then i keep trying to calm myself down by thinking about something else which i m unable to do most of the time but the frustration just grows and i keep feeling worse and worse and my brain just keeps adding new things to be anxious about what if this what if that and then it really starts feeling whatever it imagines right now i m in bed just googling unwilling to start my day please help me it feels like my life is over i m so scared that i

1potybz,how i finally quit vaping and kept my anxiety under control just wanted to share something that s helped me in case it helps someone else i ve struggled with anxiety for a long time and vaping became this constant crutch i began not really enjoying the vape so i wanted to quit but my anxiety just wouldn t let me every time i tried to stop suddenly my anxiety spiked and it felt like too much so i d end up going back to it what finally worked for me was taking the pressure off completely instead of quitting i just delayed my first vape of the day no rules no punishment no forcing it even pushing it back 10 minutes each day felt manageable and weirdly that alone reduced my anxiety because i wasn t fighting myself all day over time the urges softened and the panic around needing it faded it took me about 50 days by slowly pushing my first vape of the day later and later it eventually blended into my bedtime and one day i realised i d gone the whole day without vaping this approach felt way kinder on my nervous system than cold turkey ever did no gum no replacements no white knuckling honestly the feeling is like no other finally beating a habit i d struggled with for years it felt like a little win in a world that can be pretty harsh not saying it s for everyone just sharing in case anyone else feels like quitting makes their anxiety spiral sometimes easing off instead of ripping the band aid can make a big difference i ve put all the steps and tips into a small guide if you want it send me a message and i ll happily share sorry if this post is against the rules genuinely just want to just help people,social_anxiety

1poqwkk,waking up with anxiety attacks and diarrhea light trigger warning for mention of abuse once hi i don t know if this is the right sub for this but i could really use some help i 23f have had severe gad general anxiety disorder since i was a teenager along with severe depression resulting from it but also from intense studies and childhood abuse i d also like to mention that i have a huge phobia of diarrhea after repeated illnesses i had when i was little or so i guess but this phobia has been there since i was a child and i can t remember when it even started not the most glamourous phobia to have and i always hate to mention it but i managed to control it and even overcome a bit of it since then and of course i deal with ibs d a great combo but just so you know that when i get diarrhea it actively triggers my anxiety which triggers more my bowel etc a never ending cycle usually when i suddenly get an anxiety attack i m able to go through it without much consequences and carry on with my day this is thanks to my antidepressants efexor also known as venlafaxine i ve been taking for five years now now i ve tried with my psychiatrist several antidepressants for my severe depression even accidentally exceeding the normal dose in blood without even noticing it for a few years and none worked but venlafaxine actually helped with my bowel movements by slowing it down considerably it felt like heaven because i was able to function again without that angry bowel of mine and my anxiety was more manageable i still had my gad and some attacks but without much consequences which is why i continued taking them with the approval of my psychiatrist of course living a normal professional school life again improved my depression so it was a win win when it comes to anxiolytics however and just like antidepressants for my depression none worked so far my psychiatrist thus suggested i had treatment resistant depression anxiety which means my brain just doesn t respond to these meds so therapy is my only and last hope and i ve been under therapy for a decade now starting before the meds so therapy is my only and last hope and i ve been in therapy for a decade now having started before medication it s been a bit helpful but nothing grand unfortunately now why i m making this post finally i mentioned i ve been able to manage my ibs and diarrhea episodes thanks to my antidepressants for five years now even when under severe anxiety but since september i ve had a new form of anxiety attack when i wake up triggering my bowel like never before and of course my phobia which worsens even more my anxiety etc i let you guess what happens next it usually stop after i go to the bathroom though it leaves me weak for a few days it happens very randomly and i can have nothing for weeks all i know is that it only happens in the morning just after waking up but it has been triggering my phobia again and it feels like everything i ve worked on mostly for these past 5 years whether for my anxiety or my phobia has just blown up i don t even know where it comes from no medication can help with that as you ve just read and i don t know what to do i m at a loss i m already underweight so losing more weight could be serious my psychiatrist isn t available before february it impacts my job and my uni studies and leaves my ashamed to call in sick because of that sometimes i still go because i have to but i can t work for the first few hours because i m stuck in the toilets i m so afraid i have to quit my job i ve worked so hard on getting because of that stupid disorder have you guys experienced the same thing where suddenly in your life your anxiety flares up again like never before if yes what was your solution if you found one my situation is a tricky one and i wish medication could work on me i could really use a hug rn thank you for reading and i m sorry if my english is a bit funny it s not my mother tongue tldr anxiety isn t new for me and medication doesn t work because treatment resistant i could manage these past few years because an antidepressant stopped most of my bowel movements and thus reduced my anxiety however since september i experience new anxiety attacks that give me severe diarrhea even with my medications i don t know how to handle that and it feels like everything i ve worked on for years just fell apart,generalized_anxiety

1poqhv6,evolution and anxiety just joined so forgive me if you ve heard it before i learned that anxiety was integral in the evolution of our species a bunch of cave men go out hunting and come to a fork in the path they take the right side and a saber tooth tiger jumps out and kills one the rest run back to the cave they still need food so they go out again the next day and come to the fork they remember what happened yesterday and can imagine a future scenario where the same thing will happen if they go right they go left unfortunately technology has advanced so much and there are fewer real threats out there but our brains haven t had enough time to catch up and that survival mechanism is still on high alert on the bright side we might not even be here if our species did not have this double edged sword i ve had it all of my life and absolutely hate it besides meds and alcohol only helping other people and seeing my nieces and nephews seems to take it away temporarily i seriously considered getting a lobotomy to get rid of that part of my brain if that s even possible we re all in this together better days ahead,panic_disorder
1popppx,ongoing physical symptoms anxiety spiral struggling to feel normal again hi everyone i m posting here because i ve been having a really hard time and i don t know how to break out of this cycle about 7 weeks ago i started feeling unwell at first i thought it was just the flu but it never really stopped i felt constantly tired and off without being able to clearly explain what was wrong because of this i ended up doing a lot of tests: multiple blood tests x rays an ultrasound and even going to the er everything came back completely normal except for ferritin which was elevated around 370 with the upper limit being 250 i ve spoken with two doctors and both told me that there s nothing to do right now and that all the tests look fine overall physically things have started to improve a bit but this long period of feeling unwell really triggered my anxiety everyone just say that i m recovery from a virus or something similar and it might take a lot of months now i m stuck in a constant loop of checking my body for symptoms and thinking that something terrible is wrong or that i m about to die even though the doctors say i m okay some days i feel bad physically other days it feels like the anxiety itself is what s making me feel bad and most days it s probably both either way i don t feel like i can have a normal day anymore i had been doing much better with anxiety before all of this and it s really discouraging to feel like i m back at the beginning again i guess i m just looking to hear from anyone who s been through something similar especially health anxiety after a long unexplained physical issue and how you managed to cope or slowly feel normal again,generalized_anxiety

1pop1qu,check your weight okay so it probably should ve been obvious but if u have a history of elevated blood pressure even at a healthy weight u probably shouldn t go overboard with how much u are eating so what happened is that after a month or two of a dirty bulk and sedentary lifestyle i woke up with my legs feeling restless and relentless anxiety then for a year or two i had crippling anxiety and panic attacks and a general feeling of being off been to the er twice and general check up once done the ekg multiple times because of suspected heart problem they would always start with the blood pressure finger monitor and then they would escalate to the ekg i ve been through it at least 3 times anyways after trying to narrow down the million possible things that could be causing the crippling anxiety i ve found that slimming down greatly alleviated it at my peak weight i was still at a healthy bmi but i had always been skinny so i guess my body wasn t used to the bulk i dropped down a significant bit and must have crossed some threshold where my body is able to comfortably sustain my blood pressure,panic_disorder

1pomt60,sleep anxiety: does anyone else find bedtime stories weirdly helpful for sleep anxiety my sleep anxiety has been absolutely spiraling lately it s that awful feeling where the second the lights go out my chest gets tight and my brain decides to replay every awkward conversation i ve had since 2012 it s exhausting and makes me dread going to bed i realized recently that the only thing that actually calms me down is basically being treated like a toddler i felt silly asking but i eventually got my boyfriend to tell me a bedtime story about my teddy bear just to get my brain to focus on his voice instead of my thoughts it worked surprisingly well it just made me feel safe i guess kind of like how my parents used to read to me when i was little the only problem is i feel incredibly guilty asking him to do this every single night he s tired too and half the time he falls asleep before i do i tried listening to podcasts but they were too engaging and silence just let the anxiety back in i went looking for something to fill that gap and stumbled on a platform called lullaby it s been a decent substitute for when my boyfriend is too tired or asleep you can basically set it up to tell stories in a specific voice which helps mimic that being read to feeling without the guilt of keeping someone else awake it s not exactly the same as a real person obviously but if you re single or your partner is a heavy sleeper it might be worth a shot hope this helps someone get some rest tonight,social_anxiety

1poiuyh,feel like i ruined my life : hi i m 27 and dealing with intense anxiety right now i went through a really severe depressive episode in october and november it was the kind where getting out of bed felt impossible i was crying constantly and my thoughts were really scary i m only just starting to feel a little better during that time i made a financial mistake i forgot to make a payment after switching phones and disabling autopay earlier and i didn t realize until it was too late as a result i ended up with a 30 day late payment on my credit report objectively i know this happens to people but emotionally it completely sent me into a spiral ever since my anxiety has been overwhelming i can t stop replaying it in my head or thinking about what it might mean for my future i feel ashamed scared and like i ve undone all the progress i was starting to make with my mental health i ve been crying constantly and having trouble eating working or focusing on anything else i was raised with a lot of fear around making mistakes especially financial ones and this has triggered a really deep sense of panic and hopelessness it feels like my brain is stuck in a loop and i can t calm myself down i m not really looking for advice or fixes i mostly just need reassurance from people who understand anxiety or to hear from anyone who s gone through something similar and eventually felt okay again i doubt i can get it removed so i have to focus on coping thank you for reading i really appreciate any kind words,panic_disorder

1pogzsh,anxiety about night sweats i ve had health anxiety for as long as i can remember and have had times where it s been super rough as well as times where it s been pretty manageable however i was doing so well with managing it for a pretty long time actually i d say maybe for about a year but recently l relapsed and began having severe health anxiety again due to me having night sweats seemingly out of no where in which has been going on for a few months now i m aware that night sweats can mean something medically serious which is why i m spiraling basically my night sweats began in september and have been on going since they re not drenching i just wake up pretty sweaty in certain areas a couple nights mornings a week when they first started in september i was only experiencing them in between my breasts i m female just to clarify and on my chest about 2 weeks ago tho i began also having them in between my legs on the back of my legs on my lower back top half of my butt and in the groin area where my inner thighs meet with my groin in addition to also still having them in the chest area again it s not bad enough to drench my bedsheets but it does leave my pjs slightly damp in the area where i ve been sweating i have a physical on friday so i will bring this up with my doctor and i am planning on getting blood work done too but i fr cannot stop spiraling over this just last night i woke up with sweat on my forehead which is what has really caused me to spiral since now my forehead is getting sweaty i sleep on my side for anyone wondering now i would like to mention that i do have issues with restrictive eating habits in which i ve dealt with restrictive eating habits since around the time spring of 2024 as that s when i had developed an ed so i m not sure if that could be a potential cause of my night sweats but regardless my health anxiety likes to go straight to the worst case scenario and tell me it s not another thing to mention i have one of those foam mattress toppers put on top of my mattress in which i had put on there sometime in late august before the night sweats started however i don t sleep directly on top of the foam mattress topper as i have a thin sheet and then a comforter put over top of it and then the comforter is what i sleep on but again idk if the foam mattress topper could have something to do with the night sweats i m only 21 years old but even tho i m relatively young i m still worried sick that i may have cancer or something i do take birth control and anti depressants at night i d say a few hours before bed which both can cause night sweats but i ve taken them for years and they ve never caused night sweats prior to this so i don t think it s them causing it lastly i do have a tendency to eat carb related stuff like cereal a few hours before bed in which when i eat this type of stuff at night it always makes me feel jittery but i feel like if that was the cause of my night sweats i wouldn t be waking up in the morning sweaty too sometimes considering that by that point it s been a whole 12 hours later since i had last eaten and no longer feel jittery from the sugary carbs i ate the night before,panic_disorder

1poe2mr,period anxiety i just need to get it out of my head for a little my anxiety is actually at an okay level but now i got my period and the pain triggers anxiety it s probably the hormones but it s the actual pain that makes me actively feel the anxiety i want to read before bed but i m uncomfortable about putting my phone down i need the distraction does anyone else experience anxiety worse when you have your period people talk about how you ll be more susceptible to anxiety during different parts of the cycle but not during the actual thing,generalized_anxiety
1pod6la,anxiety about leaving the house i don t have full blown anxiety attacks or panic attacks on a regular basis but i m generally a very tense and anxious person i constantly worry about various things in the future and ways things might go wrong so i m typically on edge as a baseline one thing that gets me particularly nervous is leaving my house to do errands work is monotonous enough that it doesn t typically make me anxious to go there and when i m going to spend time with friends i also don t really get anxious however whenever i have to go to the bank pick up meds get gas or get on the highway for any reason my anxiety levels shoot up and i feel terrified and end up procrastinating and wanting it to be over sometimes this even means i can t enjoy my ice skating lessons as i have to drive on the highway to get there so i often feel anxious the whole time i m at my lesson is there any way to help calm this and maybe an explanation as well i do all of these things regularly and though they re not everyday occurrences i do one of these things at least once a week i m sick of feeling nauseous and scared every time i need to just fill up my gas tank i genuinely can t imagine how it feels to do mundane errands without feeling anxious,panic_disorder

1poc8sz,constant anxiety for week straight so i ve been dealing withy anxiety for 3 or 4 years now it all started because i gotta cotton mouth from eating a edible for the first time and i couldn t stop thinking about it till one day i start getting physical symptoms of anxiety so i was stuck in constant fear i had a panic attack week 1 constantly cried because i couldn t deal with it anymore until about a month when i finally managed to keep it under control and live normally until i started getting certain fears like looking into the sky or going out at night causing me to feel light the same feeling i get from my fear of heights but other than that i was fine at home 2 years ago the anxiety started scaring me again so i got blood work done and saw i was fine so i went back to feeling normal cut to a month ago i was eating food and drinking a coke i rarely drink soda and after an hour i started having bad stomach and chest pain turns out i started getting acid reflux symptoms after all that a week after i got a panic attack again for the first time in 2 years then the next week again now 6 days ago i had one of the worst panic attacks that made my left arm feel weak and scared me so much i couldn t speak when i was finally able to i called 911 because it literally felt like i was going to have a stroke or heart attack the paramedics came and saw nothing wrong with me and said it was just my anxiety next d ay i was fine till my left arm started getting the tingling sensation again and felt weak again it wasnt as bad and i was able to get it back down till my mom wanted me to go with her to a restaurant with my cousin i was enjoying the food but i started getting brain fog something that happens with me a lot when i m not in my safe space so my anxiety started again so i had to go inside the car by myself so i could catch my breath and calm down it took crying to get rid of it next day i was fine after talking to my mom about it till the middle of the day when my arms both suddenly felt intense pins and needles like as if both arms weren t getting blood flow just typing it here is giving a bit of worry again i got it to a manageable state and went into my living room to watch something while i let the anxiety pass i got up to adjust the couch and i guess i lost my footing because i had to catch my self when going back down on the couch and when i did i felt a wave of a fuzzy feeling move through the left side of my body which scared me so much my heart beat sped up a lot to the 110 s so i called my mom wanting to go to the emergency room out of fear and even called my friend because i wanted to have the people i trust the most with me i was in the car feeling like i was going to die the whole time while my mom was panicking to find a spot that took my insurance and the only spots available were hours away so i told her to just take me to the emergency room which she did and my mom and my friend when we got there asked if this was really what i wanted and that it could take hours to be checked out and they talked me into finally calming down and slowing my heart rate which was near 130 at that time i felt normal for the rest of the night yesterday i wanted my friend to hang out with me and during it i got the brain fog feeling again which also gave the pins and needles in my left arm and leg again it finally went away around 5 during the day and the rest of the day was normal now today 3 hours after waking up the fuzzy feeling in my left hand returned i tried exercising again and it didn t go away i called the 988 number just to talk to someone since no one else is available it helped when talking but the feeling just won t go away my left foot constantly feels as if something is moving underneath it and my left hand constantly has this fuzzy feeling which is really noticeable when i rub it against something and let go it has a lingering fuzzy feeling i genuinely don t know what to do because the things i used to distract my mind before aren t working anymore these sensations keep making me think something wrong is happening when i know this all started because of that panic attack that made my arm feel weak i keep telling myself i m fine and i m okay but my body just fights back i don t want to go back on medication either i tried weed the other day and it did make me feel relaxed but i don t want to rely on it and get addicted to it i ve even tried doing exercises every morning and walking more but the feelings persist and it just makes me want to lay down and cry i haven t even eaten yet because i don t want to move from where i am i don t know what to do update: arm feeling turned into a restless feeling and because i was talking to myself about how i always get light headed when looking up outside the lightheaded feeling won t go away another update: tried gaming after a week to help calm down and it worked for 30 minutes before that pins and needles feeling started showing up in both hands i got off the game a while ago and now i have the lingering fuzzy feeling plus the pins and needles,panic_disorder

1pob0da,i feel like i am constantly being watched judged and am unable to perform even the most basic private actions without paralyzing fear i am writing this because i am struggling immensely with what i believe has escalated far beyond normal anxiety i feel like my life is constantly under surveillance even when i am alone in my own home my anxiety makes it impossible for me to perform basic private acts of life without intense fear and hyper vigilance i experience a complete loss of privacy i cannot masturbate in the bathroom or in my locked room because my mother is highly invasive even though she only walked in on me once the anticipation that she will catch me is debilitating furthermore i face public paralysis: i cannot look at my phone in public because i constantly imagine people staring judging or laughing at me the very act of visualizing their eyes on me while i use my device is unbearable in social interactions i cannot make eye contact with people especially service attendants i struggle to hold my head up or speak without stuttering when talking to them because i am simultaneously focused on avoiding their gaze and panicking about my performance this feeling extends to my own home as a constant surveillance i am consumed by the feeling that someone is observing me constantly i cannot use my computer if the door is open nor can i open a bottle of medication or do the slightest act without the overwhelming preoccupation that i am being watched the core fear translates into daily chronic worry about being caught or judged for anything i do no matter how insignificant i live in fear of being caught even when smoking a cigarette on my own balcony i have the overwhelming sensation that i am sitting weird or that my hair doesn t look right i feel the need to constantly anticipate someone opening the door so i can hide or put out my cigarette and i worry intensely that someone will hear the music i m listening to and judge my taste this constant anxiety has severely compromised my quality of life autonomy and freedom the fear of external judgment has taken away my ability to simply exist in peace i am looking for advice or shared experiences from others who have struggled with this level of crippling social anxiety and hyper vigilance,social_anxiety

1po5ofj,gut anxiety feedback loop hi everyone i feel as though this might be a long rant but i m so done right now and was wondering if anyone else had experienced anything like this to try to start at the beginning around i started to be under some pretty intense stress in january this year though the actual implications and breakdown of all this didn t really make itself clear to me until april may april may june july were all an intense period of anxiety and panic attacks for me i couldn t go to classes without having to stop walking on the way there to catch my breath etc the anxiety and panic was debilitating and all encompassing and i genuinely thought i was dying but at the same time i was functioning and going to my classes and seminars doing my work and trying to push through it all i don t think i truly realised how trapped in a panic anxiety spiral i was at the same time as all these things started to feel off with my gut i thought it was just that i wasn t eating well so i tried to eat my fibre and veg etc but if anything that just made things worse but again i ignored and pushed through because i had no idea what else to do tbh i refused to think deeply about these things i was worried something was seriously wrong with me but i couldn t and refused to face it i thought if i got to the summer everything would just get better then it got to summer and i still had these horrible gut issues where sorry its tmi the consistency of my stool was all over the place i ended up going on holiday with some friends and it felt like torture trying to keep up with other people when my body felt like it wasn t functioning right i was eating whatever and i felt so bloated and god damn awful the entire time and it was so so hot which i don t do well with at all i ended up making excuses to not go on 2 trips to the beach because the idea of being so far from where we were staying and a toilet was scary to me but once i was home things only escalated every time i left the house it was all i could think about my gut issues also became worse because i would now get these seemingly out of nowhere incredibly painful like i m about to pass out or throw up chills sweating etc lower left abdominal cramping where my body would feel the need to expel everything in it again tmi sorry these episodes were happening once or twice a week and seemingly only getting more intense i was supposed to go to germany this summer i couldn t bring myself to do it i went on the train to stay at my sisters and i felt so ill the entire time it was like my intestines and stomach were on fire again still eating everything i felt so seriously unwell and any journey out of the house it was all i could think about even when i was home it was all i thought about a constant loop i am still stuck in eventually i started to cut out foods basically all food i went to the doctors to whom i don t think i described my experiences well enough who took my blood and a stool sample and then told me nothing was wrong and it was probably ibs i ve also gone to the doctors for my anxiety done online courses and cbt been prescribed anti depressants which i haven t taken yet because i m scared on what effect they ll have on my body and gut they said it could be celiac but that as i haven t been eating gluten they can t tell since then i ve basically been on my own this was in september i became so miserable but had to start thinking of how i was going to move back to uni and function i identified a handful of safe foods i could eat and stuck only to them i went back to uni i have amazing friends who have been very supportive and kind but i still am missing out on so much i have been gradually trying to expand what i eat but its still only around 10 15 things that i stick to and due to in person lectures and meetings i m in my third year i have just been wanting to be stable the good news is that since keeping my diet like this i haven t had any painful episodes though some weird stool consistency but even writing that its been 2 5 months without an episode feels like tempting fate like im cursing myself same with leaving my room house it s the constant what ifs i ve missed out on my friends on being around them ive stopped socialising as much i only leave my room when i need to because otherwise being outside stresses me out so so much and all i can think of is what ifs this is my issue now i want to eat more foods and expand but it scares me so so much i m back home for a month for christmas and my family doesn t know anything about any of my struggles we aren t close and don t really share this kind of information i feel so limited i m just so terrified of everything and the fact that i still have no idea what is wrong or what caused any of this is scary is it ibs is it an intolerance is the way i m thinking about this arfid ocd anxiety anyone s experiences or thoughts would be so greatly appreciated i just feel really alone,panic_disorder

1pnwq9p,high anxiety and heart rate help sorry for bad english beforehand hello everyone it s been a while since i posted on this sub for reference i m 20m and i ve been dealing with anxiety for a good 3 years my main issue with anxiety has been my high heart rate usually in the 100 110s 120s at college or when i m working so for the past few months i ve been doing the most to change my life i dropped 37 40 pounds i m 216 5 6 quit smoking quit drinking just ocasionally like once a month i drink quit doing substances and started doing more exercise and trying to be better to myself all of these things definetly have helped me live a better life in the long run but as of pretty recently i ve been feeling so horrible to the point i wonder if i m going to suddenly die since 3 months ago i ve been fasting by fasting i mean i don t really eat during the day or sometimes i don t eat at all or i eat something that s ridiculously low calorie for a meal an apple and a yogurt and i think my body has been feeling the toll of not eating because my body feels like it s shaking and i feel really faint sometimes i seriously don t know what to do my pulse could be 100 or 110 when trying to do anything standing up or when i work and it can jump to 120 130 when walking and it makes me feel terribly anxious that s why i haven t been able to continue exercising because my pulse goes to that heart rate and i get so nervous i start having a panic attack also all of this anxiety has been triggering the worse stomach pains and movement where i feel like i m going to fart at all times of the day my stomach moves around so much that i don t even take a shit normally i m always suffering indigestion the only thing that calms my mind is that when i m lying down on my bed completely relaxed and doing breathing exercises before bed my pulse is around 70 85 so i guess i m not that unhealthy i d love to get some help :,panic_disorder
1pnwnbn,insomnia with health anxiety so i ve been a regular on this subreddit for the past week basically starting abt a week ago i started having major panic attacks with heart palpitations restlessness chest pain tightness tingling etc pretty much lasting 24 7 until a few days ago my heart calmed down ive had multiple ecgs since and even a chest x ray with normal results but im still not satisfied because i haven t done all the tests still haven t gotten a holter monitor or echocardiogram its hard to trust that doctors are taking me seriously if they know i have anxiety thus im always conscious of my heartbeat and can always feel it in my chest even if im just lying there i was prescribed 1 mg xanax and 0 1 mg clonidine on top of what i was already prescribed 37 5 mg effexor and 20 mg buspar 3x daily but im honestly scared to take my new meds because im terrified they will cause my heart to stop i have a resting hr of around 55 and to me this is scary ive started to isolate my family with how strongly convicted i am that i have health issues should i just go and get the tests or accept this uncertainty i ve seen so many posts videos online of people with heart abnormalities misdiagnosed with mere anxiety and it terrifies me i feel like im stuck in an endless loop of fear and paranoia the only reason im not in the hospital right now is because i don t want to make my family mad at me but i dont want to sleep either out of fear my heart will just give out on me especially combined with the meds im taking right now im up watching family guy in line to text with a crisis counselor just trying to make the night go by faster until i continue my php program tomorrow i just keep checking my pulse i got out of inpatient a week ago but with this new fear im starting to think i should just go back it literally feels like my life is a horror movie im constantly aware of omens and impending doom death and fighting to avoid it i ve tried the deep breathing ive tried trying to accept it what do i do i m exhausted and extremely frightened anyone who has experienced this what has helped you doctors advice also greatly appreciated,panic_disorder
1pnwn0l,my advice on where to start with a baseline i think its important that everyone with anxiety cuts out common causes for a time to get a general baseline before trying other things so these are the changes id suggest to make for one month to get a baseline: 1 no caffeine of any kind some people are extremely sensitive or it can be a multiplier for anxiety you can go one month without it to be sure 2 no alcohol its proven to directly contribute to anxiety 3 no weed for the same reasons as alcohol 4 30 min of nature a day light walking its a human and needed thing for me 4 no artificial sweets if you need sugar have sugar in moderation anecdotally it can affect gut biome which can exacerbate anxiety this one is a bit more out there but worth trying 5 sleep hygiene dark room no phone and book if you cant sleep yet same wakeup and sleep every day including weekends important note: you might still have anxiety at the end of one month but starting with cutting out common causes can give a baseline to work off of you can rule out these things as a cause if im wrong and if your anxiety is much lessened you can then start to figure out which of these was a cause,generalized_anxiety

1pnw140,does loud music help anyone i have always loved music i have had periods of anxiety in my life and occasionally had bouts of depression recently i have been suffering a lot with anxiety not panic attacks but general feelings of unease due to a sudden end to a relationship that i really thought was going well plus we had redundancies at work which made me worry i m also divorced but still living with the ex and kids until she is ready to sell i m financially responsible for the mortgage bills etc that s our financial agreement until we sell the recent sudden end of this relationship seemed to cause a ripple effect that pulled away my guard rail and sparked this period of anxiety worrying about my future will i end up alone is this it all that kind of stuff this last weekend i visited a friend in another city and we went out to this club the music system was really good and although i was a bit anxious about going out when i got into the club it was a really nice happy crowd and the music was just incredible my anxiety all but disappeared and i just danced and danced i found that the loud music vibrating through me calmed me and just carried me with it i loved the feeling of just being inside the music it made me feel safe and happy my friend told me that she could see i was in my happy place there she said you just looked relieved it seems counterintuitive when you couple loud places with anxiety but i was wondering if anyone else here feels this same kind of thing with music,social_anxiety
1pnw0q5,combining a benzo and an anti depressant in addition to general anxiety disorder i also have bipolar taking a benzo alone for anxiety is okay but can leave me feeling unmotivated and somewhat depressed on the other hand taking an anti depressant by itself can swing me to a hypo manic episode it seems by combining a benzo with its depressive effects with an anti depressant that will lift me up both combined together is great with mood stabilization and in particular both together are potent for anxiety without destabilizing my mood does anyone else here combine a benzo and an anti depressant to double down on anxiety without too much affect on overall mood,panic_disorder

1pnukn6,sleepless nights caused by false vacuum decay theory i recently went down a rabbit hole on human consciousness and just how conscious works and ever since then i have been experiencing anxiety attacks and sleepless nights once or twice every couple of weeks i have become horrified by the idea of losing my conscious experience and never experiencing anything every again what s been on my mind lately is a theory i remember hearing about a while ago called false vacuum decay the theory is that randomly at any point in the universe a bubble could form and expand outwards at the speed of light inside the bubble all of physics essentially becomes rewritten and there s literally no way to predict if a bubble is coming our way now what scares me about this is that we have no idea if there is a bubble near and if one does arrive then we don t just die we get erased instantly there is no pain there is no suffering there s no nothing and honestly i feel like just having the constant stream of experience suddenly stop rather than slowly fade away in front of my eyes is much more terrifying i ve done some research on the topic and learned that the chances of a bubble forming are so astronomically small that we may as well just consider it zero the chances of one forming are something around 1 in 10 100 which i can clearly see and acknowledge is unfathomably small despite this my brain is not satisfied with any number greater than zero i know that i m way more likely to die from lightning or a car crash or from literally anything else but i feel like literally everything else is somewhat within my control i can kinda control whether i get into a car crash or not i can kinda control if i get struck by lightning but i can t control whether a bubble of vacuum decay is about to arrive at earth in a few seconds has anybody ever dealt with this kind of anxiety before or does anybody know how to cope with this it s gotten bad lately and i m looking into therapy because of it i m even thinking that i might want to try getting prescribed xanax or something like that because these attacks last for a long time are extremely distressing and don t really seem like they have a good way of being handled as opposed to ptsd depression etc,panic_disorder

1pnptbm,16m with anxiety hello i m a teenager in high school and i have anxiety and i think i have add but i don t want to sound pick me and say i have a plethora of other neurological disorders i first started seeing severe symptoms when i was somewhere between 8 or 9 years old or from what i can remember at least i m not sure entirely how anxiety happens but i think it had something to do with my dad and his anger issues in my early childhood that left a really big impression i remember more negatives than positives i always got terrified when anyone has something negative to say about me or if they re mad at me i typically overthink almost everything i do and profusely apologize for even the smallest mistakes this led to some people including my s o not valuing my apologies as much as i d hope for them to which really upsets me i ve always wondered if medication was the right path for me to take once my parents experienced my first anxiety attack which resulted in my screaming and needing to be restrained by my father they took me to therapy i didn t say a word to my therapist not that i resented her in any way i just couldn t bring myself to open up to a stranger i ve tried many ways of overcoming my anxiety but it seems to fluctuate and has even been getting worse over the years to the point where i m crying in my closet over trivial problems more on my s o she keeps trying to offer me advice but i feel helpless i try to explain to her what i feel when i m having an attack but i never seem to really get the point across my best explanation to her would probably be : imagine being forced to picture every possible outcome of every action you make filter out everything positive and you re left with the negative consequences now you have to live out every single scenario simultaneously while dealing with real life at the same time i don t know if this is accurate for any others in the subreddit but this is accurate to me i guess this is more a venting advice post if anything how do i manage my anxiety without shutting myself out from the rest of the world thanks for reading this this is the first time i ve publicly shared my experience with anxiety,social_anxiety
1pnpdux,doing too well to ask for help i don t even know how to explain this i ve had this feeling for a while for years maybe and i m in my early 20s so that s a bit weird i have a bachelor s degree in psychology and am finishing masters now i have a best friend a boyfriend i don t need to work to pay for college i have good grades i don t let myself fail at anything i m not social by any means but it feels like self sabotage because i can hold a conversation if i need to which leads to the reason of this post with all of this how am i ever supposed to get help i ve felt anxious my whole life and i can t remember the last time i was genuinely interested in a hobbie and didn t just quit i can t remember the last time i slept well for a full week i believe i often go through periods of depressive symptoms but it never continues or gets too serious the anxiety is always there though it s almost weird when i have one peaceful week but then it s back and it s worse i ve done worse i ve hurt myself much harder than i do now but also i hadn t done it in years and now i m doing it again and it feels weird the pain of it helps but it s weird why does it always feel like i m doing it on purpose even when i was 13 and parents or teachers asked me if i was okay i liked feeling like shit and hurting myself but secretly i cried myself to sleep every night trying to seem like a antisocial edgy teen i m well past that thank god but i can t stop that way of thinking i can t ask for help not even just for this for anything i hate feeling worthless what the fuck is wrong with me i don t feel anything as intense as anxiety and i know how diagnosis work i know how therapy works it feels like i d have to do it all myself anyway i told my family doctor i wasn t feeling super well and she said nothing stopped me from going through a psychotherapy process and it was like yes but her telling me that didnt make me go look for it i don t know why i expected something more impactful to feel something more is this normal for other people with mental issues i feel like no one ever talks about the self awareness of it how excruciating this is knowing every wrong ur doing and not being able to stop i know i need help i might get it one day but this will probably never stop since it s been my whole life am i not sick enough to just be helpless for anyone to want to help when is the ball going to drop,social_anxiety

1pno0m2,im scared of carrots basically for about 5 7 years ive been avoiding nearly most vegetables before that i was eating them normally amd liked them idk what the cause is but at some point if you tried to feed me carrots lettuce or most other vegetables i would refuse completely this still continues to this day but its concerning to me today after dinner i went to my bed i have a shared room with my sister she came later than me i saw her eating a raw carrot during dinner thats why iw anyed to leave asap when she got up she had already another carrot and she was eating it i asked her if she could not eat it but she refused which ig is reasonable for the whole time she was eating it i felt like i wanted to cry the sound of the crunch and that smell were litteraly killing me note tbh i dont think i have the sense of smell but i sometimes can feel smells that aint even there after she finished the carrot i couldnt help but feel as if the room was contaminated i now dont want to step near her side of the room and dont want to touch her bed every spot that is likely to be touched before she washed her hands is now also infected to me to exit the room i try opening it using the part of the handle which is often not touched or i think it is not i wiped the light switch for the bathroom 3 times with soap because its small and she definitely touched it idk how i feel about the floor i think it is dirty too yes to me all that the carrot may have touched is dirty am i goin insane the kitchen is always a war zone for me everytime i touch a counte the airfryer i wash my hands with soap if i open the fridge i open it from a spot where i never seen anyone open it from when i open a drawer or similar i touch the ends of the handles and ofc wash my hands straight after this happens to the most random things even some sauce bottles when i walk ont eh kitchen floor i try to barely make any steps and look at the floor all the time you could say just clean it then if ur scared of it but how can i clean something which other people think is just nothing litteraly i bet no one ever thought that vegetables leave dirt at first i used to think its about the texture of the food and i just didint like eating it but then i realised its obviously the look and the feel my 3 most hated things are carrots lettuce and broccoli while carrot and lettuce leave everything that touch them infected the broccoli is a litteral nightmare the green dots get everywhere and if i see any i want to throw up instantly because they can be anywhere even in my clothes already its litteraly impossible for me to live in this house without feeling like everything is contaminated because realistically who washes their hands everytime they touch a carrot this honestly feels like a joke of a post especially since i wrote so much and i could write even more but idk what that is and why im scared of them so much,social_anxiety

1pnm3b5,i feel like i never work enough is 50 60 hours a week sustainable or is this my anxiety talking i m 27 married and working full time in a lab role over the past few months i ve been working a lot of overtime initially it was occasional but it s slowly crept into being my norm i m hourly and we get paid double time so it helps a lot what started as 6:00am 3:30pm turned into 5:00am 3:30pm and now it s usually 5:00am 4:30pm i m consistently hitting 50 60 hours a week and mentally i feel like anything less than that isn t enough here s the issue: even when i do work those long hours i still feel behind and anxious if i ever leave early or have a slower day i immediately spiral and worry that overtime will dry up that i won t be making enough money and that i m failing as a provider i have some minor debt student loans starting soon and my wife and i want to buy a house and have kids in the next few years i feel like i have to grind at this age to be prepared but i m also realizing that my baseline for enough keeps moving upward and i don t know where it stops logically i know 40 hours is full time and 50 hours is already a lot emotionally it doesn t feel that way at all i ve also been diagnosed with anxiety ocd which probably isn t helping so i m looking for perspective from people who ve been there: is 50 hours a week actually a heavy workload long term how do you prepare financially for big life milestones without living in constant grind mode at what point does working hard turn into something unhealthy any advice or personal experiences would really help thanks,generalized_anxiety
1pnlx8s,i don t understand my diagnosis hey i am seeing a psychiatrist regularly and i am on medication for depression my main complaint she diagnosed me with gad and i came here because i m honestly confused is it possible to have anxiety and not feel anxious at all i don t think i constantly worry about things let alone multiple things and i don t think worry or anxiety stops me from living my life i don t have physical anxiety symptoms either i ve only gotten panic attacks as a result of bad reactions to medication and i don t get stuff like constantly being tense or feeling short of breath or like my heart is racing or anything of that sort i m just trying to understand what anxiety feels like and if maybe i might just be unaware of it or something like that i ve just always thought anxiety is one of those things i would notice having i guess so the diagnosis is really difficult for me to accept and i don t really relate to what i do know or have seen so far in trying to find information about it is it possible to have anxiety and be entirely unaware to have it without worrying about anything in the first place if so what are things you have tried to help you be able to better identify your anxiety,generalized_anxiety

1pndx6q,missing out on sleep due to anxiety this might be a little long but for context i ve always dealt with anxiety since i could remember i think my earliest memory of getting treatment i was about 5 years old and had just started school i m now 20 and still struggle with things but with multiple ups and downs i ve come across some great management skills and push through a whole lot more year by year there is just one thing i ve realised only recently that s really messing up my schedules and just day to day life my sleep i ve always had issues with sleeping such as insomnia but over the last few years i ve really developed some scarier thoughts during the night regarding my safety i am just so anxious that someone is watching my everyday routine from my back garden my bedroom faces the back or alternatively my house is going to get swarmed and broken into via the back any little noise and i m so hyper aware of everything some honourable things to mention: lived in this house my whole life parents house and only ever had one issue regarding my fears and they were quite minor some man was just going through cars and rubbish bins and another time police had used our side gate to catch someone jumping from fence to fence terrified of the police helicopters and they hover almost every night in my area and surrounding sometimes it s car chases i once asked back at school or apparently just overall surveillance it only makes my fears grow that someone is hiding in my area or more specifically my backyard while it was never confirmed an old neighbour that has since moved away claimed that there was a roof walker that would climb on everyone s roofs and get by from tree to tree she was a little odd but she was certain of it however our area has a lot of possums and the one time we were suspicious my dad went out and it was just a huge possum on our roof these feelings have only developed since i was around 16 or 17 so the last four or so years in this time i unfortunately went through a few traumatic assaults i am constantly hearing things foot steps rattling thuds breathing or anything that could raise my alarm bells i do live in a little bit of a dodgy area and home break ins have been a lot more frequent on the news lately the last thing to mention is that earlier on in the year i was left alone for the first time ever my whole family were out of state apart from my older sister who doesn t live with me anymore during one of these nights i fell asleep a lot earlier than usual maybe around 11pm i then woke up super super super distressed and anxious i was convinced there was a man in my backyard by the door i saw him i heard the thud and then i saw him i texted my sister multiple times but she was fast asleep as by this point it would ve been around 2am when she didn t answer i was calling my mum shaking and borderline hyperventilating no one was answering me and i gave up and called 000 australia s emergency line they obviously did very well and i managed to walk to the front end of my house as for some reason i felt more secure there maybe an hour later the police called me on a private number just to ask some general questions and they then ended it by saying they ll just do a quick look down the street with their bright lights and they were bright now that it s been over 8 months since then i could probably admit that i don t think there actually was anyone there but i was soooo convinced for an extended amount of time that there was i don t sleep until the sun comes up and it s due to my anxiety i can t get ahold of stable professional help as i simply can t afford it long term i ve been meaning to get ahold of a psychiatrist for my adhd maybe it could be worth looking into some sleep medication or something i just want advice techniques some reassurance i m not even sure if this is the right place to come and i do apologies if it s not it s currently 4:46am and i m just so anxious thank you :,panic_disorder

1pndf1j,where does cleanliness end and ocd begin hi everyone i have a question that comes from deep within me: where is the line between logical cleanliness and obsessive compulsive washing cleaning in my home my mother who is the primary rule maker lives with diagnoses of obsessive compulsive disorder ocd generalized anxiety disorder gad and obsessive compulsive personality disorder ocpd the combination of these three has made her a legislator with good intentions but sometimes without a clear awareness of healthy boundaries i am aware of her obsessions and their impact on me however i have doubts about cleaning washing ocd how can you tell if a behavior is part of a disorder for clarity here are some examples of the rules in our house: washing fruits eggs and food packaging washing all newly purchased clothes before wearing them disinfecting new phones and books with alcohol transferring purchased pastries to a home container placing outside documents like mail or files in a dedicated cabinet and washing hands after each touch showering after using a public restroom or after wearing clothes for shopping it s worth noting: due to alcohol damaging devices and respiratory issues i ve recently developed i sometimes reduce these rituals out of my mother s sight for years i thought this level of cleanliness was the standard everywhere but now after seeing my friends lifestyles i ve noticed a stark difference almost all of them believe that cleaning ocd rules our home why is this question vital to me the household rules probably won t change but as an individual i need to know for my own peace of mind which behaviors are rooted in logic and which are rooted in anxiety this self awareness is the key to gaining control over my own thoughts and worries i feel this contradiction: in others homes i try to act like they do but inside i m full of bad feelings guilt and an incomplete sense of enjoyment i maintain my interactions but you know it s a bit hard i pretend everything is normal i go along with everyone everywhere and do everything but only i know that i m wearing a mask to pretend that nothing is wrong perhaps the problem lies with me even if others aren t ultimately that clean the issue is mine for not feeling comfortable at the normal level of society perhaps the problem is mine for becoming a hindrance when others want to enjoy themselves in the dirtiest of places in the end i don t know what the standard is who defines what is normal and abnormal i need to reach an understanding so i can begin to take mental control this search is essential for my own self awareness i have just one question for you: in your opinion what is the criterion for diagnosing washing cleaning ocd where do you draw the line please share any thought experience or perspective you have big or small even if you don t have a definitive answer just share your personal take on where this invisible line is thank you for taking the time to read my post,generalized_anxiety

1pn9rgp,always on edge and nowhere to reset i am not really sure how to start this but i have been holding all of this in for a long time and i need to let it out somewhere i am someone who genuinely does not have bad intentions toward people i am very naive i trust easily and i often do not realize when people are judging me or manipulating me until it is already done because of that i keep getting misunderstood people assume things about me that are not true and instead of talking to me directly they slowly start avoiding me or distancing themselves what makes it worse is that this happens everywhere i exist at college i constantly feel judged and on edge like i have to watch every word i say and every action i take at home it is not much different there is pressure misunderstanding and a feeling that i am never fully understood these are the only two environments in my life i do not have friends and i do not have even one person i truly trust or feel safe opening up to there is no place where i can relax and just be myself because of this i feel like i am stuck in fight or flight mode all the time my mind is always alert tense and braced for something to go wrong sometimes it honestly feels like i am a nocturnal animal like a rat or a mouse where being out in the open during the day just means getting pounced on i am treated the same at college that stress follows me home and same happens there things are same at home i go to college drained and anxious the same happens it feels like a deadlock that never really breaks the only time i feel some kind of peace is late at night usually past midnight when everything gets quiet and dark there are no expectations no conversations no judgment it is just silence and my mind finally slows down sometimes that scares me because it feels like the only time i actually exist over time this has affected me a lot i think hundred times about what i say or do doubt myself and get gaslighted by my existence and feel like i have to shrink or stay quiet just to avoid problems i feel lonely even when i am surrounded by people i am just emotionally and mentally tired what hurts the most is knowing that i never intent to hurt anyone yet being treated like i did this keeps happening both at home and at college i am starting feeling like something is wrong with me can t express in words i just do not know how to survive when being kind and naive keeps backfiring and there is no one to fall back on when things are always overwhelming and the same i grown up with literally zero friends or a trusted person lived in that constant on edge feeling is feeding of my life,generalized_anxiety

1pn5kfi,what can i do to stop feeling this way and get things done also posted on reposted here because this problem hasn t stopped yet and i think it has more to do with my anxiety rather than my depression but i could be wrong please direct me to another subreddit if you think so i m quite new to reddit so i apologize in advance if the post could feel kinda messy it s the first time i ve felt the need to ask strangers online what to do i m young almost an adult and i ve been suffering from anxiety and depression for a year now with therapy treatment and everything the problem i m starting to face more frequently and intensely is that my mind shuts down when i need to do something no matter if it s work school work a hobby self care etc it has gotten to the point where i cannot get things done for the life of me and instead waste time thinking which results in me doubting my will to go on i keep having no idea why that is i m not the type of person to vent and talk about these things to my friends my best is to lightly joke about them but that s it i also tend to isolate myself when these kinds of episodes happen so that s one more complication i m sure or at least i hope i m not the only one who has to deal with these types of struggles whenever i tried to look for solutions the most common answer i ve found is to start doing what needs to be done and motivation will come along but that has stopped working for me that s why i resorted to asking myself directly what do you think could help move on from this feeling,generalized_anxiety

1pmz25x,anyone else experience anxiety after consuming dairy with lactose intolerance so i 29m have had lactose intolerance since probably middle school for me my symptoms after ingesting dairy was simply diarrhea for the longest time although it was a battle in it of itself however about a month ago all of the sudden now i get anxiety whenever i consume dairy i m not sure if it s the gasses or the inflammation that s causing the anxiety i read that there are studies on the gut brain axis that shows that gut health can directly impact brain function so i feel like perhaps this isn t uncommon and i m not alone in experiencing something like this but i m so confused as to why this is happening to me all of the sudden i m convinced it s the dairy causing the anxiety because after i go to the bathroom anxiety symptoms start resolving my doctor says give it a month of no dairy and try reintroducing it to my diet afterwards little at a time to see if it resolves itself but alas it s been well over a month and it s still happening i wouldn t say it s debilitating but honestly it s been making me really depressed to think i ll never be able to enjoy ice cream or pizza now without experiencing full blown anxiety feeling hot and sweaty mind racing trouble concentrating feeling like something s wrong brain fog trouble remembering things my question is: 1 anyone else experience anxiety with lactose intolerance 2 do you think it s normal for me to suddenly develop this kind of response to lactose after years of simple diarrhea,generalized_anxiety
1pmyqgm,absolutely horrible hypochondria when i showe the bathroom i avoid ever looking down and look straight ahead completely frozen to avoid looking at my body when i lie down on my side i put a very thick layer of blanket underneath to prevent the possibility of feeling something abnormal against my abdomen when laying on the mattress when i feel itchy i avoid scratching it or scratch it with a large brush to avoid feeling something like a lump when touching it when i feel a pain anywhere on my body i cry and start thinking of the cancerous tumor that s probably multiplying and dividing rapidly in the area that s causing the pain whenever i make a spelling or grammatical error i think about how there s probably a brain tumor in my head that s pushing on the area that controls cognitive function and thinking and over the past month i ve at least 15 times mistaken a normal body part like bones muscle fat tendon etc for being a cancerous lump when it really was just a normal anatomical feature it s just getting so bad i ve always had health anxiety but this is the worst it s ever been with this i also have a horrible fear of going to the doctor and avoid it at all costs honestly the idea of going to the doctor for me is the equivalent amount of fear that someone would feel with a grenade being thrown into their room it s just so hard to get past the idea of receiving bad news and to make matters worse my mom dismisses all my health fears and laughs at me when i mention them to her :,generalized_anxiety

1pmxyex,helpful words or tips hello i am 18 f and have been experiencing the worst anxiety attacks of my life recently this all started about a month ago after having a bad experience at a musical festival out of town where i had to be rushed home after day one i had felt my head go cold lost all feeling in my legs couldn t breathe throwing up vision blacking in and out twitching etc and thought i was honestly experiencing a heart attack i had begged to be rushed to the hospital but luckily was able to calm down a bit once i got into my friends bed and drank some water ever since that night i have been dissociating all day and experiencing anxiety attacks every night around 5pm 12am i have experienced similar attacks in the past and have been ruled out for any medical related issues and have even have been on zoloft for about 4 5 years now but it honestly hasn t helped even with my doses being bumped up since becoming an adult even so those attacks came and went whereas these just keep coming back every day i started a second part time job last week and it s honestly been making things harder since i ve been working so late into the night i would just like to ask if anyone has experienced anything similar and what they have done to cope with it what medications have helped you i m just so lost i come on here every night reading posts but still feel dazed i feel like a robot every day and just want to feel normal again thank you for reading sorry for the long message,panic_disorder

1pmwvmj,how do you deal with a narcissist to make a long story short my father has been is textbook narcissist basically his whole life and it s been something that my mom sister and i have had to live with for many years my sister no longer lives here he kicked her out because she didn t go to nursing school he s never really been physically abusive for the most part but he s been a severe mental manipulator and abuser the current situation is that he s angry and giving everyone the silent treatment because it snowed yesterday and my mom said she should go to the store before it gets too bad and he flipped out and of course brought up some other things he decided were bothering him now we re in the stage of the silent treatment for probably around a week until he decides he s no longer angry and will pretend nothing happened i have severely bad anxiety probably due to growing up in a household where we would walk on eggshells constantly and frequently be given the silent treatment for basically no reason i really just don t know what to do i wish i didn t have to live like this but as of right now i just have to stick it out and deal with it we try to enjoy the times where he s actually somewhat nice but that s usually like 75 of the time it used to be much worse where it would be probably 30 nice but it s still absolutely miserable it s so frustrating that you can t even communicate with him like a normal person he will just get angry if you contest anything that is right in his mind he s truthfully nothing more than a cowardly disgusting piece of shit of a human i can t even say that i feel any love for my own father i don t hate him but he s ruined any kind of love that i had for him when he didn t speak to me for 10 years and we lived in the same house any advice would be appreciated thanks for reading,generalized_anxiety

1pmpkqw,significant health anxiety and brain tumor worries hello anxiety reddit i am going through an especially rough spell of health anxiety and could use some strategies and reassurance to help combat my fears of a brain tumor or some type of tumor in my head face ever since i was 8 years old i have suffered from pulsing migraines that happen anywhere from 3 times a month to 3 times a week over time i have learned to live with them but they have been a significant factor in my life for a long time as i am 23 now about 2 years ago i started taking a low dose of amitriptyline which has helped greatly and has reduced the number of headaches i have my last severe headache episode was about 2 years ago when i went to the er for a headache that lasted for 3 days straight they did a ct scan that showed nothing gave me the er migraine cocktail and sent me on my way that provided reassurance for a decent amount of time within the last month or so i ve started having an increase in eye pain which i m not sure is eye strain or something else it feels as though the muscles in my eye are being pulled when i look in a certain direction additionally when i press on my forehead pain radiates down my forehead through my left eye and into my left nostril i had an eye exam a few days after the first episode and my doctor said everything looked very healthy and my prescription needed minimal adjustment again this gave me some piece of mind for a while until the eye pains started again today i am on day two of significant eye pain which again feels like soreness behind the eye i am on screens all day for work and on my phone far too long each day and i am trying everything i can to convince myself that this is just from severe eye strain or other environmental factors i underwent a full panel of bloodwork at the start of september under my primary care doc s orders which showed nothing out of the ordinary however i can t stop my mind from making connections to other symptoms i have had trouble sleeping for the last 6 months or so since my wife and i got married and moved into a new place i feel like i ve been more forgetful recently and maybe that could be related i ve been more fatigued than i feel i usually am ibuprofen doesn t seem to help with the eye pain which comes and goes seemingly at random my mind starts to spiral into all of the different possibilities with the end conclusion being that i should make a trip to the er and get a scan of my head to rule out a brain tumor please please please any suggestions on how to curb my obsessions and endless googling and reassurance that this is my anxiety talking not a growth in my head obviously nobody here is a doctor and can say with 100 certainty i understand that i have lost the last 2 days of my life going down rabbit holes on google and chatgpt and i would like to find some peace and sit down and play a video game without feeling like i need to be researching my symptoms online thank you all in advance,generalized_anxiety

1pmlonm,my partner struggles with anxiety and overthinking and this is what s been helping recently my partner has been dealing with anxiety and constant overthinking for quite a while now it doesn t always show up as panic attacks most of the time it s racing thoughts difficulty switching off at night and feeling mentally exhausted for no clear reason we ve tried a lot of things together over time breathing exercises journaling routines even just sitting quietly and talking things through some of it helped some of it didn t stick what s been surprisingly helpful recently is having something very simple to reach for in the moment especially when their thoughts start spiralling and they don t want a long exercise or a full conversation i ended up putting together a small app mainly so they could quickly do a short breathing reset feel gentle vibration cues and just dump what s in their head without overthinking it it s not therapy and it s not a cure but it s helped them slow down and feel a bit more grounded in those moments i m sharing this here because i know a lot of people deal with similar day to day anxiety and overthinking if anyone s interested i m happy to share what we ve been using in the comments and if this post isn t appropriate here mods please feel free to remove,panic_disorder

1pmkwaa,panic attacks with intense heart sensations exhausted and looking for support ai improved this as english is not my native language this started one evening when i woke up with a sudden sharp pain in my trapezius muscle not long after i woke up sweating and shaking completely convinced i was having a heart attack and was going to die looking back it was my first major panic attack i rushed to the hospital bp and ecg were normal they told me i was fine but i didn t feel fine the panic attacks kept coming after multiple visits i tested positive for h pylori and my diagnoses was stomach ulcers gas bloating and constant burping i later realized i had been mistaking many of these sensations for heart problems what scares me most is how my heart and chest feel during panic sometimes my heart beats very fast sometimes very loudly and i become extremely aware of every beat in my chest and neck i also get sudden electric like zaps or jolts on the left side of my chest sometimes with sharp pain it feels wrong like something isn t working properly and that sensation alone sends me into full panic along with this my legs often feel weak shaky or unstable like they might give out during an attack that loss of physical confidence makes the fear even worse a few days before all this started i quit nicotine pouches zyn after previously smoking and i wonder if withdrawal played a role in triggering this anxiety spiral i m currently on digestive medication and anxiety medication even so panic attacks still happen overwhelming fear chest discomfort sharp or electric sensations strange muscle feelings weakness and a cold burning sensation around my neck and arms mostly on the left side in those moments reassurance doesn t help because everything feels dangerously real i feel like my body is stuck in constant danger mode the hardest part is that every panic attack brings thoughts of death my father passed away 8 9 months ago and i never properly processed it i stayed strong for everyone else now when panic hits my mind immediately jumps to thoughts of my own death convinced something is being missed or that i won t recover doctors say it s anxiety stress a hyper alert nervous system and unresolved grief but it s taking over my life i m in my final year of university and instead of focusing on my future i m fighting my body and mind every single day i just want to feel normal again i want to feel safe inside my own body i m exhausted if anyone has experienced panic attacks with strong physical symptoms especially heart sensations electric chest pains shaky legs stomach issues or anxiety linked to grief i would really appreciate hearing what helped you cope or feel safer again,panic_disorder

1pmixkd,time anxiety hi everyone for a long time i ve struggled with time anxiety but not in the existential type of way where i m afraid of the passage of time itself although i m not entirely sure that doesn t play a role but for me the bottom line is: anytime i have to do something that is unrelated to whatever productive thing or hobby i actually want to do i start feeling anxious about how much time i have left to complete the unrelated thing and how to maximize the time remaining to do the desired thing most often it is related to when i want to write my passion so an example could be today: i m meal prepping and cleaning the house and i know i want to write something for a ttrpg campaign later so every part of meal prepping and cleaning the house feels like a distraction and like something stealing away the time i have to be productive it s messing with my head quite a bit the result is that i don t live in the moment often i m always thinking of the next part and maximizing my time i m really curious if other people experience this and how they go about dealing with it it would be a way for me to understand my own version of it better,social_anxiety

1pmaqce,need some help and suggestions: hii just to give y all background info i m a 21 year old female i ve been experiencing dizziness lightheadedness on and off for 2 years now it started around dec 2023 but that was attributed more towards my vitamin levels being off and my pcod flaring up causing my periods to not come for almost 4 months after having medication for both these issues the dizziness was solved to some extent and became more manageable i had a bit of an episode around aug 2024 and visited an ent but nothing came out of it he thought i may have meniers since i was also having slight tinnitus but the tests we did for it didn t show that that was a possibility things really escalated around nov 2024 when i had my first panic attack my dizziness lightheadedness became constant along with some gerd like symptoms i was then diagnosed with anxiety mainly health and panic disorder i was on anti anxiety medication up until june of this year i was much better during that period and was doing good after finishing my course of medication until about a month and a half ago my lightheadedness has become more constant along with persistent neck pain so i visited an orthopedist i thought that a major thing that could be causing my recent spell of lightheadedness was the neck pain but the doctor said that the neck pain is nothing major so no nerve issues so he advised that i should go see an ent again visited a different ent this time she heard all my symptoms which at the moment include dizziness lightheadedness neck pain this weird band like headache from time to time slight issues with vision including adjusting to light or an overstimulating environment overall tiredness disorientation and said that i probably have vestibular migraine so she has started me on a magnesium supplement tryptomer 10mg which contains amitriptyline and inderal la 20mg which contains propranolol these medicines didn t really help and my dizziness continued so my ent told me to start a 10 day course of clonazepam 0 25 mg all my symptoms felt so much better with that she then has put me on fluoxetine 20mg for a week now but i m feeling worse now i m feeling the head pressure lightheadedness stomach issues and just feeling very emotionally off since starting this new course i also do therapy once a week pls give me some suggestions and tips for how i should proceed i ve been dealing with this anxiety for more than a year now and more than anything it s these physical symptoms that really bother me,panic_disorder
1pmam4l,i honestly have no idea if it s anxiety or real health issues anymore in the last month or so really since about the beginning of november i have been stuck in a loop of different physical symptoms i ve been having a worse and worse time with every single thing that raises my heart rate in any way it started with jogging it got harder for me so i stopped doing it but i was also having stomach diaphragm issues at the time but it s slowly been getting worse to where even moving furniture climbing stairs and getting excited disappointed or angry gets my heart rate up or makes me feel out of breath or makes me nauseous the left side of my neck has been stiff the last few days and my arm feels like that pain when you ve hit your elbow you know the one although that had been persistent for atleast 2 years i work in an office and my elbow is on the desk all day not all of it is all the time mind you but one of those i had a dream last night that i was walking down an upward escalator and that made me wake up out of breath and with my heart rate up none of this seems good at all except i went to a cardiologist a week ago friday dec 5th and i had bloodwork echo and an ekg done before the echo everything was completely within normal boundaries am i going crazy like since then i almost had a 1 vehicle crash on the highway which made my heart rate skyrocket although nothing happened just got scared and that s it is it enough to ruin my heart since those tests is there any other tests i should get is it the anxiety again is it the stomach issues irritating nerves all over my body i have no idea anymore this same period has also been terrible for me in terms of stress i also had a few moments of great physical exertion due to overcompensating relationship issues with physical labor the top one being carrying a 20kg car battery about half a kilometer cause i got angry that my battery died and just decided to buy a new one nearby and carry it back i especially haven t been the same since then although supposedly i recovered physically so basically it s been so much shit i don t even known if it s the anxiety or something physcial anymore and if it is physical what do i even need to do what specialist do i go to should i get any more heart checkp ups i don t wanna label very tangible physical suffering as anxiety and miss something at the same time i know how much worse anxiety can make physical symptoms and i know how very real psycosomatic symtoms are especially if you re a professional hypochondriac like me need advice please,panic_disorder

1pltji9,my experience with weight change on sertraline timelines specifics i spent a long time searching forums for clear comparable experiences around weight gain on sertraline and how long it took to reverse after stopping so i m sharing my own experience in case it helps someone else looking for data points rather than reassurance background female 35 naturally slim my whole life 5ft 6 pre children: 8 stone technically underweight for my height unable to gain weight post children pre sertraline: stable at 8 8 stone highest my weight would increase to was 8 10 stone long standing water retention previously only in legs and manageable by limiting very carby foods i have 2 dogs so i walked a lot but i never spent time actively exercising on sertraline started sertraline: october 2023 initially i lost weight: by early december 2023 i was 8 stone 5 then i had rapid weight gain: by mid december 2023 early january 2024: my weight increased to 9 stone my new weight fluctuated around 9 5 stone 9 9 stone heaviest recorded weight: 9 12 stone although this weight range is medically in healthy range for my height it was significantly higher than my lifelong baseline pattern of weight gain weight gain appeared hormonal in nature distribution was uneven: upper body remained unchanged weight and fluid accumulation primarily from abdomen downward i developed abdominal water retention which i had never experienced before dietary strategies that had previously controlled water retention lower carb intake became ineffective i experienced increased cravings for sugary and fatty foods assumed medication related though intake did not significantly change prior to sertraline i could eat freely and reduce carbohydrates for 1 2 days to manage water retention this strategy no longer worked maintaining baseline physical activity had no effect on weight or fluid retention motivation for exercise reduced significantly i walked the dogs because i had to not because i wanted to stopping sertraline stopped sertraline: 9th may 2025 post discontinuation timeline may 2023 october 2025: no meaningful weight change despite stopping medication weight and water retention remained the same no immediate reduction in bloating or abdominal fluid exercise factor began running: june 2025 the motivation behind this was body image distress rather than fitness goals outcome: running did not lead to weight loss or reduction in water retention in the short or medium term no visible or measurable change while hormones were likely still adjusting my view: exercise may now be supporting weight loss but it did not trigger it the change appears more closely linked to hormonal normalisation over time when weight began to shift first noticeable change: november 2025 approx 6 months after stopping sertraline current weight 8 12 stone change was gradual rather than sudden suggests delayed hormonal recalibration rather than calorie exercise driven weight loss key takeaways from my experience weight gain on sertraline can be delayed hormonal and water retention heavy weight may persist months after discontinuation exercise alone may not override hormonally driven weight changes for me meaningful change did not occur until hormones had time to stabilise posting this because i couldn t find many experiences that included: long term timelines hormonal suggestions water retention changes delayed post discontinuation changes weight gain in someone without prior weight issues i hope this helps anyone looking for comparable data for context i m very pro medication i have gad and panic disorder and sertraline was necessary at the time to stabilise my nervous system enough to engage in therapy it was effective and helped me through a severe period if i were to relapse i would take sertraline again without hesitation i m sharing this purely for informed consent reasons weight gain wasn t something i felt prepared for and knowing in advance that it could be hormonally driven and persist after stopping would have helped me manage expectations and cope better with the physical changes,social_anxiety

1plt34z,is this health anxiety or should i get more tests done details inside this will be a bit long description thanks for reading i m 32 years old with no significant past health conditions though my mother is a type 2 diabetic and my father had blood pressure issues and underwent angioplasty about 20 years ago over the past 3 4 months i ve experienced multiple episodes of waking up in the middle of the night with a racing heart the initial episodes were quite distressing as it was a new experience for me and i even had one during the day these incidents led me to become hyper aware of any changes in my heart rate at all times i started constantly checking my pulse trying to assess whether my heart was racing or if it was normal even the slightest sensation in my chest made me worry that something was wrong with my heart i became overly sensitive to any heart related sensations in more recent episodes i ve learned to manage the situation better i reassure myself that it will pass lie in bed breathe deeply a few times and slowly my heart rate returns to normal so far i don t have any other symptoms during these episodes no shortness of breath dizziness or anything else however sometimes i feel some bloating near the stomach diaphragm area which makes me wonder if my symptoms could be related to poor lifestyle habits especially around sleep and dinner which may be affecting my circadian rhythm here s why i think that might be the case: for the past 3 years i ve averaged only about 6 hours of sleep per night i often get caught in overthinking certain aspects of my life which causes mild anxiety though nothing too serious i typically have dinner around 10 pm go to bed at 1:30 or 2 am and often scroll through social media before falling asleep i ve also noticed that i snore which makes me wonder if there might be some breathing obstruction causing me to wake up with a racing heart however i can t confirm if i ve always snored or if i ve had previous episodes of waking up like this without paying much attention also 4 out of 10 times i ve been having some kind of dream though i m not sure if it s a nightmare when i wake up with the racing heart i ve had blood work done three times this year and the latest results were normal in terms of hemoglobin lipid profile cholesterol triglycerides etc and other parameters the only concern was my high sensitivity crp which came back at 4 56 anything above 3 is considered high i consulted a cardiologist with these results but i feel like he didn t fully understand my situation he prescribed beta blockers for anxiety and blood pressure but i feel the prescription was based more on my blood pressure reading during the appointment which was 149 88 and a heart rate of 117 i think those readings were influenced by my anxiety about seeing the doctor and i don t believe they accurately reflect my usual condition additionally the nurse who took my blood pressure didn t seem to pay attention to my posture and she took the reading three times the cardiologist also mentioned that my circadian rhythm might be off due to my poor sleep and dinner habits i chose not to take the prescribed medications and instead sought a second opinion from an experienced family member who works in pathology he advised against taking the blood pressure medications since i don t have high blood pressure he suggested that i could take amitriptyline in a very mild dose if needed but only as a last resort this whole experience has led to increased health anxiety and now i m afraid of going anywhere alone any time i feel a twitch or unexplained pain in my chest i immediately worry it s something related to my heart i d appreciate any advice from people who ve overcome similar situations thanks to everyone who took the time to read this long post and offer their advice,generalized_anxiety

1plrpgf,difficulty inhaling and exhaling tight chest anxiety hi i wanted to share my experience and if anyone has a solution or has gone through the same thing it would be very helpful from my first episode of tachycardia i felt like i was getting tired faster as i had more episodes i felt like my chest was getting harder to breathe i still couldn t understand it and as the episodes continued and time passed i started to feel my chest and even my back tightening more it was progressive which makes me get tired more easily i ve had generalized anxiety for three months now and it s become a bigger problem it s constantly the case that i don t feel like i can breathe properly when i inhale and exhale it feels too slow like there s a blockage it doesn t let the air in or out and it feels heavy it also makes it difficult to speak and the air constantly hits my throat which has irritated it but it seems muscular because when i do a stretch i feel like my breathing gets really tight before i went for walks when i could still do them and i felt like the more i walked the easier my breathing became but i felt like there were lumps in my chest and back when i breathed like there was a blockage there s a lump there that jumps with my steps when i walk lately i feel it s getting worse and now it causes a sensation in my nose and shortness of breath when i walk a lot yes it feels like i can t fill my lungs completely it s worth noting that i ve already had several health tests if anyone has experienced something similar it would be helpful to know about their experience thanks in advance community,generalized_anxiety

1plpj3b,gad or hormonal mess a bit of context after a massive panic attack in october i came off the pill after 4 years the same month assuming the panic attack was hormonally triggered i pieced it together eventually and it was caused because i accidentally took a sertraline tablet instead of a paracetamol in the night and the unexpected brain zaps terrified me into panic the doctor then put me on citalopram for a week thinking i had gad before i worked it out and that was making me vomit daily so i naturally stopped taking that the doctor then forced me onto the mini pill for around 3 weeks last month after finding endo i was an absolute wreck heavy bleeding for 9 days and crazy heart palpitations so i came off that i m just assuming my body hasn t had one opportunity to settle after such big emotion shifts in such little time i m not anxious mentally im fine but the physical anxiety symptoms are ruining my life the stomach churning the air hunger the general uncomfortableness in my body not to mention the crying over every slight inconvenience i ve always been an emotional person anyway but this is crazy the sleeping patterns too i can wake up like 5 times in the night it only seems to hit at the same time every day pretty much never when i m at work never when i m distracted always in the evening or night i ve had some good days of calm multiple in a row with 0 symptoms and brilliant sleep i ve never really suffered with anxiety and i know my panic attack was caused by actual fear of something not out of nowhere but i just want to know if this is something i shouldn t be labelling as hormonal i m week 3 into the journey of 0 pills in my body so i know im very early into it compared to the 8 weeks of non stop pill popping my body has been through all my bloods have came back fine but i don t want to see another doctor for them to put me on another tablet and send me out the door i haven t had a proper period yet either i just hope i dont sound absolutely insane writing this,panic_disorder

1plnfgp,life after gad did anyone here take paxil for gad i was diagnosed with gad and depression 3 years ago and was prescribed paxil i took it for 8 months and it did magic for my anxiety but i had to stop it because i gained so much weight my psychiatrist told me to try to stop completely without replacing it with another medication which i did and even after stopping it my anxiety got so much better i m still doing therapy and i still get anxious but it s much better than before after stopping l i went through a rollercoaster of emotions where i would just start crying uncontrollably but this lasted only for one month and got much better afterwards however after more time i started to feel that my whole life changed like i became more connected to myself now that the anxiety was gone but i was still feeling my emotions very intensely i m working with my therapist to try to identify emotions as i couldn t do this when my anxiety was present i went through a lot of hard times last year and they affected me a lot but i also found myself having obsessive tendencies and couldn t regulate my emotions at all i would fall into cycles of obsessing over a thought sometimes for days without being able to think or talk about anything else it became a bit too much on my friends and my partner but no matter how much i tried i couldn t break the cycles until i got very burned out and i feel that when my anxiety was worse my emotions were more under control but now i can t control them at all i can t even do the things that used to help me before like writing or listening to music i don t know if this makes sense or if it s related to the treatment or it s related to the events that happened last year but i ve never felt like this in my whole life has anyone had a similar experience with gad and paxil,generalized_anxiety

1plj4wy,which anxiety med actually didn t make you gain weight i understand it s different for everybody and a very subjective question nevertheless i m curious to hear your longterm experiences taking a medication that packs on the pounds would ironically make my mental health worse i recognize that it sounds vain but i know myself and i m sure many others feel the same way anyways i m curious to hear your longterm experiences with a weight neutral anxiety medication i m not necessarily talking about benzos or anything that you take as needed but rather something that you take daily with that being said this isn t limited to first line anxiety meds either i ve had good experiences with adhd med and beyond i would love to hear from you all,panic_disorder

1pliw2b,i trauma dumped on a stranger and it led to emotional fallout and public humiliation cw: suicidal ideation i 28f was desperate for connection after losing my job and meeting this man 37m in may while suicidal we trauma bonded and hooked up that night over the next months i repeatedly pursued him despite his vagueness driven by a deep need for validation during a severe mental health crisis i called him he immediately said he was not attracted to me despite him asking me the next day after we hooked up to come back and two weeks before the fight he wanted me to come over and asked if i was seeking attention when we met he became aggressive yelling calling me annoying as f ck revealing the hook up was a drunken mistake and walking out mid crisis it was because i kept asking for reassurance and wanting to hook up which makes me feel like a creep in shock i posted the situation on the awdtsg page because i needed some validation and support someone sent him a screenshot of the post and he then threatened me with a lawsuit said very vile and hurtful things called me a liar and blocked me however the post revealed he has a history of emotional abuse harassment and an undisclosed std i am now consumed by regret blaming myself for pursuing him asking for reassurance and posting the information feeling like a stalker predator and manipulator this pain is unbearable and i have withdrawn completely feeling closer to ending my life every day,social_anxiety

1plikhy,unsure what to do about a decision i made i bought an iphone 17 last sunday to replace my se i ve been questioning whether it was worth the price of upgrading though and have been thinking about returning the 17 and going back to my se i ve been weighing up the pros and cons: : i could afford it still living at home save money every month : battery and camera are better : i could put the money towards something better e g a newer car since mine fogs ups really badly : i m not a photagrapher take more screenshots than pictures and i got around the battery issues with my se by using a power pack : i m interested in the iphone fold that is supposed to be coming out next year obviously no one knows what it s going to be like though could wait until september and it s not very good or doesn t suit me but i m also struggling with fear of my family: as i said i m still living at home i feel like my mum and sister would disapprove of me returning it it makes me anxious and dissuades me from returning the phone at the same time i am aware that it is influencing me and that feels wrong this has been playing on my mind a lot this week does anyone have any thoughts edit: i forgot to say as well i m quite anxious about how difficult it will be to transfer my data back to my se or if something goes wrong after i transferred to my new phone and changed sim card i just turned my se off rather than wipe it,panic_disorder
1pli5yo,does anyone else with ocd feel dumb or mentally blocked when anxiety hits hi everyone i m wondering if others here experience something similar one of the most frustrating parts of my ocd is that when an intrusive thought appears my anxiety spikes very quickly when that happens i don t just feel anxious but mentally and verbally blocked it feels like: i can t think clearly i stumble over words when speaking my speech feels awkward or unnatural when typing or texting every sentence feels off i make more typos or misspell words more easily i become hyper aware of how i sound or write it s like anxiety temporarily shuts down my brain and i start worrying that i look or sound stupid so i m curious: does anyone else experience this cognitive communication shutdown during ocd anxiety if so how do you cope with it in the moment have you found anything that helps long term i d really appreciate hearing from others who deal with something similar many thanks,generalized_anxiety
1plhyt5,two years of medication five years of therapy still at the same place this may be a bit odd post but i am looking for suggestions on what other approaches can i try a bit of context before that: since i became a father i have crippling anxiety regarding the health of my children every time they get a fever i get panic attacks and severe anxiety i also start showing obsessive behaviour such as checking temperature of my kids every 10 minutes when they are ill i also get super worried taking to the doctor in fear that they might diagnose something serious interestingly the trigger for this behaviour is primarily fever i don t have a problem taking my kids to the dentist or worry so much for a physical injury but a fever triggers a fear or unknown and lack of control and i spiral unfortunately young kids fall ill a lot as their immunity is developing so this has made life hell for me and family for last 5 years i have been seeking psychiatric help for this condition i was put on ssris for two years which definitely helped and then the doctor weaned me off saying i only need therapy i have been in therapy on and off for 5 years i have gone through everything from it is normal for parents to worry about their kids to looking at childhood issues that can be causing such strong reactions i have been practising cognitive behaviour therapy meditation spirituality everything but nothing has brought any meaningful improvement two different psychiatrists and therapists have said that i don t need treatment anymore and i can manage unfortunately as soon as one of the kids start coughing and the thermometer shows fever all the anxiety panic and crippling worry rushes back i am looking for advice if there are any alternate treatments i can try as the traditional methods have not brought any meaningful change it s really affecting my ability to function as a good father and i am already noticing my anxiety is rubbing off of my kids negatively personal life is hell as well and my wife is fed up,panic_disorder

1plbuhb,can t handle the dentist anymore and my teeth are dying i have been cavity prone my whole life and i ve had severe irreversible dental decay for 5 years i m a smoker and i ve had arfid for 17 years due to my arfid i ve been repeatedly getting new cavities every single year since i was a kid and i m in my 20 s now i ve had more fillings and root canals in my life than i can count but every single dentist appointment they are always finding new cavities that developed since my last appointment i geniuenly can t remember the last time they said i didn t have any cavities i also have a half grey tooth that has also been half grey since 2022 despite it being pain free for three years now all of a sudden it hurts like hell surprisingly even though i still have a ton of cavities inside my whole mouth none if my other teeth hurt i currently have 10 cavities all throughout my mouth some of these cavities i got filled earlier this year and some i ve had since 2022 the smoking isn t helping either i know unlike the arfid the smoking is my fault but thankfully i have nicotine patches and i m hoping to be a non smoker again in a few weeks all my other teeth are still pain free but my one half grey tooth is now suddenly hurting so bad it s making it hard to eat and talk whenever i move my cheek too high it hurts really bad i have to make as minimal lip movement as possible when i eat or talk and i have to chew on the other side if i accidentally chew on that side or accidentally move my mouth wrong while talking it hurts i also have a hard time yawning so being tired or bored is kinda awful rn because whenever i yawn it inevitably hurts due to the cheek movement but the cheek movement just makes the pain worse to the point i m visibly in pain the pain is always there even when my mouth isn t moving at all its just mild without the cheek movement clearly i need to go to the dentist and possibly even get this tooth extracted depending on how dead it is rn but my dentist anxiety is so severe i cannot handle it and some dentists can t even handle it every time i ve tried to go to the dentist at my most recent appointments i shake and gag uncontrollably almost the entire time to the point where it s extremely embarrassing for me and makes it very hard for dentists to work on me because i can t stay still and gag whenever tools go in my mouth at certain angles dentists often have to wing it with limited dental x rays when deciding treatment for me because i can t get through even the x rays properly because i can t stop gagging when the chip enters my mouth and then whenever they need to do an actual procedure due to the uncontrollable tremor and senstive gag reflex i ve had dentists have to stop the procedure early because they couldn t work on me only really good and really patient and really experienced dentists can finish a procedure on me and it s still hard for them to because they sometimes get slightly frustrated with me and keep telling me to try and control my breathing even though that clearly doesn t help i actually got dropped by my local dentist because they couldn t complete even basic procedures on me and so i had to switch to a dentist 10 miles away since it s the second closest one that takes my insurance i was put on laughing gas once but it actually made things even worse because i know this isn t a typical reaction so idk why i reacted this way to the nitrous but for some reason the laughing gas masked the effects of the localized anesthesia so i felt the pain during the procedure and started crying that was the only time i ever felt pain during a dental procedure was when i was on laughing gas so never again i was also still highly intoxicated as i was leaving i seemed really drunk the only reason they let me leave was because someone was with me most people begin to sober up the second they re taken off the mask but it didn t wear off for me until a full 30 minutes later the localized anesthesia they inject into my mouth effectively blocks out any pain during any procedure so i typically do not feel any pain so i m never nervous about pain since i know it won t be that painful so that isn t what causes my tremors and gagging it is purely just a physiological reaction to the sensory input the sensory overload from the extremely loud and distressing noise of the tools right in my face make me begin to feel super anxious which then gives me the tremors and the gagging is just because i have an extremely sensitive gag reflex i gag when yawning or even when just brushing my teeth it could play a part in my arfid because i will actually throw up when i taste something i don t like which is why i can t tolerate most foods or some medications the fear of the nausea is what leads to me eating less than 10 foods and its almost all junk food and some of it is acidic or carbonated hence the repeated cavities i always get year after year i ve also tried noise canceling headphones but it doesn t work and then my headphones broke by having it on my neck for so many hours while i was out and so i had to get brand new headphones so at this point some dentists literally can t work on me because i m just too difficult and i literally can t get through an appointment because everything about the reactions and dentists getting frustrated with me and the possibility of wasting my time taking the train to the dentist just to not even be able to get much done it all just gives me way too much anxiety since even laughing gas failed there is absolutely no way to get through dental treatment except generalized anesthesia i truly believe the only way me and most dentists will be able to do it now is if they just fully sedate me if they fr just fully put me under so i don t negatively physically react anymore unfortunately this is not possible because my insurance won t cover it because they don t believe it s medically necessary and they only cover what they see is medically necessary and their version of medically necessary is they literally only cover root canals on some teeth not all so i ve had to settle for fillings on some teeth that need root canals

1pl90ew,i need help to determine if i had a panic attack i want to preface this by saying i haven t ever had a panic attack before and so am completely unaware of the actual feelings or i guess process of it but here goes well firstly i felt very hot this was the first thing i noticed when leaving my room as it was hot inside i had my jacket and a jumper on and i could feel i was getting almost too hot and couldn t cool down then i felt a tightness in my chest whilst driving as i couldn t cool down then i felt just like something was wrong i can t put my finger on it but something was wrong with me and during this it s like something hit me i became so crucially self aware of myself almost like i was so aware that it became incredibly overwhelming this felt like too much followed by my i think usual chest pains which doctors claim to be lactic acid very likely which then caused like a pulsating through my body like i was trying to jump out of my skin like my body was trying to be extremely quickly sick like it was trying to jump out of me whilst not really being incredibly nauseous and this pulsating jumped through my body a few times before i called my partner speaking i felt like i struggled to speak like my words weren t very clear and my voice was shaky i had this for about 10 minutes during my drive to boots chemist to check this out as it was on the way to where i was driving but during all of this i just felt like something was very very wrong with me i can t really explain that feeling and that feeling of something wrong with me felt like it was going to be a heart attack i m only 27 how daft i also felt like i was going to faint however i haven t fainted before so i don t know what that feels like so it may not have been that it s taken me a good 6 7 hours to feel relatively normal again it s just the pulsating felt like my body was about to slump i can t remember much else but that fear i m struggling to forget since then i ve had a pain in my left chest but i usually have a sort of pain like i mentioned with lactic acid all of this is quite hard to put into words so i m just sort of confused with what happened to me oh i should mention it also seems to have been brought on by flicker of rain on my windshield it was raining so so lightly and it was almost as if these freckles of rain were overwhelming me like there was such a heavy focus on them that i couldn t get away from again i can t really explain it the hyper awareness sort of brought that on i don t have panic attacks i ve never had one never fainted and i m confused if anyone can help it would actually mean a lot thank you for taking the time to read,panic_disorder

1pl8xvz,how to appear less anxious tldr specifically in a work setting i ve been at my current place of work for 2 5 years and it s my first real job that isn t independent contractor stripping so my first time having a real boss that isn t just a guy i pay house fees to and coworkers that aren t all drunk i ve been doing well enough made normal friendships with my coworkers and say hi to management but that s about it well a few months ago they brought in more management and supervisors and they liked me and promoted me to fill another supervisor roll so now i m being trained for that and i realize my anxiety may be making me appear less confidant than i d like i don t remember how i handled it when i first started but now i am hyper aware of never knowing what to do with my hands i find myself playing with my necklace rings hair clasping and unclasping my hands etc as my manager is training me i just think it must be super obvious at a glance that i m anxious and nervous or even worse because two of the managers are men i ll be seen by them or my coworkers as like flirting i ve read that when people are interested in someone they ll play with their hair and stuff that s definitely not the case but just things i ve been feeling embarrassed about lol any advice is appreciated,social_anxiety

1pl3t7h,it ll pass 3 hey everyone approx 2 years ago i had a really bad weed induced anxiety or panic i am not sure tbh attack and was convinced i was having a heart attack and that i was about to die i ve never had anxiety panic attack before until that time i developed a fear about having heart attack after that day whenever my heart rate increased even a tiny bit my whole focus would shift to my chest i d check my bpm several times a day my hands would get sweaty all the time couldn t focus on anything etc it sucked real hard after the cardiologist visit and wearing a holter for 2 3 days i was certain that it was pyschological from that day on i kept telling myself it s all in your head you won t die today every time i felt bad btw after that anxiety attack i realized i was also afraid of death and that s something i still work on today internally in my case it wasn t about just my heart today i realized it s been around a year since i last worried about my heart and i can smoke again without my heart going crazy during that time i was seeking comfort from here occasionally by reading what other people are going through so maybe this ll comfort someone: it s a temporary situation and it ll pass first you need to eliminate the physical conditions and considering you are probably an average young person trust me it s really unlikely you to die from a heart attack don t let it control your life try to observe as it happens just observe don t react you know it s all in your head so there is no need to feed that negative loop don t try to run away from it either it s a part of you that you need to work on it even though it s said easier than done with time it gets easier it ll take different time for everyone since everyone is different but i assure it ll pass one day also little side note before all of that i thought people were exaggerating it about anxiety panic attacks and i was thinking them as weak people oh boy was i wrong lol,panic_disorder

1pl3aq5,extreme anxiety around over consumption consumerism i honestly don t know where this anxiety comes from but i ve had it since i was an adult and it keeps getting worse and worse older i get i have extreme anxiety about over consuming or buying things that i don t need or use enough it causes extreme decision paralysis for me that makes me spiraling to overthinking before i can make a simple purchase one big example for me is shoes i m trying to learn how to dress better and find my personal style right now the only shoes i own are two pairs of sneakers a work shoe and a snow boot i want to buy more shoes so that i can style my outfits more intentionally but when i think about a pair of shoes i might like i start getting really freaked out and worrying about what if i don t wear them enough what if they only go with a couple of my outfits and i only wear them one or two times a month logically i know that even if i m not wearing them all that often i m still using them and they re not a waste but emotionally it feels like if i m not using something constantly all the time then i m wasting it insulation shouldn t even bother getting something unless i m absolutely certain i m going to use it all the time the thing i m worried so much about right now is a water bottle i just ordered a new bag which i know that i need because right now the only bag i have is a tote and the inside pocket broke and it s starting to fall apart but the problem is that i don t think the bag is big enough to fit my 24 ounce water bottle on top of everything else i need to fit so then i m like maybe i need to buy a 16 ounce water bottle which will fit in the bag better but then i think to myself that if i use the 16 ounce bottle in the bag all the time that i m never gonna use the 24 ounce water bottle and then i m being wasteful it s like every single thing that i bought i had to think through every scenario which i might use it and make sure that i m gonna be enough but by some arbitrary standard honestly i just get anxious thinking about how much stuff there is on this earth that no one needs or uses and i think i internalize it too much but i don t know how to make it stop does anyone else feel this way how can i talk myself down,generalized_anxiety

1pkx4qg,best supplements for daytime anxiety for context i have been struggling on and off with anxiety for the past several months i get these days where i just feel constant fear it has no obvious trigger it s not like i m nervous about anything coming up later that day i just feel uncomfortable and scared for no clear reason it s made it difficult for me to function at work since i struggle to just sit still in the past i used alcohol to self medicate for this i was taking shots throughout the day just to keep myself at bay but this eventually resulted in me getting a detox and going sober so what supplements would you recommend for me to use to just feel calmer i ve tried cbd cbg valerian root and ashwagandha pills and while these do help it s only mild is there something i m missing out on are there specific forms of the aforementioned supplements that are best as a side note my theory is that finding something to keep myself calm will help deter the potential of a relapse,panic_disorder

1pkw5mp,driving anxiety returned after accident i ve struggled with severe driving anxiety resulting in me only getting my license this past summer at age 26 shortly after i got a job that requires a half hour commute on the highway there is no public transit option i was doing it and things were going pretty well until we had our first real snowfall of the season it was that sort of weather where the snow is half sticking half melting i m still not entirely sure what exactly happened but on a bend in the road at highway speeds i lost control of my car it slid left then right then left again across the oncoming lane of traffic and into the ditch thank god no one was hurt nothing was hit and my car wasn t even damaged however the ditch was too steep to drive out of so i had to call for a winch in the moment itself i was actually pretty calm but the aftermath is that this has destroyed my confidence in driving what fucks me up is that a i still don t really know what caused me to lose control like that and b things could have been so much worse braking had zero effect until i was off the road in the ditch which was grassy i lost control of my car it was only luck that no other cars were around to be hit thank god no one was hurt and my car wasn t even damaged i missed work that day but had to go in the next the whole day i felt like i was falling apart like no one understood or cared how scared i was and how hopeless i feel however taxing i found regular driving winter driving is 1000x worse i ve gone back to asking my parents to ride with me because i m afraid of doing it by myself and i absolutely hate losing that independence i hate that independence requires driving but that s another rant for another post i ve made peace with the fact that most of my anxieties are irrational like being afraid of talking on the phone is objectively pretty silly and i can accept that but driving is something that seems completely rational to fear and this incident has only reinforced it in this instance i feel like i m the sane one and it s everyone else who s crazy why are people okay with piloting around giant hunks of metal at high speeds when it objectively leads to thousands of accidents and injuries every year why do people just accept this as part of life i genuinely do not understand it the only advice people give me is to get back on the road how every time i start feeling confident in myself that s when things go wrong,social_anxiety
1pkw0qa,had my first anxiety attack in years this week post title is pretty much the tldr i had my first proper anxiety attack in 10 years this week and now i m worried that i might be regressing tw: mention of emetophobia fear of vomit being sick i got some last minute theatre tickets with my family and on the day of i woke up feeling a little nervous about it this was a familiar feeling as the theatre has been a big trigger for me in the past i think it s something about the sense of feeling trapped and like i can t easily get out if i wanted to i have also struggled with emetophobia in the past so there is also an element of worrying about feeling a need to be sick and not being able to get to a bathroom in time i tried to push the anxiety away but as the day went on i started feeling worse and by the time i made it to my seat that evening i could feel my heart going a million miles an hour i tried sipping on a bottle of water and practising deep breaths but nothing was helping eventually the nerves became outright panic and i didn t even make it to the end of act 1 before practically bolting from my seat thankfully our row was quite empty so i was able to get out quickly some staff members responded very quickly to check on me while i was hiding in the bathroom and i told them what had happened and they were very kind and offered to get me some water and a different seat nearer to the exit i reunited with my family at the interval and they were really worried asking if i wanted to go home but i brushed them off and assured them i was okay i did move to a seat at the end of the row and thankfully was able to finish watching the show but the experience has nonetheless really rattled me as i said in the first paragraph i have not experienced such intense anxiety symptoms in at least 10 years back in february i went to a different theatre production and sat right in the middle of a sold out show with next to no legroom either side of me and was absolutely fine back in september i did experience something similar on a plane as we were approaching to land again with that anxiety about feeling trapped in my seat fear of being sick meaning i had to wake up the person sat next to me to make another dash to the bathroom to calm down i am now really worried that this anxiety is going to become an issue for me again it nearly ruined my life before i could barely get on a bus or a train without feeling panic i fought like hell to get past it back then and i have absolutely zero idea what might be bringing it back now does anyone have any advice on what i might be able to do to prevent further attacks or if there might be some deeper psychological thing i need to work through i have been feeling quite tense recently due to stress at work plus tensions with my family meaning that home doesn t feel like a relaxing environment so i wonder if this could be a manifestation of that thank you for reading,generalized_anxiety

1pksp55,trigger warning: symptoms and potential diagnosis hi whoever reads this i hope you are well if you have seen my previous posts they are still there if not you will be able to see that my anxiety started a few weeks ago now and the physical symptoms have ruined my life i have been to the doctors 7 times and the hospital 3 times they all told me the same thing i m perfectly healthy i m manifesting the symptoms due to my anxiety i have now registered with a new doctor and my first appointment was today i also went to the hospital 3 days ago my new doctor told me that with his patients he will read through their history but he likes to get to know them and judge from that the second i told him my symptoms he told me that my vitamin d is extremely low 17 and that i need to start the strongest tablets today he then did my blood pressure standing and sitting and told me i need to go straight to the hospital because of how low it is even though every time i ve been to the hospital and doctors they have not mentioned this once i obviously started freaking out but was relieved someone finally was listening luckily he was able to access my x ray from a few days ago and could see that my lungs and heart are working fine but was concerned about organ failure i need an urgent cortisol blood test and have had an urgent referral put through for a cardiologist and have been told if i faint i need to ring 999 straight away i know with anxiety especially health anxiety it s hard to know whether you are manifesting this physically or if there is actually something wrong but please if anyone is not 100 certain and you do not feel like yourself go to the doctor or go to the hospital and if they dismiss you change doctors this isn t to scare anybody as luckily this is really fixable with tablets but the fact this could have been solved 7 weeks ago rather than me get worse is crazy i will always advocate for myself now and will never settle for you re fine it s anxiety if i even have the slightest doubt that it isn t,generalized_anxiety
1pksmd5,you didn t waste that year i saw some posts about regretting wasting time being anxious and fearing that when you look back you ll realize you never truly lived during what should have been your best years my first thought reading it was: why do we always look back and blame the person who was already doing her best when we grow and reach a new level of understanding it s easy to feel disconnected from who we used to be but don t judge her that younger self that person was doing everything she could with the knowledge and tools she had at the time she was surviving i used to see the college entrance exam as more important than life itself back then everything around me family school society was telling me exactly that i didn t have the awareness to question it let alone push back now i understand because i ve grown i ve left my hometown seen more of the world read more watched more stories that moved me but i would never say to the girl who stayed up until 4 a m every night from anxiety who sometimes needed medication just to get through the day i would never tell her you were wasting your time instead i want to say: look how far i ve come from that place i am so much stronger than i knew and i m really proud of her proud of me we don t move forward by criticizing who we were we move forward by thanking her for enduring and by loving who we re becoming you didn t waste that year you were gathering strength you didn t even know you had,social_anxiety

1pkrg1n,fear of disappearing hi everyone i have anxiety and ocd and lately one specific intrusive fear has been bothering me a lot a while ago i watched a movie about dissociative identity disorder and after that i started worrying that i might have it too eventually i managed to calm myself down and let that thought go but then another intrusive idea came: what if my personality could just disappear and i would be left as an empty shell i also managed to dismiss that one but then a third thought showed up something like: what if i disappear completely what if in this multiverse version of reality i suddenly stop existing and since then i ve been stuck in this loop of: what if i disappear right now now now it gives me intense anxiety and even physical discomfort i know these thoughts don t make any logical sense but i can t find a way to fight them they feel so real even though i understand they re irrational i feel scared and confused and sometimes i worry that having these thoughts means i m going crazy has anyone experienced something similar how did you deal with it,generalized_anxiety

1pkqnvy,did the phrase put yourself in other peoples shoes ruin your life technically not phrased as a dae but too spiritually similar to be elsewhere so i hope that s fine this will also be highly anecdotal purely because i have no other way to put it i feel like i take this too literally funnily enough these feelings we re brought to light via a the onion title i saw on youtube about a girlfriend calling cold temperatures sweater weather while people die and it made me think: is this not exhausting for everyone else i m not sure when exactly i decided to take the phrase literally i believe it was somewhere in middle school when i d first started seeing social media content about certain things people do that make them mad and piss them off topped off with content regarding advocacy activism not speaking politically nowadays which i know is selfish to say it got debilitating for me to the point that i couldnt do anything with my life a how would you feel if you were ex: homeless turns into i will be homeless how will i prepare for being homeless i cannot prepare for being homeless i will likely die im dying right now im dying in a house fire someones coming to kill me you should really check that door what do you mean you can t get up you re gonna die why cant you move you re gonna die and this is the problem i feel bad for people and i dont feel their feelings i feel their danger and if i dont then i feel incredibly bad for not feeling it all the time because it means that i dont care something ive seen echoed by other people this is funny because there s no way that they dont turn it off with the way they act or the things they participate in it sucks because the main way to combat issues i feel strongly about for example homelessness is to help people firsthand it also involves regularly hearing and seeing horrible things and to be tapped into that all the time and i cant do it it brings me back to the catalyst the article the punchline in comparison to their other ones usual form of comedy seems to be that the escapism enjoyment of the mundane when other horrible things are happening is at fault instead of you know everything else dont they have to turn it off it only confirmed that i have to be in that headspace all the time always it s also gone into my personal life i feel as if i cant speak to my mother because she always has another horrible story or is watching some true crime documentary or something and i know its harmful but i cant say anything i feel as if i can t connect with people because as someone into heavier things i cant do shock value it makes me almost lose respect for people things which is funny because that makes them lose respect for me also even when i put that aside i cant watch horror movies for example with my friends because then all i can think of oh no thatd hurt i have an axe in my head im dying im dying turn this off why does nobody care people die all the time why does nobody care that people die all the time someone has surely died like this right surely they have to turn this off scratch that there has to be a way to turn this off right and if they dont why dont think think of people who think in extremes isnt that contradictory anyways ive been rambling for too long sorry if this is incomprehensible,social_anxiety
1pkqkqm,anyone else been so anxious for so long that you no longer feel your baseline anxiety level sometimes people will comment or respond to my physical symptoms of anxiety but i don t feel them emotionally because i m always in a state of heightened anxiety for me it feels normal if it weren t pointed out to me i d even say i was fine and genuinely mean it but that doesn t mean i m not affected by it my spouse calls it a superpower it s definitely not i m at the point where i think i need to try an ssri i m 37 and mostly have it under control due to years of practicing cbt techniques like redirected thinking meditation breathing exercises etc but i am tired of always being tired because i am always having to be vigilant about maintaining control i don t feel as panicked or messy as i did 10 yrs ago because i ve gotten so used to it but that doesn t make it less of an energy drain and i d just like a break,generalized_anxiety

1pkp8oy,my cat is literally the only mental health support i got some days and i m scared of losing her i know this might sound dramatic but i genuinely don t know how i d get through my worst anxiety days without my cat like there s something about her just existing in my space and purring next to me when i m spiraling at 2am that no amount of breathing exercises or grounding techniques can replicate you know the problem is i live in an apartment that technically doesn t allow pets and every single day i have this low level fear that someone s going to find out and i ll have to choose between my home and the one thing that actually keeps me somewhat stable it s like anxiety about my anxiety coping mechanism which is just peak irony i guess lol does anyone else deal with this the constant worry about losing access to the thing that helps you function i ve been looking into whether there s a legal way to protect having her here but honestly the whole process seems overwhelming when you re already barely keeping it together,generalized_anxiety

1pkolwb,i overcame debilitating public speaking anxiety and survived a 30 minute presentation i 27m have always had an irrational fear of public speaking presentations ever since i was in school i would go to extreme lengths of making up excuses faking sick to skip presentations or any form of public speaking this stemmed from early horrifying experiences of public speaking when i had no choice but to present i would find myself completely frozen my face would turn red lips would start quivering and my facial muscles would stiff up severely the worst this would even happen during social situations if i m caught off guard for a mini speech or if the spotlight was suddenly on me for presentations i wouldn t be able to look anyone and i d end up reading off slides with my back faced towards the audience funnily enough i was able to mostly work in remote roles early on in my career even when i had to go to office and present it would typically be in a low stakes catch up meeting with less than 10 people it wasn t nerve wrecking as i d present while seated with the rest of the team which made it feel less intimidating fast forward to this year i was asked to deliver a 2 minute demo in front of my entire company 100 ish during our townhall the first time they made me do it i got so nervous i made up a ridiculous excuse and got a colleague to cover i knew this wouldn t be sustainable so i prepared myself for the next couple of townhalls stumbled upon propranolol while researching on ways to combat anxiety and was able to pull through the presentations were very short just a couple of minutes and both times i had someone to present with i remember the first one going great because i addressed the crowd directly without feeling nervous the second time felt somewhat scary but i could still do it i took roughly 30 40mg of propranolol both times fast forward to recent events i was asked to present for 30 mins in a company wide event the moment i found out it completed killed me i ve never done this before i spent the next month leading up to the event debating whether to do it couldn t focus on anything it was all i ever thought about how on earth was i going to present for 30 minutes in front of so many people somehow i psyched myself to do it out of fear of being found out on the day of the event i considered strongly whether to still continue as my anxiety was debillitating however i felt it was too late to pull out as soon as i stepped into my office the fear paralysed me i was so so incredibly close to just walking straight back out and going home with an excuse of feeling unwell however i knew deep down avoidance would just grow this fear to the point of no potential return i should mention that i took 60mg of propranolol highest dose yet to get me through this yet it only helped with the physical symptoms so my mind was still racing somehow by god s grace i decided to just go up there when it was my turn to my surprise it went a whole lot better than i expected i absolutely killed it adding points which i didn t have during my practice runs making light jokes engaging with the audience it was as if the anxiety just dissipated within the first 30 seconds i m very certain propranolol helped because it s usually the physical symptoms that send my nerves to the extreme by the end of it i got a solid applause and compliments on my presentation skills everyone thought i was a natural which is insane considering i ve barely ever presented in my life in front of that many people if i could impart some key takeways from my experience it would be: 1 if i can do it so can you trust me my fear was irrational beyond belief 2 propranolol is a game changer my hr is usually in the 100s during these things it stabilised between 60 80 this time 3 practice practice practice this definitely made me feel confident in pushing through,social_anxiety

1pkl7za,anxiety about taking xanax got prescribed xanax for my anxiety frequent panic attacks yay i got prescribed 0 5mg and 30 of them a month i have general anxiety all the time but i m in therapy and really focusing on managing my anxiety through techniques other than meds if i m being honest though i ve been trying this for the last 10 years and i ve made a lot of progress ive definitely been able to calm myself down from a couple panic attacks i still panicked for a bit lol but i feel like i managed to calm down quicker with some doing breathing and grounding techniques anyway despite my best effort it s been too long of forcing myself to white knuckle through my anxiety thinking i just need to try harder and i ll be fixed one day ironically i m having anxiety about taking xanax i ve always had anxiety about taking any medication i had a traumatic experience as an infant where i had to be restrained to be worked on of course they fed me pain meds and all kinds of stuff because this was due to the tip of my finger being cut off i guess subconsciously this messed me up somehow so now i really struggle with taking any medications given the anxiety i already have around any medication on top of that i know all of the stigma around benzos and how they can be highly addictive i totally know i sound irrational but i have anxiety what can i say my mind tells me what if i become dependent what if i have a bad reaction is my anxiety even bad enough for this should i wait until my anxiety attack is severe before i take one i know i m not the only one with anxiety around taking benzos and i guess i m just looking for some advice and support for those that take any benzo do you take it regularly or only on your high anxiety days what is your personal threshold for when you know okay i need it now this is something i m working with my therapist on but i d love to hear from others who have had similar experiences with meds,panic_disorder

1pkknn3,acid reflux to start off please do not try and diagnose me my medical anxiety is extremely high and anything like that will spiral me i had bad acid reflux for about 2 weeks then had a awful panic attack after that i experienced constant anxiety for 4 days straight and on and off anxiety for the next 7 days up til now and i swear the main cause is acid reflux triggering the hell out of my anxiety it made me convinced that every food was going to cause an allergic reaction and i had to have cbt to eat without panicking it has caused me such bad health anxiety wondering if it s just anxiety and acid reflux which i ve always had health anxiety but never this bad the first 4 days straight i thought i was dying i ve been in the hospital like 5 times during all this and it s only been 11 days i know my bf is getting frustrated with all the hospital trips and this whole situation is stressing him out which also causes me to get stressed out even more i also had my social anxiety just disappear i literally want to talk to everyone and tell them how i feel i think because i just don t want to feel like this anymore but i don t know how to help it i have such bad anxiety taking medicine so i can t even convince myself to take an anti acid that i was prescribed my jaw stays so tight and i deal with such bad oxygen starvation the only way i haven t sent myself to the hospital everyday is i have one of the things that track your oxygen and heart rate everything makes me paranoid like my cat who doesn t really like anyone has been laying on my lap constantly and it s like she can probably sense that i m anxious and thats why but it just doesn t help knowing that i can t combat my anxiety with logical thoughts and it s difficult,panic_disorder

1pki49i,fear of being perceived how do i get over it i hope i word this in a way that is understandable so i can find some support guidance or even comfort knowing that someone else may struggle or has struggled with something similar i m 21 years old i m a female quite small 4 8 80 pounds this is important because it has bothered me most of my life i ve struggled with eating disorders since i was young i ve never felt my age i ve never felt comfortable in my own skin i struggle feeling like a grown woman i struggle finding beauty in myself i struggle with confidence presenting myself anything that is not cowering behind baggy clothes and keeping my presence small i can t stand when people look at me i can t stand being perceived this is very real and very damaging to my everyday life i m unsure whether or not my physical body is the full reason why i am this way or if it s things that have led up from my childhood up until now but i am constantly stuck in a state of dissociation i obsess about how i look and how i am presenting myself so often that i am never really in present time i m somewhere else somewhere in a future that doesn t exist a version of me that never will the version i could be in that very moment but instead of being i visualize it and dream about it instead of just being because i cannot let go i cannot be present it has ruined my life i ve never danced around anyone i ve never sung around anyone the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach i ve went to parties i ve went to the club i ve drank i ve smoked pot i ve taken molly i ve played my favorite songs loudly nothing makes me feel at ease enough to be myself because i am so caught up in both how i look doing whatever it is i should be doing and how right or wrong im doing it but im standing there like a deer in headlights feeing nauseous instead i have friends who love to sing and love to dance and with that have tried time and time again to make me dance with them gently easing me sometimes just telling me straight up to loosen up and move my body i can t i so badly wish i could but i can t i don t dance when im alone because i feel like im being watched even if im not i don t even really like to sing by myself if i catch myself doing it i grow embarrassed i would love to do these things but i just can t i get emotional because i genuinely feel stuck like i can t move my body i can t force myself to open my mouth to speak let alone sing car rides are awkward trying to have fun with friends or a potential boyfriend is awkward i will sing in my head and smile but even bopping my head feel impossible and embarrassing so i stay still while everyone else has a good time everyone knows me this way and they think im beyond strange and i don t blame them i hate myself for this i don t know where to start i don t know what to do to make myself feel comfortable i hate that everything feels embarrassing because i dont know how to do it right even if there is no right way especially when it comes to dancing to add on to sort of the same idea i don t drive either i am afraid of doing the wrong thing when it comes to being taught to being seen i avoided sports my entire childhood because i was afraid of failure afraid of embarrassment afraid of not being perfect first try afraid of being wrong i believe the same thing is happening when it comes to having fun with others and even by myself i get this same impending feeling of doom whenever im being taught to drive also i just want to cry the entire time many times i freeze up and cant move to make things easier on myself instead of facing it i say i dont know how and leave it at that i never try because why would i put myself in a position to possibly fail and embarrass myself i so desperately want to be able to at least try because when i don t i look like im not enjoying myself or in other situations like driving i just look lazy i don t know how to just feel good i don t know how to not think about what others are seeing or feeling i don t know how to not expect perfection i second guess the things i know how to do things ive known how to do for years i m never sure of myself even when i know something is true i can t stand that about myself this isn t only with dancing singing and driving it s everything i am at a complete loss i don t know where to start so i can gain confidence to conquer this very compact problem of mine i cry over this so much it s genuinely taken over my life i want to have fun and do these things i don t feel forced i don t feel like it isn t me i just feel stuck and embarrassed to the point that i would rather die than have fun because im unsure of myself :,social_anxiety

1pkbj4s,i finally admitted cannabis use to my psychiatrist as well as the doctor who performed a neuropsych eval have regrets it started when i went in for the neuropsych evaluation that my psychiatrist referred me to one of the first questions was about substance use and in the spur of the moment i figured screw it i ll finally say yes to cannabis my line of thought was that it would send a message that this guy is doing so poorly that he went and got a medical card to cope framing my anxiety issues for what they were so far neither of them seem to take issue with it likely because i did mention i had a medical card but now i m worried that i screwed up as a lot of medical professionals still see cannabis use in a very negative light the cannabis use is on my neuropsych report so now i m afraid of using it in the future as well it really sucks because i would like to be prescribed something more effective than what i m on and ideally discontinue cannabis for good but now i feel like my admitting to cannabis use will be a huge roadblock towards that,generalized_anxiety

1pk91fj,my pcp minimized my anxiety to my face and i can t stop replaying it i just need to vent because i m still upset about how dismissive my doctor was today i ve been on disability for severe anxiety and burnout since the beginning of november my therapist had originally referred me to a disability clinic for the state paperwork but they don t handle my employer s disability insurance since my pcp already knew everything i d been dealing with i thought going through her for the next part made sense she s the one who treated all the physical symptoms i didn t even realize were tied to anxiety when i kept having constant nausea and vomiting she referred me to gastroenterology gi found nothing when i broke out in stress hives and had a mild autoimmune marker she referred me to rheumatology they also found nothing she prescribed prednisone and hydroxyzine for the hives xanax when the anxiety turned into chest tightness and even buspirone earlier in the year because my depression anxiety screening scores were elevated she had every piece of evidence that things were getting worse i even called her office before scheduling to make sure she handles mental health disability paperwork they said yes if they had said no i would ve found somewhere else but the appointment was awful i came in with a full timeline because this didn t happen overnight and i didn t even get through the first part before she cut me off and basically told me to get a new job as if switching industries in your mid 30s after a 12 year career is easy as if i m mentally stable enough to job hunt as if the la job market is booming as if that magically fixes months of anxiety and physical symptoms then she said she can t do more because other people have real disabilities hearing that made me feel like she thought i was exaggerating or trying to avoid work even though she s the one who has been treating the vomiting hives chest pain insomnia and elevated anxiety scores for months my therapist recommended several months off because she believes i hit full burnout i wasn t asking for anything unreasonable i just needed documentation for what s actually been happening she did fill out the paperwork i needed but it was obvious she was reluctant and only signed off through the beginning of january because that was the maximum she was willing to do one month not what matched my symptoms just where she personally decided to stop it didn t feel supportive at all and the worst part is that instead of having time to rest or work on my mental health i ve spent most of this disability leave stressed out about paperwork approvals and whether i d even be believed the first part of my leave hasn t felt like healing it s felt like navigating a system that doesn t take mental health seriously i left feeling embarrassed invalidated and honestly hurt i know i m not faking anything but it still stings to be treated like you re not disabled enough especially by someone who has been treating the physical and mental fallout of this the entire year i m exhausted and i hate that asking for help made everything worse i just needed to get it out,social_anxiety

1pjyxvl,major anxiety and ocd from tarot card readings hello i am here because i am at a loss for words for how else i can help my anxiety for context i m single and i ve been looking for dates using dating apps for a while i was growing really frustrated with this and then came along an opportunity to have a tarot card reading on halloween i thought why not and so asked about love since i was struggling it was mostly an okay reading until there was a future part of it that mentioned the six of pentacles reverse and well my tarot reader said someone may try to take advantage of me for some reason this sparked a massive anxious streak in me and i decided to delete all my dating apps in fear that i was somehow manifesting a bad relationship i was also pretty gutted i really want to find a healthy relationship and this was not the news i wanted i suffer a lot with anxiety and i have some tarot cards at home i asked them frequently what kind of partner am i attracting and it would always point to cards such as the knight of swords reverse the magician reverse the high priestess reverse and i was gutted i cried about the cards thinking i was going to end up with some abusive person this played on my mind for weeks and i decided to lay the cards down i tried looking inwards and i found that yes you know what i do need to be more intuitive when picking a partner ive always ignored my gut feeling when in a relationship and perhaps i have rushed into things too quickly i felt good knowing this and spent the last 2 weeks resting and working on trusting myself again and when i wanted to start dating what boundaries i wanted to set flash forward to a few days ago and i felt a lot better i asked the cards am i ready to start dating again and postive results i got past: 4 of wands present: knight of cups future: 10 of cups with the bonus cards of reverse 3 of swords and the high priestess i was sooooo happy about this reading i thought my hard work was paying off until i asked what kind of partner i was attracting with my energy right now this is where i got confused i got: past: 7 of pentacles present: 9 of cups future: the moon it sounded promising at first but i had no idea what the moon meant and it really freaked me out i asked for more clarification to what this meant and i got past: 3 of swords reverse present: queen of pentacles future: 8 of cups reverse and then even more cards past: reverse 7 of cups present: reverse 8 of wands future: reverse magician i am so confused for bonus i asked the cards i am afraid of attracting the wrong person what shall i do and it answered: reverse page of pentacles queen of cups reverse 2 of swords well i ve been spiralling since then i couldn t get out of my head how the moon could mean deceit i had already gotten the reversed magician in previous readings and the revesed high preistess so in my spiral ive drawn more cards what is the moon trying to tell me further expansions on what kind of energy am i attracting past: reverse 3 of swords present: queen of pentacles future: 9 of cups reversed past: 7 of cups present: 8 of wands reversed future: magician reversed past: 3 of swords reversed present: the star reversed future: the chariot i got more obsessed about deciet and started asking the cards questions like am i in danger of a partner being dishonest with me i got: past: king of wands reversed present: queen of pentacles future king of swords past: the empress the present: the devil reversed the future: two of pentacles past: 9 of wands present 7 of pentacles future: the hanged man i also got cards such as past: 3 of cups reverse present: 10 of cups and future: 3 of pentacles past: 7 of swords 2 of pentacles reverse page of wands even more confusion so i pulled more how can i best protect my heart while moving forward past: 7 of swords present: 2 of pentacles future: page of wands 7 of swords panic and finally what is my next partner s intentions the fool reversed the seven of swords the tower my worst fears had been shown to me i cried on the spot ran to my mother and cried with her my mental health has spiralled into deep depression and major anxiety i am having panic attacks and crying all the time i ve told my mother to hide my tarot cards away so i dont pick them up again and have started seeing a therapist although they mentioend it could be months before they see me i am living in a state of fear that my next relationship is going to be deceitful and abusive and it breaks my heart because i want to find love good and honest and i feel like im trapped into meeting this horrible person with no escape no hope thats the future partner thats in store for me i suppose what i am asking is how do i get out of this cycle that impending doom is waiitng for me i m struggling to eat struggling to get on with my life because of what has happened how do i stop thinking that this type of relationship that is what is in store for me i can t bare to go through that anyone who knows tarot and is able to offer their perspective is grately appreicated or if there are any techniques or ways i can ease this overwhelming anxiety would be great

1pjy87k,antisocial stupid and inept: is there a future for me or am i doomed i just wish i had a stable income and could work doing the basics in peace but these days that simple desire seems unrealistic the paths currently advocated for improving one s life and income are: sucking up to superiors until maybe promoted: well i have a fundamental problem with that i don t like selling myself and i m certainly not socially capable of doing it effectively if i wanted to studying and specializing: it s not a guarantee of recognition because what seems to matter most is the social aspect and brown nosing but even if i took that path i m quite stupid my academic record is a disgrace i won t go far that way having an exceptional skill: well that s more a matter of luck and i don t have that i m incredibly mediocre at everything i do compared to the people who studied with me and the position i currently hold i was the worst in my class at what i do now i got the position through luck and deception i d say in short considering the limitations and resources i have at my disposal am i lost in this life doomed to misery and squalor,social_anxiety

1pjwnf1,this blew my mind: your gut reacts to stress way before your thoughts do something i noticed that changed how i see anxiety: my gut reacts to stress way faster and way louder than my actual thoughts it doesn t understand fear danger or what if thoughts it only understands: tension pressure breathing patterns how fast i m eating how safe or unsafe my body feels and when the gut freaks out it sends these intense signals upward that feel exactly like anxiety what confused me for years is that the body can create the anxiety feeling even when the mind is calm sometimes it s not: what am i anxious about but: what is my body trying to signal right now things like: not sleeping enough eating too fast holding tension in the diaphragm shallow breathing feeling rushed sitting in a weird position can create the same physical sensation as anxiety it s wild how the body can set the emotional tone before the brain even forms a thought this made me realize: sometimes the feeling comes first and the thoughts try to explain it afterward,generalized_anxiety

1pjv1zp,supporting someone with gad hi everyone my brother has gad diagnosed a couple years ago but he s been fighting with it for longer and in addition he might be on the autism spectrum my family pretty much all have this assumption but don t know if how to speak to him about it and he s most likely gifted he was tested as a kid and the only reason he didn t get the label was because his social intelligence score was lower everything else was pretty much through the roof so we have this really smart young man mid 30s who is struggling a lot and with most of that invisible to other people he does not have a ton of friends really just one good friend and he does tend to want to talk more when he s struggling so i usually interpret not hearing from him as a good sign but when i do hear from him it s almost certain that he s not feeling well his anxiety revolves around health concerns a lot but seems to be fuelled by other things like when his job is stressful when he hasn t been around people a lot when he s gone on a bad date i mean i guess that makes sense i feel worse in these situations too so i was wondering in general what would be helpful just listening reassurance rational picking apart of the fears he s fighting sharing own experiences with anxiety practical advice e g with relationship job stuff this is a point that troubles him a lot in intervals like sometimes he s like i m fine alone but other times you can tell it s doing a number on his self esteem that he s never been in a serious relationship and i think at this point he s kind of given up hope that it will happen,generalized_anxiety

1pjunvu,brain lags and physical numbness so i m making this post because i couldn t find posts about all those symptoms mixed together i d like to start with saying that it sucks so much that anxiety sympoms match so many symptoms of something more serious ane i haven t been to doctor s office with it yet though i have blood test tomorrow for me anxiety started 3 months ago when i was watching youtube on my pc and i randomly focused on my hand and i felt it go numb then i started checking my side forearm calf and it all felt numb i wanted to go to the er but i didn t after calming down as i saw it stopped when i calmed down i then had other anxiety symptoms for few days and then it stopped completely until it started appearing while i was working i left my job to recover from it on it s own because it caused me to sleep really bad after a month it went away again for few days and then it came back till now i feel like it actually got alot worse in the last few days especially at night when i was just chilling as usual and i felt my body go numb again though i didn t have balance problems or dizzines on top of that i felt like air was escaping my lungs somewhere for 20 seconds and derealization got alot worse like my brain wasn t processing what i was seeing on top of having a weird deja vu a minute before i was really tempted again to go to the er but i didn t it was 2 days ago on top of that i now started feeling like that all day long unlike before only at night when i m going somewhere i would just often get confused when i go the wrong direction or not remember what i did or said 5 seconds ago alot of times even when my heartbeat is normal it gets alot worse at night when i m going to bed and close my eyes for 10 seconds i would start answering to vivid images that pop up like for example if my brain imagined a person asking a random question i would answer it out loud or move my hand or something tonight i woke up in the middle of the night confused af i thought i couldn t speak and move though i could on top of the physical numbness that came back few days ago when i even slightly focus on my limb or whole body it even kinda hurts a bit like phantom pain i would just move my hand and feel like it s actually a cm away from it and the numbness as if you were to keep your hand in cold for a bit and it s numb but whole body you can move no problem and you don t feel the cold i can t tell which is worse the numbness detachment like being only 40 there feeling or other symptoms like fear of forgetting how to breathe feeling like you re about to faint fearing that you might choke on food weakened taste buds or just anxiety while relaxing has anybody here experienced similar symptoms combined and fully recovered,panic_disorder

1pjucve,medication hi all i have been diagnosed with anxiety and emotional dysregulation i m 26 f and have been going to therapy since i was 20 but found my current therapist 2 years ago she has been fantastic and i have learnt and improved alot in the last 2 years something that i still struggle with is overthinking paranoia and anxiety especially in social situations i avoid doing stuff because i feel so nauseas and anxious it has been so emotionally exhausting i have had a very stressful last few months which has gotten worse recently and since then my anxiety has been through the roof i am really trying to get my shit together next year and trying to be the best version of myself but i feel like my anxiety and everything is holding me back it s like no matter how much i try and push through it it doesn t go away i try to regulate myself and i manage to do so but it spikes back up not long after it is hard for me to regulate myself when i m at work because i can t just sit alone at work and do what i har to do i have had to take some time off study because i just have no motivation i am so incredibly tired and i either struggle to sleep because my brain won t shut up or it s broken my psychologist has recommended me medication july last year she believes that s going on a small dosage for a small amount of time while in therapy and creating good habits and building myself would really benefit me at the time my ex said no and talked me out of it which is why i hadn t since i have been feeling so incredibly shit recently and it s effecting my day to day i have been thinking about speaking to my gp about doing what my psychologist suggested but after doing research i m not certain it sounds absolutely great to be able to stabilise my emotions so i can put the work in on myself without the extra shit but i have heard so many horror stories about the withdrawals and not feeling the same after and wishing they could go back to how they were and that terrifies me i will speak to my doctor about it but what is your experience with mediation and withdrawals if you have been through them,social_anxiety

1pjtnb9,stuck in retail i m currently stuck in a dead end retail job and as someone with severe social anxiety it is extremely stressful every interaction with a customer has me coming away from it thinking that the other person hates me or is annoyed by me because of some social mishap i made or the fact that i m just a generally awkward person and with christmas coming up the number of customers is becoming too much for me to handle the store has been flooded with customers lately and it s hard to actually focus on doing my job when i m surrounded by all these people any of whom could potentially stop me and ask me for something which can quickly stress me out my doctor prescribed me buspirone for the anxiety but it hasn t helped much or i haven t noticed any effects at the very least these anxiety issues cause me to be extremely drained at the end of the day thinking over all the awkward stuff i said or did that probably annoyed someone or pissed someone off whether customer or coworker and combined with my depression it means that my ability to look for a new job is very limited i do the bare minimum looking for jobs and i find nothing and i don t improve myself or work on my skills either because i genuinely can t be bothered depression or laziness maybe both anyway not sure why i m posting this maybe just to get it out there to vent maybe if someone has advice that d be nice but i m not hopeful i ve gotten little great advice in the past whether through counselling or online support i just feel hopeless about my ability to change my situation i need a new job certainly but i can t manage to get one and in the meantime i m just getting by day by day overly anxious in a job that seems tailor made to target my childhood fears of having to talk to people a fear that has persisted into adulthood and has made me dread going into work every single day tl dr: working in retail as someone with severe social anxiety is draining me leaving me combined with my depression unable to find a new job i feel hopeless like i can t do anything at all to change my situation,social_anxiety

1pjofur,finally recovering from years of panic disorder and somatic ocd : hello everyone its been 3 years now that i ve been suffering from a panic disorder and somatic ocd and i guess i really wanted to get this out and finally be able to express myself and what i went thru and hope that my post can help others suffering from this combination feel less alone and hopeful about their future and share my progress with you all as im very proud of what i have achieved for the past 6 months but i have no one to share it with i m 23 and most of my life i have always been fairly normal except for my social anxiety as a teenager which i guess started all of this unconsciously ive never thought once in my life that it would get this bad and id be dealing with this hell of a disorder 3 years ago is when everything started one day i started noticing my breathing and i couldn t stop noticing it which lead me to start breathing manually at first it was fine as i thought it would go away on its own but it never did and i found myself breathing manually for 70 of the day i couldn t sleep and i couldn t talk to people at all which made me thought i would be like this for the rest of my life i would never be able to breathe automatically again this experience lead me to develop the panic disorder everytime i was breathing manually so many about 15k times a day i would panic cause i thought this would never end and i broke myself and in the span of 6 months it became so deeply ingrained that it essentially became a pattern after 6 month the manual breathing went away as in 2022 chatgpt came along and i was finally able to get a tool where it could give me direct advice and understand it and it gave me solid advice to just not fight it and let it happen and it worked but the panic stayed as my brain made it a new baseline to panic every time i breathed like conditioning and i was experiencing a panic attack about every 10 minutes or so and everytime i breathed every day for the next 2 years it was horrible i think a lot of people here knows how it feels like so i don t really have to describe it but it was hell nothing worked to stop it 6 months ago i finally started seeking therapy for it and my therapist recommended me act and exposure therapy where you accept the feelings and let it happen and expose your brain to it until it becomes desensitized to it on its own and it has finally been able to break me out of this hell i fought so hard every day to expose myself to the panic to different triggers and now although i still have it i am able to function normally despite the panic attacks being here from times to times and im able to make it background noise and know that nothing will happen to me its so freeing to finally get myself back my freedom and being able to do things knowing it cant hurt me i saw a huge reduction in the frequency of when it happens from like every 10 minutes to every 4 5 hours or so and when it happens now it subsides quickly like after 30 seconds or a minute i only get peaks now and it goes away im very proud of myself from what ive accomplished and i keep looking forward to my future and finding my peace and i hope that anyone else suffering from this does too just know there is a light at the end of it and i hope you all find your light its hard but we are incredibly strong its a horrible disorder and yet we are still here and still fighting we are genuinely very strong and this strength will be a sort of gift once healed : i wish you all the best in your journey to find this peace,panic_disorder
1pjo4td,palpitations pvcs ruining me i don t even know where to start i feel like pvcs have been controlling my life for months now and i m honestly exhausted i ve always been a little prone to health anxiety but it was never debilitating until this whole pvc mess started it s like the second i felt that first weird thump in my chest everything in my life got divided into before and after for most of my life i never really thought about my heartbeat i knew anxiety could make me feel off sometimes but i never paid attention to the physical stuff too much then one night completely out of nowhere i felt this huge thud in my chest like my heart literally flipped over it scared the hell out of me i sat up immediately convinced something terrible was happening but then nothing else happened until it did more random thumps then quiet then another one i barely slept that night because i was just lying there waiting for the next one after that it was like my brain locked onto my heartbeat 24 7 i couldn t stop scanning myself every little flutter or pause sent me spiraling i tried to talk myself down at first telling myself it was just anxiety but i d never felt anything like that before so of course my mind automatically jumped to the worst case scenario i finally went to the doctor totally prepared to hear something terrifying they did an ekg which of course came back normal because my heart always behaves perfectly when someone else is looking at it eventually they sent me for a holter monitor i wore the stupid thing for 24 48 hours felt like i was hyper aware of every beat while it was attached and when the results came back they said it showed some pvcs and pacs but still under the concerning range apparently benign love that word benign it should ve made me feel better but it honestly didn t all i could think was: if they re so benign why do they feel so awful why do they feel like my heart is tripping over itself i cut out caffeine completely which was its own nightmare i cut out alcohol i drank more water than any human should i tried breathing exercises stretching sleeping earlier everything sometimes the pvcs went away for days which gave me false hope and then boom one random night i d get a cluster of them and be right back at square one it s like my body waits until i finally relax and then throws one in just to keep me unstable the worst part is that when i m doing something fun or distracting i barely feel them at all which tells me anxiety is definitely feeding the fire but the second i m quiet or trying to sleep or even just sitting still my whole brain zooms in on my chest is that a flutter was that a skipped beat am i about to go into some deadly arrhythmia it s honestly pathetic how much time i spend just thinking about my heart i used to worry about normal life stuff now i worry about whether one rogue heartbeat is going to kill me i know logically pvcs are common i know tons of people have them and don t even notice i know my tests were fine and my doctor wasn t concerned but it feels like i can t escape this loop i m tired of constantly checking my pulse i m tired of bracing myself for the next thump i m tired of being scared to lie down at night because that s when they hit the hardest i feel like my entire personality has been replaced with someone who just obsesses over their heart rhythm all day i guess i m just venting because i don t know what else to do i don t want pvcs to take over my life but right now it feels like they already have if anyone else has dealt with this or gotten through it i would genuinely love to hear how because i m starting to forget what normal even feels like,panic_disorder

1pjm4z0,anxiety hangover in full effect on saturday night i started to not feel super great and went to bed wearing my fitbit and before falling asleep saw my pulse was at 110 lying down proceeded to sleep about an hour before waking up panicked and seeing my pulse over 110 again that kicked off 5 hours of me being unable to sleep for the rest of the night and just laying in bed panicking and not feeling well attempted to get up and go to work and felt ok after a shower and for the first half hour but when i tried to eat my breakfast just felt sick was constantly either too hot and sweating or too cold and freezing eventually decided after 2 hours at work to go home and rest after getting home i check my blood pressure to see it at 145 100 and checked my blood sugar i am diabetic to find it at 250 that lead me to driving myself to the er after some blood tests being hooked to a ecg and blood pressure monitor that showed me at 160 115 and a full bag of saline drip got told it was likely just a stomach bug and to go rest it off but realized after they released me they never did blood tests to rule out clots and started to panic i was having a heart attack ended up going to my moms and having a good cry and felt much better and was able to sleep that night although tossing and turning pretty regularly decided to call in the next day to rest and relax and got an hour walk in and was feeling a lot better a more restful sleep later and i went to work the next day and made it through about 75 of the day before feelings of anxiety came back got off work went for another walk and then took a shower before bed where i took 40mg of cbd gummies and a 3mg melatonin gummy felt alright and went to bed only to wake up freaking out again this time no nausea but just a heart burn like pain in my chest and joint soreness in my shoulders and elbows ended up staying awake for 4 hours before i was able to get a little more sleep in and go to work where after 75 of the day we went to a company bowling event before i showed up to work was able to meditate and stop the nerves in my body from being on end but still felt plenty of anxiety throughout the day and random chest tightness heartburn feelings as well as pain in between my shoulder blades now i m at home sitting on a heating pack on my back and trying to calm down thankfully i don t work tomorrow but just feel so tired done with this feeling that something is wrong even though i know that if i were having any kind of cardiac emergency it would ve been more pronounced and more of an issue either on my walks or while bowling with my co workers i guess i just wanted to vent but if anyone has tips for things i can do to not be so on edge or even just to help someone know they re not alone in their feelings right now we will get through this and feel better i know it,panic_disorder

1pjlw5m,nuropod actually seems to have helped so about 4 months ago i decided to talk with dr gpt about anxiety and see if it had any suggestions i hadn t already thought of it actually mentioned one that i had messed with in different ways but never this directly vagus nerve stimulation i had tried various forms of vns in terms of breathing exercises meditation even stimulating the dive response by putting a cold mask on which is supposed to stimulate the vegas nerve however none of them every really seemed to make a big dent i found several vegas nerve stimulators online however the nurood it s pricey came with the most research behind it what you do is attach a little clip to your left ear and it delivers tiny electric shocks it feels like a slight pulsing i do it for 20 minutes in the morning while doing breathing exercises and then 30 minutes at night while watching tv in bed from what i have read you don t want to overdo it as it can cause overstimulation that way however i can say that it certainly seems to have helped my anxiety spikes don t seem to be as debilitating as they were i recently did something that used to cause me huge anxiety walk instead of drive to the supermarket so i didn t have a quick escape and while i felt some anxiety it wasn t the usual 9 10 i would get which is what led me to just drive instead even though it is only a mile away this is not a cure by any means and it is expensive 900 but it does seem to have helped so i wanted to share just google nuropod and you will find it,social_anxiety

1pjkqyw,is this only anxiety i ve struggled with anxiety for as long as i can remember but lately it s been getting much worse i always have this sense of dread that i m going to make the wrong decision and therefore get in trouble i feel like that sounds a bit childish but that s the best way to describe it i make decisions and immediately feel anxious guilty that i made the wrong choice even in simple conversations i worry that what i said could come across as rude and i either hurt the other person or seem like a mean person when it was something that the other person realistically didn t catch or care about how i said it even with people that i know are my friends i constantly worry that i m going to say or do something bad and instead of them simply letting me know that i said something a little weird or rude they re going to just immediately drop me from their lives which i know isnt true and isnt fair to them because they re such kind loving people and also makes me feel worse for thinking that way i m exhausted of constantly scrutinizing every action i do or every thing i say but no matter how aware i am that it s truly not that serious and me slipping up every once in a while doesn t make me a bad person i can t help it i do plan to try and get therapy for this but until then i feel so lost and was wondering if anyone else has gotten past this,generalized_anxiety

1pjigr8,just admitted to myself that i have food anxiety what now i 26f have been struggling with i guess you could call it disordered eating or food anxiety i never had an eating disorder per se but for as long as i can remember i ve had anxiety about food when i was born i was premature by 2 months and have always had issues with eating my mom even said that whenever she was breastfeeding or bottlefeeding she would have to feed me in increments because i would always throw up i never really had a big appetite and as i got a little older there was a period of time where my father wouldn t let me leave the dinner table until i ate all of my food which would cause me to get sick again ever since then i would have frequent occurrences where i could be starving but as soon as there s food in front of me i would get nauseous and can t eat there would be instances where i would be at a restaurant with my family and as soon as the food comes out i get nauseous try to take small bites then start gagging and have to go outside it could be triggered by even the sight and smell of food it has definitely gotten better now that i m an adult but i still experience this food anxiety in certain situations for example this past thanksgiving i started getting anxious when it was dinner time it was a sit down dinner not like previous years where everyone kind of grazed throughout the night no tv no music just everyone at the table eating i m prescribed an anxiety med that i take for emergencies which definitely helped with the anxiety symptoms sweating deep breathing etc but i still had no appetite and would get nauseous whenever i tried to put food in my mouth it isn t until later when i m calm that my appetite comes back and i can eat everything in sight my mom thinks that it s a subconscious trauma response to my dad force feeding me since i ve never explored it until now i don t know what form of therapy or what kind of specialized doctor would be able to help me with this it s very embarrassing and something i m upset i can t control any advice is very much appreciated,social_anxiety

1pjhyab,20 m need some advice for anxiety in the first week of october i developed a gut infection after several painful episodes of diarrhea which was followed by a bladder infection and a uti over the following weeks this sequence of illnesses triggered muscle spasms nerve tingling burning numbness abdominal and groin pain debilitating fatigue and significant stress i had never experienced that level of pain all at the same time ever in my life i was prescribed levofloxacin for the uti along with a few other medications and vitamin supplement to manage the gi symptoms during this period i became extremely stressed and hyper focused on my symptoms constantly looking up diseases and catastrophizing worrying that this might become a lifelong condition by early november the accumulation of symptoms and fear caused my stress levels to escalate even further and i was only sleeping about two hours each night although the primary infection symptoms have now subsided i m still dealing with lingering issues: nerve tingling headaches often accompanied by a heavy feeling in my head fatigue shortness of breath rapid shallow breathing frequent yawning and muscle aches in my neck shoulders and back since early november i ve also had a persistent dry burning sensation in my eyes for which i m using eye drops it feels like my body is stuck in a constant fight or flight or freeze mode my doctor believes this is generalized anxiety disorder gad and suggested both cbt and an ssri been to 1 session of cbt don t think it was too useful because i couldn t attribute what my anxiety trigger was will continue cbt though all of this is very new to me i ve been through stressful situations before but i ve never experienced anything like this even caffeine makes my physical symptoms significantly worse so i ve had to stop it which has been a huge bummer most days now i feel mentally calm but physically pained and exhausted its not like a thought is triggering physical symptoms of anxiety its more like these symptoms are always there throughout the day right now i ve started doing yoga meditation and trying to improve my diet just wanted some advice from anyone who has dealt with something similar especially regarding medication as thats something i would preferably want to avoid sorry if this is too long,generalized_anxiety
1pjhtb2,i found out its easy er to talk to and meet new people at a boulderroom boulderhall there are indoor boulderhalls and climbinghalls i do both but its much easier starting a conversation in the boulderhall i have noticed in the boulderhall: there you just try your route and then rest while resting you just look around dont stare well its obvious p and sometimes at people if you feel like it sometimes its not so rare a good opportunity arises when you can say a little sentence like when someone tries the same route and is better: oh i will need a long time to can do it or is worse: ah this route is particulary hard do as if you are struggling make your weak so he she isnt sad or intimidated or if you search a girl or a boy a mate lmao: just climb and fail stay sitting then look around look at people and into their eyes thats important and see if you notice someone who notices your views and looks back either he she comes to you or you need to come to he if you are unsure just go away some distance and if he she comes back after minutes he she is maybe probably interested well not uninterested anyway also if you have a friend or siste take them with you other people are more open and relaxed when they meet the same sexed people i didnt find anyone in the climbing hall because i find its harder to start a conversation there you hold your partner with the rope there and its always a 2 people group and more serious more concentration maybe this helps some :,social_anxiety

1pjh2bq,advice on anxiety freeze response i have this chronic freeze thing where my brain shuts down very easily physically and mentally whenever i try to do anything like thinking speaking tasks hobbies etc i don t feel the panic my body jumps straight into freezing but i m also hyper vigilant at the exact same time i notice everything and everyone around me i notice how their energy and moods drop and it signals danger which makes it worse and then if i try to force myself out of being frozen i start spiralling crying and hyperventilating etc or sometimes this just comes after being frozen too which then leads into autistic shutdown it feels different to my normal anxiety because i don t feel any warnings at all it s like someone slamming on the brakes and i jump headfirst into freeze with no warning before i feel a drop of the worrying feeling anxious and scared i feel like i m constantly like 60 70 frozen and only like 30 of me is actually doing what i m supposed to do but i also experience chronic brain fog i m not sure if that s also related my freezing or if that s its own thing it s very weird i m not sure if i m even describing it correctly so i m sorry i m autistic so putting things into words and sentences is also difficult for me i have tried cognitive behavioural therapy but it doesn t help at all because there s no thoughts to challenge when the freeze hits i ve tried grounding but honestly grounding exercises only make me angry grounding helps if i m having a panic attack where i m hyperventilating or having spiralling thoughts but it really does not touch the freeze it feels like anything i do to unfreeze my brain just triggers me again and i m extremely exhausted from it any advice would be greatly appreciated and knowing if there s others that experience this would also help me not catastrophise my experience because so far i ve only learnt i m not worthy of help because the help does not help at all everything i ve tried so far as had no positive outcomes,generalized_anxiety

1pjex5b,i m worried about my teen developing psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia a little background i have a raging anxiety disorder it s been on and off total for about 10 years i ve been doing well up until the last year when i found my husband was having an affair the disorder came back full swing reintroducing my fear of schizophrenia i ve worked through this particular fear before as i used to worry that my anxiety symptoms would lead me into full blown schizo land after a lot of work i seemed to be doing alot better with it when it came to myself i have two children one 14 the other 6 both have been treated for anxiety my 14 year old however is having a hard time with life right now he resents his father for cheating on me and to be honest the last year has been hell for all of us he also has a hard time in school he has great grades keeps them up but he gets so stressed about it he also has a history of being bullied picked on on top of all that he broke up with his girlfriend a couple of months ago and she has been stalking harassing and asking others to bully him online this all brings me to my concern a few months ago my 14 year old told me he was having hallucinations he knew the things he was seeing weren t actually real so he was able to distinguish the difference he explained that he would see something blink and it would go away he had 3 4 hallucinations over the course of 4 days he was sick possibly with mono the week prior i do mental health checks with my children weekly just to see how they are doing he said he has not had any hallucinations since last night when doing our weekly check in he asked if he could skip school i asked him why and he said because no one at school likes him he s getting picked on again and says people talk about him he told me he feels weird when he s in school and the best way to describe it was lonely i tried to dig deeper but he had a really hard time explaining exactly what he was feeling so my question is do we think this is all just anxiety normal teen development topped with lots of stress factors or is my child in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia i ve got myself so worked up about it it has literally been making me sick,generalized_anxiety

1pjdtqv,propranolol might be a life saver i just wanted to share my experience because i was hesitant to start any drug i started therapy and met with a psychiatrist this week for my driving and flying anxiety the anxiety is so bad like almost immediately and automatically a panic attack when getting on the freeway the psychiatrist gave me 10 mg propranolol and today was my first time trying it after an hour i could not feel any inkling of anxiety so i decided to see what would happen if i hopped on the freeway my brain still had some fear but not feeling any of the physical symptoms almost immediately changed the way i view driving i wondered why i ever felt scared most of my anxiety stems from the physical sensations and i think my brain learned to fear things based on what my body tells it so i think the propranolol will help to train my brain to not be scared of these things on top of therapy emdr i think this might be the golden ticket,panic_disorder

1pja5q5,is it harmful for me to love plushie so much hello i m here for longer venting and a question most of this will probably sound extra weird and crazy so please but i thought it was relevant to the question it s just a few words about trauma and then question i ve currently had baby fever for 5 months straight i think maybe it s got better or maybe not i m not sure i just got really attached to this little cute plushie puppy i took him as my own baby we keep cuddling and he s just so sweet i can t explain my feelings when i m holding him he s like my own literal baby nameless though i don t even know where he s from and how old is he but i ve had him most of my life i thought he helped me with my 5 month lasting baby fever a little but now i m thinking the opposite kinda he s making me so calm and i m so excited to see him after a day even though he s always with me i m always so overjoyed with him i want to cry last time i have severe anxiety and stress and with him i feel so peaceful and quiet inside and so warm he s just so sweet and adorable i wish you could see him alive he also has my scent i didn t put anything on him but i cuddle with him so much he smells sweet on his muzzle because i m nuzzling him and rubbing cheeks so much but i feel also so so overprotective like he s mine with me is safe but also he doesn t hurt me i feel panicked and have intense distress without him when i m cuddling him everything feels so gentle and soothing but in a second dark thoughts start and i can t turn them off and suddenly i feel sadness and fear of losing him i m extremely worried i ll lose him somewhere it already happened to me once with a white tiger plushie when i was little i have adhd so also i m bringing him everywhere with me he s always in the inner pocket of my jacket or in my bag but i feel bad for him because it s probably uncomfortable even though he s a plushie i would totally break if i lost him i ll fall apart he s making me feel so safe but not in the same time because of the fear of loss i would collapse if i lost him i carry him everywhere out of fear and feel panicky at the idea of separation i feel responsible for his comfort and safety i feel responsible for protecting him the idea of him being home alone is destroying me and making me so anxious for 18 years of my life i heard from my father to be careful with everything to lock the door twice so we wouldn t get robbed to turn off all electronics from the sockets when i leave so they wouldn t start a fire but repeatedly he was also angry and yelling be careful be careful it s nice but combined with the traumas he gave me and everything i m just paranoid also ocd adhd and my therapist suspects autism and bpd or bipolar disorder it s just overwhelming and exhausting and i ll still have to look for a psychiatrist because the therapist said it was the best idea i don t mind checking things to see if they re okay but he was check again don t trust something bad could happen i feel like if i relax something will go wrong like if i lose control disaster happens i ve also been in alert in the last few months it s called hyperviglance i m not sure just when i imagine not being careful for once not checking not guarding not anticipating disaster i get so massively scared also if i lost him i ll be like losing a child literally his my baby the fear of losing him feel so intense that it makes my chest tight i m panicky and the feeling is so unbearable i can t even stop touching him i feel like some force will pull him out of my hands i m literally curled around him most of the time when i m alone i m worried that if i let go something terrible happens father was also always saying and repeating that we re being watched doesn t matter how just watched and eavesdropped front mobile cameras computers pcs cameras satellites ufos that in the night they re watching you for 18 years warning for further text please i don t want sound crazy but about an hour ago i felt really really bad and threatened i had to stand up and walked to the window opening it and watching outside if there s something or nothing i was looking at the sky mostly because i felt like if a spaceship is there judging allowed that they re there i have bird seeds on the windowsill i took some and threw them up in the direction where i felt someone was watching me father always said that advanced alien technology has the ability to make their spaceships invisible like that scene in avp 04 in the end i feel threatened and my puppy is twice as much at risk he s small and vulnerable i feel like the danger is everywhere i was taught that invisible forces exist i feel like a safety is impossible also from trauma but that would be too long writing and that the vigilance is necessary i m alone in my dorm room rn with my puppy i don t want to be schizophrenic i don t want to so bad but i heard father s bullshit for 18 years and i was 20 in november and we live without him only for 2 years it s so hard to just stop to think like this i don t actually know how schizophrenia works but the idea scares me and back to my puppy i m keeping him safe now my puppy i feel like being his mother keep him safe because something may take him i must protect him or everything falls apart i love him too much so much as my own so maybe the question finally is it harmful for me to love plushie so much to get attached to him so bad like what will be with him if i d e,panic_disorder

1pnoeq5,anyone able to offer reassurance hi guys its 2 am and i just took my emergency medication im currently extremely scared of having another panic episode because i only recovered from the last one a few weeks ago i just need some outside reassurance that this is a singular event and that it doesnt mean everything will go to shit i started taking clonazepam on the 25 of october after being in a constant panic state for 6 months aside from two 2 week intermissions inbetween it was incredibly effective and i hadn t had any panic attacks since and stopped taking it after 4 5 weeks continuing without panic attacks the past 7 days i have slept horribly pulling two all nighters and only getting one night with more than 4 hours of sleep i ve suffered from insomnia for a very long time and i take medication but sometimes it just be like that i know though that not getting enough sleep always causes panic and then i sleep even less because i m scared and then i panic more i thought it would be okay this time because i had been doing well for a few weeks and then suddenly it appeared again it was more the constant fear in the background sending me into fight or flight that things would get bad again but today i had a micro panic attack again and i cant shake the feeling that the panic has come to fuck me over again rationally i know now that medication can fix it but i just really really dont want to go through it again for the 4th episode of the year especially not at christmas anyways sorry for typing so much i just needed to get these thoughts out of my brain hope you are all doing well,panic_disorder
1pno8oa,throat sensations omg i hate hate hate my new symptom globus sensation i think all symptoms are the worst when you re actively going through them but i feel like this one takes the cake for me i basically live at the er with how much i go and i always get the same result anxiety note: this was for different symptoms i ve never gotten my throat checked it s so hard to just trust my own history they were all false alarms but what if this time it s actually something what if i just allowed myself to get too comfortable with feeling uncomfortable it feels like hell because my throat has never been affected in this way before i basically get a weird feeling like a very mild feeling of impending doom and suddenly it feels as though my throat s been sprayed yk minus the taste like the sensation of the spray hitting ur throat then i start to feel like someone s hand is pressing down on my throat and when i try to swallow i feel congested yet no mucus and when i try to talk it feels like something is about to come up not vomit more like a tonsil stone or stuck food but nothing ever does and nothing is there that i know of it s so many different sensations i pretty quickly start dissociating and tremoring i even get the feeling of a raw throat as if i ve been crying or yelling despite doing neither of the two it s just so odd and i don t know how to not think it s something else i actually developed panic disorder from untreated health anxiety so this is very triggering any advice would help i currently have no useful meds nobody will perscribe me anything except hydroxyzine so i really can t just take meds and be okay and someone said massaging their throat provides almost instant relief but that flat out won t work for me despite it working for every single person who commented on that thread i saw so uhhh verry anxiety inducing lmao the choking sensation been present for about 4 days but i started feeling like i have excessive mucus for about 3 weeks of course no real congestion though i don t have true trouble swallowing nor do i have any lumps or difficulty breathing which is assuring but ya know i still fear for the worst haha that s pretty much it,panic_disorder

1pnihyc,anyone else fear the panic hangover more than the attack hi 20f here just wondering if anyone else out there also fears what comes after the panic more than the actual panic attack itself for me personally i know i can push through a panic attack and while it s scary i know i can deal with it what really terrifies me is what happens after i panic which is usually a long spiral that lasts hours to even days on how i m never going to get better stuck like this etc if anyone has any advice for that part of panic that would really help the anxiety and rumination that comes after the attack is way worse for me than the attack itself i also have ocd which probably contributes but just seeing if there s anyone else out there like this if so and you ve found some tips or tricks please let me know thanks,panic_disorder

1pj0ea7,how to find support hey guys i have panic disorder the panic attacks where i start shaking uncontrollably can t move can t breathe hyperventilation hands and feet clamp up etc usually i take a 25 or klonopin and can feel better within an hour at least the shaking and muscle spasms subside however i normally know when they re coming and can stop them in their tracks the problem i m having and having tonight at 3am is when i m violently awakened by a full blown one it s the most excruciating feeling and very hard to come out of by myself even after taking the medication the dread is overwhelming and i become desperate for any type of human contact i desperately knock on my housemates doors sometimes and if i m luckily someone will be up to just be with me which makes me feel some sort of support and less alone tonight was not one of those nights and i m struggling i m close to ubering to the hospital just to be with a human does anyone have any advice for when there s no one to help or just be there for you dos anyone else get that feeling like they just need someone to be there as if i know i m going to die and want to make sure someone knows or can call an ambulance i think it has something to do with my separation anxiety as well sometimes my panic attacks fade down if i have a friend or my mom with me but lately i don t have that option and the panic attacks have become physically debilitating to the point where i can t even talk i m in therapy twice a week and i ve had panic since i was a kid i m feeling hopeless and alone especially because none of my friends or anyone close to me has had a panic attack nearly as bad and physical as mine so i don t relate to anyone it feels like i m the only one going through the severe physical symptoms i ve been judged before with my panic attacks things like this again or you need to relax and meditate and i know it s also not fair for my friends to have to deal with this and my panic attacks at 3am it s a lot so i m just wondering how can i move forward with this alone,panic_disorder

1pitquw,finally healing from my panic disorder and somatic ocd : hello everyone its been 3 years now that i ve been suffering from a panic disorder and somatic ocd and i guess i really wanted to get this out and finally be able to express myself and what i went thru and hope that my post can help others suffering from this combination feel less alone and hopeful about their future and share my progress with you all as im very proud of what i have achieved for the past 6 months but i have no one to share it with i m 23 and most of my life i have always been fairly normal except for my social anxiety as a teenager which i guess started all of this unconsciously ive never thought once in my life that it would get this bad and id be dealing with this hell of a disorder 3 years ago is when everything started one day i started noticing my breathing and i couldn t stop noticing it which lead me to start breathing manually at first it was fine as i thought it would go away on its own but it never did and i found myself breathing manually for 70 of the day i couldn t sleep and i couldn t talk to people at all which made me thought i would be like this for the rest of my life i would never be able to breathe automatically again this experience lead me to develop the panic disorder everytime i was breathing manually so many about 15k times a day i would panic cause i thought this would never end and i broke myself and in the span of 6 months it became so deeply ingrained that it essentially became a pattern after 6 month the manual breathing went away as in 2022 chatgpt came along and i was finally able to get a tool where it could give me direct advice and understand it and it gave me solid advice to just not fight it and let it happen and it worked but the panic stayed as my brain made it a new baseline to panic every time i breathed like conditioning and i was experiencing a panic attack about every 10 minutes or so and everytime i breathed every day for the next 2 years it was horrible i think everyone here knows how it feels like so i don t really have to describe it but it was hell nothing worked to stop it 6 months ago i finally started seeking therapy for it and my therapist recommended me act and exposure therapy where you accept the feelings and let it happen and expose your brain to it until it becomes desensitized to it on its own and it has finally been able to break me out of this hell i fought so hard every day to expose myself to the panic to different triggers and now although i still have it i am able to function normally despite the panic attacks being here from times to times and im able to make it background noise and know that nothing will happen to me its so freeing to finally get myself back my freedom and being able to do things knowing it cant hurt me i saw a huge reduction in the frequency of when it happens from like every 10 minutes to every 4 5 hours or so and when it happens now it subsides quickly like after 30 seconds or a minute i only get peaks now and it goes away im very proud of myself from what ive accomplished and i keep looking forward to my future and finding my peace and i hope that anyone else suffering from this does too just know there is a light at the end of it and i hope you all find your light its hard but we are incredibly strong its a horrible disorder and yet we are still here and still fighting we are genuinely very strong and this strength will be a sort of gift once healed : i wish you all the best in your journey,panic_disorder

1pgai91,adhd autism masking as panic disorder i m 30f and have had anxiety panic attacks since i was a child i have been reflecting a lot on how i ve had treatment resistant panic and anxiety for the majority of my life i ve been considering whether i have been neurodivergent this entire time and my lived experience has just been a constant battle of feeling overstimulated overwhelmed and no one really understanding why i have all of the symptoms of adhd i fidget constantly struggle with focus have extreme rejection sensitivity struggle to learn didactically and have poor working memory i do however have very fast processing speed and verbal comprehension and have intense hyperfixations so i m academic and am also risk averse so i was never the naughty kid getting bad grades at school like other children with adhd issues my parents used shame as a motivator for behaviour change and so i ve mostly just used fear and shame as my mechanism for helping me push through my school work and leveraging on hyperfixations this obviously has made my life look functional but i have explosions of panic attacks that occur every 12 months on average i think i may have just been labelled as anxious and that became a vicious cycle making my panic attacks worse because i ve been trying to treat them via a neurotypical framework only and now i just have this intense issue with shame and feeling different has anyone else got the same or a similar journey,panic_disorder

1pb0phx,panic attacks gone off dairy reintro brought them back hi there i just wanted to share my story since i was a toddler i had anxiety panic issues i d beg my mom to wait outside my room until i fell asleep not because of paranormal reasons just because i had genuine unknown fear and her being there wouldn t give me comfort but it would at the same time and i ve dealt with adhd symptoms on top of my panic attacks and also a weird feeling of stabbing pins and needles in my tongue which would cause me to tear up my whole life i ve had ups and downs of me freaking out when it s night time acne which worsened panic and living on a farm for a lot of my childhood adolescence didn t help with all of it essentially without getting into grave detail i started working out at 16 i m 23 now and began to get self conscious about how i looked and my main initial motivation for working out was to make myself attractive enough so that i might have a future chance with the girl who just rejected me that motivation lingered but my main goal switched to just being healthy and strong i changed my diet a lot and i d occasionally notice that my anxiety would drop to almost 0 two instances were: 1 i went meat only for a month i felt euphoric by day 28 2 i switched to plant based protein powder my confidence and clarity skyrocketed recently i fasted for a week and then ate like 1 2tbsp of goat cheese and i had a near instant tongue stabbing episode and i was terrified that my tongue was going to swell up and had like a day long panic attack too so i cut out all amounts of dairy along with gluten chicken and chicken eggs about 30 days ago and i made changes to my diet so that i get a ton of water and high electrolytes of the main three sodium potassium magnesium and i take a lot of d3 and i get roughly 111g of protein without going crazy on calories btw for the last three months i ve been completely housebound because the last three times i tried to drive i had massive panic attacks it s been insane my focus is starting to creep back my panic and forgetfulness adhd symptoms are dropping and exactly 7 days ago i tried reintroducing dairy again as an experiment to isolate variable and within 1 hour i had a panic attack that made me feel like i couldn t escape and i felt numb in the head and my nighttime freakouts came back for the next 4 5 days now that the dairy symptoms are manageable enough to feel kind of like myself i wanted to write this in case anyone noticed they would feel panic flare ups after eating sometimes that might be the issue and i used to smoke a lot of weed at 17 20 and when i was 20 i fasted for a month then ate a cheesesteak sandwich and then smoked a joint and had the worst panic attack of my life basically i m linking my panic symptoms to diet because i want to smoke weed again and have it feel good like it used to and with almost 100 certainty found the answe for my panic symptoms i m getting blood ige testing soon to confirm but the elimination re challenge results are already undeniable,panic_disorder

1pa5bwc,this is what a panic relapse feels like right now i m in a bad panic flare right now it s another pad relapse i ve had these cycles for 20 years and i m now 42 years old lately my baseline is anxiety with daily panic attacks layered on top of it some of the attacks are manageable and minor nuisances i can ground myself while experiencing them some take over my mind and whole body so intensely that i recently called 911 i ve had years in the past when panic attack disorder lets up and gets less heavy it usually takes intense regimens of cbt to accomplish this it does work for months a few times a year this time it came back and has really stayed i ve not been able to shake it i ve had some very big life changes recently my relationship ended and we started co parenting for our 3 year old so i ve recently moved out and started rebuilding i received a promotion at work which is great and what i wanted but the reality of the position is not at all in line with what i did to get there none of this is too much for me by itself but as a whole my nervous system hasn t kept up with all the changes one thing that s been hard to admit is how complicated help becomes when i unconsciously begin relying on it my safety behaviors are turning into crutches support from loved ones and hotlines is slowly turning into total dependence my interoception is through the roof what was healthy awareness has turned into hypervigilant monitoring data from wearables has become obsession i have so many great tools designed to keep me safe and should be reassuring but they have begun to quietly convince me that my body is in danger everywhere the anticipation is so much to bear my body is always waiting for something that never quite arrives there is one sentence i try to consider and come back to throughout the day: this is discomfort not danger i m grateful though because i m fortunate that between episodes i have no depression or hopelessness i love my life and all that it has to offer it s in these attacks that i can t see straight so right now what i m holding onto is the difference between what s happening in my body and who i actually am i know this is happening to me not who i am,panic_disorder

1p8o3j8,advice for existential panic and dread a couple years ago i developed panic disorder and it was existentialism that was the most terrifying for me i got so stuck in trying to figure out all those big terrifying questions that felt even scarier whilst in that state of panic if that is where you re at drowning in the overwhelming fear and dread then you need to take a step back there is no thinking you way through it when you re stuck in the fear from experience the best thing you can do is connect connect with anything nature or a friend express yourself move your body the spiral gets so intense when it remains so purely in your mind and it s not to say distract yourself and never think about existentialism again but you need to approach it with a calm nervous system so rather than trying to answer an unanswerable question get out of your brain and try to interact with the world till it feels less scary to approach i promise that it all feels so much less terrifying when your body can calm all my love from an internet stranger with a chaos brain,panic_disorder

1p7e0rp,can t stop panicking and i need advice so i have pretty bad panic disorder and agoraphobia i ll leave my house but only to go to certain safe places i did a favor for a friend who doesn t have an ebay account and i sold a video game console for him i should have just marked it as non hazardous when i printed the label but it had lithium ion batteries in it so i did the right thing and chose the package contained hazardous materials and chose lithium ion batteries from the drop down the label printed out and said hazardous and can go ground only so i thought cool i did it right usps picked up the package from my house and 2 hours later the call me and say i need to come down there and put a hazardous sticker on the side of the box denoting which hazard is in there i looked it up and found the sticker i need to use the problem is i can t stop panicking and freaking out one because i regret not just shipping it out and choosing non hazardous and this would be a non issue and two because the thought of going to the post office and waiting in line and then having to explain why i m there etc has sent me into a panic and i m spiraling and can t stop replaying the scenario in my head and my heart is racing etc i called them and asked id they could please just return the package to my house and i would eat the cost of the shipping label print a new one and put the proper stickers on it but they are refusing saying they can t handle the package and i need to pick it up which sent me into another panic attack if this was just a 50 item i would just say screw it and tell them to throw it away and eat the 50 but it was a 400 sale for my friend it just sucks that something so simple as going 1 5 miles to the post office and getting in line and taking 1 min to explain why i m there and slapping a sticker on the side of the box is such a daunting and impossible task for me i feel like such a loser and i don t know how i m going to get down there and do it without shaking and my heart racing at 160 and feeling like i m gonna pass out i feel so defeated and now i m just ruminating about the whole situation and why didn t i just ship it out like i have with other electronics and not choose hazardous materials ugh,panic_disorder

1p5960s,my kid got me sick and i apparently have reactive asthma i am not doing well i m getting flashes of feelings i had like back when i still use to smoke bud or when i had bad ptsd from an ex and was in shock for months my breathing seems to be doing better but it was all triggered a few days ago i did not understand why when i would get up to use the rest room i would get so anxious and on brink of a huge panic attack pulse that normally was at 74 was resting at 100 117 on my propranolol i attempted to go to work and my manager sent me home so i decided to go to the walk in to get a note to excuse my absence i am stressed about missing work and figured whatever i can do to help not panic and feel like i m letting anyone down he said my lungs sounded awful and i m dealing with athsma i was super confused i have had exercise induced asthma growing up but never heard of reactive asthma he wanted me on prednisone and that made me panic more at this point i was getting the sweats and was feeling trapped i explained to him that last time i took it it was not good for me i had a high heart rate kept getting panic attacks and almost had to go to the er due to my blood pressure being stupid high and was hot and sweaty he then said we ll your asthma is really bad sounding agitated bedside manner is not his strong suit it seems as any doc should know asthma makes people panic already and i have panic disorder on top of it anyways i told him i would be diligent on using my inhaler even if it raises my pulse so i would feel better and he said if it gets worse to go to the er my oxygen has been doing well 96 and above i ve been taking mucinex for chest congestion trying to drink a lot and added water to my cpap machine to help with moisture to help break everything up i ve had multiple showers putting breathe easy essential oil in the corners and doing controlled coughing to help move stuff out but i am still getting huge waves of panic mainly at night since everyone is asleep i get up and i feel so out of it the feeling that i got when i would smoke long ago that made me stop comes up it s like i m getting swung one direction but not really dizzy i don t know how better to explain it it sucks because i am a mother i have a 6 yr old i feel like i should have my ish figured out by my age but a little cold can just set me off to be fair last time i was sick was in july and my kid had gotten covid from daycare and i was not doing well mentally then either and was quite scared so i think it is just kind of all snowballing i m on zoloft highest dose for depression and anxiety as far as i know idk what else to do other than therapy which finding a good therapist who takes my insurance has been hell i also just lost my last parent and just had sent my half sister what i want the headstone to look like and what to be written on it and i am assuming it is effecting me more than i realize makes sense timing wise and i have been so sensitive past few days idk what exactly i am looking for other than maybe someone saying hey me too i get it and knowing this is normal for our amazing lizard brains at least writing this out has helped somewhat for me holding it in and not expressing it and trying to act normal makes it worse also another reason why i say my fears outlook to like my coworker i will be like i feel not okay today so if i stop breathing or something call an ambulance lol like duh of course they would but luckily they get it as their wife deals with panic attacks pretty badly too and he has as well but just saying it out there kinda is like cool i m safe if you made it this far thank you you re a rockstar and i truly hope you are doing well,panic_disorder

1p2os7d,beta blockers for physical symptoms hi everyone quick disclosure before i start: my doctor has already reassured me about this medication but if you struggle with health anxiety you know how hard it can be to trust reassurance and try something new i deal with intense physical anxiety symptoms racing heart shaking headaches but only when i have to leave the house at home i feel totally fine my doctor prescribed me propranolol 10mg to help calm those physical symptoms here s where my anxiety gets in the way: if i m at home and not having any symptoms i m too afraid to take it because i worry it could slow my heart down too much since it s already normal but if i m about to go out and i am having symptoms i m scared to take it then too because the idea of trying a new medication while already panicking and being away from home hospital access makes me fear i ll have side effects and spiral even more i ve been reassured multiple times that 10mg is a very low dose and won t do anything dangerous to my heart but the fear still takes over so i m wondering: has anyone taken propranolol before having physical anxiety symptoms just to see how their body reacts first or is it something you should really only take when those symptoms kick in and your heart is racing any insight or personal experience would mean a lot,generalized_anxiety

1p1qjvy,panic attacks can feel like a heart attack i went to the er last month because one night i had sharp pain in my chest and it freaked me out more on why later so my heart was racing and when i went they couldn t find anything immediately wrong and sent me home however something more intense happened last night i was pretty sedentary during the day didn t feel wonderful because my period is about to start so i was taking it slow it was around 8 pm and i just gotten back home from getting a fruit bowl i sat down on the couch noticing some sharp chest pain but i didn t think much of it and figured i just needed to chill out we were gonna watch something on tv so i got up to go get my glasses from my bedroom and the chest pain got a little worse and i was feeling dizzy i could feel my heart racing for apparently no reason so i sat back down and figured i needed to just not move for a little bit but it wasn t going away i used a blood pressure monitor to check my blood pressure was elevated a little and my heart rate was 125 while trying to be as calm as possible i deemed i should go to the er because i don t have family medical history and i had a brother die at 25 i m 24f non smoker no drinking etc from a heart attack and my father just died at 66 from a heart attack but my dad was a heavy drinker and smoker so maybe that had something to do with it anyways on the way to the er the pain starts getting worse sharp stabbing left side above breast spasming and i m freaking out because i think this is it i m gonna die it s also burning like icy hot on the inside i get to the er and they take blood and do an x ray and say they can t find anything immediately wrong they also gave me valium for anxiety and yet before they even gave me that i had started to calm down and my heart rate and blood pressure were back to normal they discharged me and told me to follow up with a primary and maybe see a cardiologist so i made an appointment as soon as i could for primary which is this friday at 7 am but i don t know what to make of it and i m a little worried about waiting that long to see the doctor and then have to get a referral and wait and see a cardiologist i m kind of just posting here to see if anybody s been through anything similar and has any sort of comforting words to advise me or if there s a better option i m guessing if the pain comes back i ll just go back to the er but i ve been laying in bed all day today scared to get up and my chest has felt sore on the left side i do obviously struggle with anxiety but this felt different and was extremely scary it s now wednesday and my left side chest is still a little sore and the center of my chest feels heavy it s been hard to sleep because of the worry of what s next,panic_disorder

1oxhl54,feeling worse after diagnosis hi all i was recently diagnosed with panic disorder about 2 weeks ago by my psychiatrist and ever since then have been having panic attacks daily where it was about 3 or 4 times a week prior to this i think im just so scared and aware of having panic disorder that it s making me panic even more did anyone else deal with this and did anything help does it eventually get better with time,panic_disorder
1oxdcaj,is this really panic or something else hi all i wanted to come on here after being a lurker for a long time to seek out some validation i know i have had panic disorder with dpdr my entire life on and off some periods of time are good and stable and others are really difficult i am currently in a hellish period where every aspect of my life is suffering due to the cycle it started over the summer when i began having a lot of weird dpdr issues it was extremely distressing to me because it felt like i wasn t real like i was not the one looking through my own eyes trying to explain that to people made it extra hard i had panic attacks on and off during it but the main issue was just the weirdness from dpdr and the obsessiveness over it i was actually really successful in being able to work through that though i did a lot of things in the last few months i never thought i would be able to do while having those feelings unfortunately due to a medication taper i got triggered into a really intense panic cycle and my mind is making me believe it is something more nefarious than just panic i feel absolutely unable to sit with people and hold a conversation i can t fully describe the feelings to the extent i want to but it feels like mainly i am losing control of my bodily functions i feel like i am either going to pass out have a seizure or explode it feels like my body is wrong i feel like i am jumping out of my skin because of the wrongness things around be don t feel right or how they should be and i have this never ending impending doom that i am about to lose my shit it s like this agitation that comes deep inside of me and makes functioning impossible the only thing that keeps me semi calm is just lying down and being on my phone which ends up making me feel worse i know reading this back it does sound like panic but there is something inside me saying that it s something different but i don t know what else it would be i need to know if any of you have ever felt this way because i don t get traditional panic attack symptoms where i am short of breath and my chest is tight it just feels like i am outside my body and something is wrong but i have no idea how to describe it then my head feels a big pressure inside it and i feel off kilter and dizzy the thought of having to sit in one place is way too much to handle during it i have a prescription for xanax but i am terrified to take it because if i take it and it doesn t make me feel better i feel like i will be hopeless i just started prozac yesterday so i am hoping it helps i sometimes take a 10 mg of propranolol but it makes my head feel weird af like i am disconnected from my head and body any comments of validation would be helpful i don t quite know what i am looking for i just feel alone and freak ish and sad,panic_disorder
1oxc5mp,prn medication if anyone gets the kind of panic attacks where it feels like you can t breathe and the symptoms are mostly physical like tight breathing or air hunger what medication do you take to calm it down does hydroxyzine work for those kinds of symptoms i m just asking so i know what to bring up with my psychiatrist if anyone can help i d very much appreciate it,panic_disorder
1ox59ex,anxiety and medication i ve been doing some research and i think i have an idea of how to recover from this anxiety is supposedly the fight or flight response of our nervous system and the only way to overcome it is to expose yourself to and accept the symptoms okay i understand that but right now i feel exhausted and i was advised to start medication the problem is that i want to heal from the root cause not just get rid of the symptoms is there any way to take medication just to stabilize myself and continue with exposure therapy basically using medication but experiencing the symptoms as a 5 10 instead of a 10 10,social_anxiety
1ox3p32,do your panic attacks feel this bad i used to have really physical panic attacks my heart rate would shoot over 190 bpm verified and i also have svt sometimes but this was sinus tach i take 120mg propranolol a day now plus 1mg klonopin and the meds have honestly changed my life i m stable i work two jobs i m a wife and mom i travel i function like a normal person usually but because the meds block the physical symptoms my panic attacks feel totally different now i don t get the racing heart or shaking anymore which is great but now they come on as this weird sudden wave of dread that s honestly harder to identify in the moment it feels like: this random something is very wrong feeling like i want to crawl out of my skin the world feels surreal dark or unsafe i get this intense discomfort where i wish i could just sleep it off or disappear for a minute like i m about to die but without the obvious physical signs strong urge to reach out to others for help texting or calling friends family i had one yesterday lasted about 30 minutes and then i literally just went on with my day and even went to work afterward so clearly they do end but in the moment it feels impossible to believe that how do you convince yourself it s just a panic attack when the symptoms are more mental than physical now what do your panic attacks feel like i tried being curious this time and imagined i was a human being studied by doctors or aliens lol trying to understand emotions weirdly it helped the most helpful thing was just realizing it did pass eventually i d rather experience pretty much anything else because the worst part is that you don t know you re going to be okay i have a high tolerance for uncomfortable experiences but these get me everytime,panic_disorder
1owkadm,six months since my last panic attack i realized today that it has been six months since my last panic attack so i wanted to celebrate and offer encouragement to anyone who feels like the panic cycle will never rest i had my first panic attack at 32 m and for the better part of the next year fought off relentless anxiety and panic attacks to say it was one of the hardest seasons of my life would be an understatement between therapy loved ones support books podcasts and online resources i became of student of my panic and anxiety i learned a lot about what triggers me what coping mechanisms work well for me and forced myself to let panic and anxiety co exist with me as you all know co existing is the hardest part when everything in your mind and body tells you you re in danger i know i m not cured and i don t have a magic cure for others either i suspect i ll have panic attacks in the future and i still have moments and stretches of days where anxiety is humming in the background too my panic and anxiety often prompt shame spiraling and my inner critic is loud so i m taking a moment to choose gratitude and celebrate how far i ve come instead,panic_disorder
1owfppy,new and sudden anxiety possibly a bit vent ish but i m mostly hoping people can relate and share advice if they have any background: almost 3 weeks ago i had a really bad panic attack and went to the er i think being on effexor for a few days then stopping bc it wasnt right for me could have contributed plus i had at least 300 400mg of caffeine that day usually doesnt bother me but still i ve only had 2 other ones in my life and it was just me being light headed and fainting for a few seconds so this was pretty horrifying i felt like i couldnt breathe and my heart chest and stomach was painfully tight and i was tingly and having tremors everywhere and my fingers were all bent and stiff they gave me hydroxyzine which helped then i continued to take it for a few days but stopped because it made my heart and anxiety feel worse since then i ve been constantly on edge and still have increased heart rate and chest pain discomfort just the other day i had half a monster and it got worse i dont drink caffeine all the time but when i do i can handle much more than that now i m too scared to have like a starbucks i ve been unable to enjoy life cuz of depression and now i m unable to enjoy life cuz of anxiety this feels so sudden i don t want to be stuck with it or have to treat a whole other problem i m hoping its just medication effects so i can get back to focusing on depression is this the start of a lifetime of anxiety,panic_disorder
1ow7v8t,panic disorder and non stimulating adhd medication tldr if you dont wanna read allat i have panic disorder that is mostly dealt with realized i have what is likely executive functioning issue interested in trying non stimulating adhd meds have a pyschiatrist appointment today but looking for personal experiences or thoughts for people with panic disorder who have tried atomoxetine strattera guanfacine intuniv or bupropion wellbutrin im especially interested here because it seems to address my issues the most but also is mildly stimulating wondering how much it will effect panic please read the rest of the post for background and specific symptoms hi guys i have a psychiatrist appointment today and im not looking for medical advice but wondering if yall have any personal experience with the issues or medication im talking about here so i can get an idea of what peoples experiences where i don t post here much except some comments because ive been mostly treated for pd quick background around 4 years ago i started having panic attacks largely because i was smoking weed alot and the stimulation and heartrate increase was making me freak out etc even after i stopped i had severe anxiety about my heart and thought i was dying all the time typical panic attack stuff psychiatrist prescribed 75 mg zoloft about 3 4 months later i felt mostly better couple years after that i thought i could be without zoloft because i didnt have panic attacks anymore and i thought it was giving me brain fog and dissociation etc 3 months later panic attacks again metal clarity and brain fog never fixed went back on 25mg zoloft feel fine now i guess i only need a smaller dose now after all the healing and therapy and stuff i ve done everything with panic disorder at this point is pretty much fine besides extra anxiety during certain events like plane flights of which i have benzos prescribed all of that was background real questions start here so for pretty much my whole life i ve always performed bad in school bad grades never motivated to study procrastination etc as a kid i remember taking some sort of adhd test and being negative my parents said that the explanation we got from the psychiatrist was that i didn t technically have adhd but i had anxiety and ocd that kind of presented like adhd my parents always wanted me to get on some sort of adhd medication but i always pushed back because i guess i thought it was like special help and i wanted to be able to perform without it like other kids could fast forward to college still having all of those issues but after the whole panic attack thing i had lots of really bad dissociation depersonalization derealization etc over time it became less of dissociative episodes and not feeling real and more of just like a persistent fog where i never really feel present or cognitive like i used to before panic over the past couple weeks i ve realized that i ve probably been in denial about my productivity focus issues i ve been doing bad enough in college and taking longer to graduate than i should and i cant keep doing that i always just thought i was lazy or bad at getting stuff done but after talking with a really close friend who does have diagnosed adhd and has been helped hugely by medication i started realizing the things i ve dealt with aren t really normal: 1 : motivation and making the right decisions there are tons of times when i know i should be doing homework studying etc and i want to and plan to but like i just can t like i literally can t make myself similarly every new semester i always tell myself im gonna fix this and that or do things differently but when it comes to actually making those changes i just don t and its not because i dont want to its like theres a disconnect between me wanting and planning to and actually doing it 2 : focus i do have diagnosed ocd and this is probably huge here i feel like i can t stay focused on one thing or when i can focus on 1 thing its not what i should be working n i either get distracted by compulsions or by short term goals or by thing that are easier or more fun getting distracted or wanting to do easier or more fun things as opposed to hard work can be something that anyone deals with but for me it feels unrelated to how disciplined i am or how hard i try or care and just how it is 3 : brain fog and mental clarity all the time i feel some sort of dissociation or brain fog it almost feels like my mind is out of focus like a camera or eyes would be but like not optically just how my mind feels i feel like i m in a fog all the time i have a super visual mind and can imagine objects in scenarios well but when i try to visually organize all the things i need to do and work it just all fogs together in a mess i feel like im not present or clear at all in my mind and it sucks now i always thought that with panic disorder i couldnt take adhd medications because the stimulation would just make me freak out right away which is probably true with normal stimulants but i recently decided to look into non simulating versions from my understanding the options are: 1 atomoxetine strattera : non stimulating helps with motivation and focus norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor improves executive functioning signal 2 guanfacine intuniv : alpha 2 agonist originally a blood pressure medication now fda approved for adhd helps your brain differentiate between the main goal and distractions reduces noisy neural firing filters out distractions has a calming effect due to lower blood pressure so is almost the opposite of stimulating 3 bupropion wellbutrin : this is actually something my psychiatrist recommended a year or two ago when i was dealing with binge eating issues my understanding is that it also increases the executive functioning signal directly improves motivation and energy i ve even heard it can feel like that brain fog is lifting off of you also understand that it helps initiate tasks and improve impulse control this sounds amazing for my issues but i also understand that it s mildly stimulating which scared me cus i dont want to trigger panic i suppose i could take a xanax ive been prescribed as needed if it starts to make me panic but still scares me this is the one im most curious from yall about anyways im just wondering for yall that either have adhd or functioning issues along with panic disorder how did you deal with it did u take any of these medication or others how did it effect panic,panic_disorder
1ow7ukj,hair pulling i m having panic attacks all the time multiple times a week for hours and i end up ripping my hair out and i m losing a lot of hair an i m just wondering if there s any thing else i could possibly do during panic attack the pain seems to distract me a little bit but i don t like losing my hair,panic_disorder
1ow5d7e,please read: been in an episode for about a week my panic attacks can sometimes last this long but it is very rare and i am pretty much at a loss right now as to how to move forward i am traveling quite a bit for work and it has triggered me hardcore shakes cold sweats racing thoughts i have no appetite i throw up every morning i can sip tea which is good i am supposed to leave on a big international trip to brazil tomorrow morning and all the dread and all of the panic is so intense that i have just been numbing myself like crazy my therapist is working overtime trying to find a solution diazepam suppositories and anti nausea medication i so badly just wanted to stop i want it to go away i just want some relief the only thing that helps is xanax i could spend my days in a fog but i m going to run out i can t just take them every single day for an indefinite amount of time i don t meet a lot of people that know what it s like to have multi day panic i get panic attacks usually once a year and traditionally they re between 2 to 5 days i can t seem to snap out of this one because the trip is coming up there is a scenario where i don t go but then there s a shame associated with that and whether that would actually help my panic or not i ve been thinking about getting iv today since i m still in the states i m worried that any medication is a stronger than the xanax is just gonna make me dizzy nothing is helping me with my racing thoughts and my shaking and my nausea of course the natural doom and gloom is to go to me being fired ending up on disability losing my house being homeless dying i can t pull back right now i ve been in this position before and read other peoples positions and i ve always been wanting to help them focus on the step not the staircase please please give me any words to encouragement or help i am cold and i am sick,panic_disorder

1ovh39h,i smoked weed once and triggered panic attacks i used weed once and had a panic attack i recovered the next day but a few days later i had another one and this kept happening for about 6 months at first i kept going to the er thinking something was wrong with my heart i did several ecgs blood tests even a 24 hour holter monitor but all results came back normal when i get a panic attack i usually feel pain in the lower left side of my chest numbness in my left arm jaw and back sometimes it changes like my hands or back go numb instead the panic always seems to come out of nowhere building up in waves my psychiatrist prescribed me secita 5mg an antidepressant it seemed to help at first but near the end of the treatment the panic attacks got worse again it honestly didn t feel like it helped much so i don t really want to take medication anymore also years ago i had a similar experience panic attacks that lasted for a month or two but that time it wasn t triggered by weed and wasn t as intense as this one they eventually went away on their own back then now i m stuck wondering should i go back to a cardiologist just to be sure or is this all just panic related i m not sure what to do anymore at this point i can t even do functional workouts or live my life actively like i used to i m a developer and i can t do my work properly because of constant brain fog i can t remember basic things can t focus it s really starting to take over everything edit: i haven t used weed since i had a panic attack,panic_disorder

1ouoc82,tms for panic depression hello my psychiatrist had just approved me today for a referral to get transcranial magnetic stimulation or tms for short has anyone else tried tms for panic or depression i guess for a tiny amount of context i ve gone through many ssri s and my psychiatrist is not all that confident that an snri will work for me due to the severe reactions i ve had to medication my gene site test shows that most of the medication s are in the red section for me so it means i m more at risk for adverse reactions to almost everything they said they ve never seen a genesite test like mine before but it makes sense because i ve had awful reactions to everything so far i ve heard and seen overwhelmingly positive results around this procedure tms but i m still scared because back in the day my great grandmother had electro shock therapy for postpartum depression and it changed her personality for the worse and then it made her life really hard because no one wanted to be around her it makes me sad for her now i know tms is an entirely different procedure than electro shock therapy and it s so much more less invasive but i m still scared sincerely a permanently nervous guy,panic_disorder

1oseizd,panic attacks evolved into sadness attacks anyone else hi there thanks for this sub i ve been lurking for a while but haven t participated out of fear that discussing my pa would trigger them thanks everyone for your discourse it s helped me feel less alone onto my question: after a decade of panic attacks i finally sought cbt for it after a year with my therapist they ve evolved into sadness attacks anyone else have this they used to always have a panic attack or multiple and then a deep sorrow that would usually break me down and i d have to find somewhere to cry pull over while driving etc now the panic attacks have become milder but the sadness starts instantly tw: my panic attacks manifest from a deep fear of dying i ve gone through bouts of xenophobia but have come out from it previously also with help of a therapist i didn t seek help specifically for the panic attacks until last year and i didn t realize how bad they were for me until my therapist had me log them and i d have upwards of 19 per week and as few as 7 we discovered the patterns around when where and how they happen and i started to avoid situations at first then confront them and mitigate and now i no longer have to use mitigation techniques and in an instant i m devastated to tears still about anything death related age time space history ancestry heritage existentialism existential history etc sorry to ramble i m scared about what they ll evolve to next like what is their final pokemon form and will i be able to not cry all the time,panic_disorder
1ose16t,need help understanding this sentence on this website there is a section titled how is panic disorder diagnosed in this section the answer is: your healthcare provider or a mental health professional may diagnose you with panic disorder based on your symptoms generally if you have 4 or more panic attacks and if you are in constant fear of having another you have panic disorder four per what amount of time i have been considering that i may have panic disorder and i have about four a month on average but does it mean four a week four a month four a year or what i would like to make it clear i am not diagnosing myself based on this website or trusting it completely i am just looking to get a general idea,panic_disorder

1onsnml,silent panic attack relief hi everyone i m not new to panic attacks but i am new to the silent part of panic or at least what i ve been made aware of i ve never struggled with too many physical symptoms of panic except some finger tingling and shortness of breath having said when my panic comes along it attacks my mind like a wave that cannot be stopped i feel like i m honestly going to lose it and either go into psychosis or go crazy for lack of a better term now this actually has never happened and i only wish my brain believed it but then i spend the remaining time after in fear it s going to happen again which it rarely does while the panic is scary it s line the aftermath is worse i spend almost every waking minute in fear and worrying about the next i know that they can t hurt me the panic that is i know they don t last forever but i cannot get my brain to believe this does anyone have any recommendations on how to combat this in way maybe i haven t thought of i m in therapy i m on an antidepressant maybe i should look to change it and i have clonazepam and propranolol in case of dire need and i really hate having to rely on either of these it s a lonely feeling it s scary just looking for some support if nothing else much love,panic_disorder

1omn80t,my story about panic attacks fear and autonomic disorder hi everyone i want to share my story about how panic attacks and autonomic disorder started how it went and what i did the rules of this community do not allow talking about complete recovery so i will simply say a fact 11 years have passed and panic attacks have not returned disclaimer: everything described is only my personal experience my story i do not teach anyone how to do things right and i do not encourage anyone to repeat my methods the description of what i felt may seem a bit harsh but i believe it is right to tell the true sensations i had at that time so winter of 2014 at that time my main hobby was photographing birds and animals in parks in the wild everywhere one weekend as usual i took my camera and went for a walk it was a really cold day 27degc so the walk was to the nearest park not far from home i was lucky on leftover mountain ash berries i found many birds thrushes and waxwings the shooting fascinated me i spent about 2 hours there until the batteries in the camera froze of course i was also frozen but the mood was great i was happy about a successful day there were about 20 minutes of walking home and i headed back and that s where the thing started that then blew my mind for several months on the way i felt dizziness pretty strong later calmly analyzing what happened it became obvious to me that this was the result of emotional and physical exhaustion from impressions and long exposure to cold but then then i really got scared i still didn t know about panic attacks autonomic disorders and all that my first reaction was strong fear that i damaged something in the cold that i could lose consciousness right now and simply die in the snow the fear and panic were completely irrational i was walking through the city around were people cars houses shops cafes even if i actually collapsed most likely someone would help me but fear and panic pierced through completely i remember biting my tongue until it bled to cause real pain and come to myself a little and i almost ran home and panic only grew thoughts were climbing into my head what if you froze vessels in your head and now a stroke will happen when i reached home at first it seemed everything returned to normal i warmed up calmed down ate and drank hot tea marked this episode as strange and went to rest in the evening i sorted fresh photos as usual and enjoyed good shots everything was normal until i needed to go outside again the next day the familiar fear and panic returned immediately after the door closed i was still going down the stairs but everything already returned outside it became even worse the whole set of symptoms fell like a snowball dizziness feeling of losing consciousness the strongest fear to die right now from from anything from a stroke heart rupture loss of consciousness and unlucky fall it was absolute animal terror i had no idea what to do with it i had never faced something like this before sports trekking long difficult workouts were normal for me and here i simply could not do anything fears and panic continued multiplying i was already afraid even at home to make extra physical movement strain myself with house chores anything relief came only from the position freeze and do not strain then maybe nothing terrible will happen to you of course the quality of life and life in general radically changed i really wanted to solve this situation i somehow learned to cope with panic inside the house doing the most basic things but i needed to live work do all the usual things and it was a huge problem i temporarily solved the issue of moving outside by calling taxis i did not trust myself to drive in such a condition but to jump from home to taxi get to work and quickly inside the building it was hard but possible and so in everything the same way i went to doctors i spent a lot of money and time on examinations i was sure that on that walk in the cold i damaged something i just needed to find what exactly i had mri of everything possible done all vessels head neck endless ecgs and ultrasounds i asked the cardiologist to put full 24 hour monitoring on me yes by that time another fear appeared fear of heart stopping in sleep everything absolutely all tests and analyses were within normal limits i also talked to a neurologist the doctor cautiously suggested the real cause of my sensations offered treatment options but simple sedatives did not help at all and i still refused to try antidepressants i did not want to take strong medication did not want to acknowledge the nature of my attacks and stubbornly tried to find a physical reason in this madness 3 4 months passed despite all examinations everything only got worse also in real life first my girlfriend with whom i had lived for several years got tired of all this now reasoning reasonably i do not blame anyone there was really little left of the person i had been but then of course it was another blow then i had to leave work after my autonomic system psyche very convincingly imitated a heart attack at work it was unbelievable i literally lay on the desk and felt like dying i later googled the symptoms everything matched people around started to panic ambulance came and ecg showed nothing in several months the whole life collapsed everything in it relationship work hobbies self esteem everything completely i was absolutely healthy physically which tests confirmed but i was in deep trouble i read internet forums and saw stories of people living like that for years the thought that i could spend the rest of my life in this panic and fear led to even more panic starting antidepressants i still did not want in my mind that was not an option i did not want to tie my life to pills what did i want to return myself the one i still remembered reading different literature about panic attacks neurosis and autonomic issues i came across the phrase: there are no neuroses in war for me it became the key i thought: what do i have to lose nothing anymore and i decided to start my own war with myself this phrase will sound pompous but i don t know how else to call it i started by accepting that everything was happening in my head here are physical tests they show i m healthy if my autonomic system could do this to me it means i should find a way to roll it back i visualized if you want collected everything i learned about panic fears everything that hindered me created in my mind a collective image of what i sincerely wanted to destroy to get my life back and then next i combined two factors first simpler accept the dark side of the force luke to the madness happening to me i responded with even greater madness all desperation all rage at what happened here is my panic my fear everything that prevents living here am i only one will leave this cage and second harder to explain i really stopped caring how it would end these are not loud words not auto training not motivation i was simply tired of what was happening tired of panic and fear just didn t care on a deep level i will cope or let everything end if i lose fine the samurai is already dead hard to explain it was a state of soul maybe that i reached then the last frontier not because i wanted or i am some hero but because there were no other options for me and that s all i started every day and every minute i poured rage on fear and panic cold rage no shouting or slogans scared to go outside doesn t matter bad scary dying good no problem so what now why didn t i die where is my heart attack stand still i still feel your remains and i don t accept it i will not leave any part of you feels like stroke will happen during exercise fine i will do squats until it happens how much do you need fear 200 times 300 500 i will squat until legs shut down from cramps but i will not give you a chance since i am writing this post now the result is obvious to my surprise everything ended quite fast already in two weeks i walked outside with my camera sat on a bicycle and rode through parks sometimes panic and symptoms tried to return but i already knew what to do with them is that all war over not exactly a burned emotional field remained and depression came seems like i should have celebrated i got what i wanted right but emotional emptiness remained i don t know honestly don t know what part of personality was burned that way but depression came with thoughts okay you won and now what you are alone your money is almost gone no relationship and everything you had is still gone in such melancholic mood i spent another couple of weeks and then then it was summer i sat on my mountain bike to refresh my mind from sad thoughts about what was already lost i rode far from the city weather worsened storm clouds gathered and i turned back of course heavy rain caught me halfway that didn t improve the mood i decided to cut the route through a field road and discovered that trucks were taking wood from the nearby forest and a good road turned into broken mud and then the emotional valve burst heavy thoughts about what was lost in general rain and now this mud instead of road it would be reasonable to turn back a different way but everything poured out of me i rode through the mud seems i screamed cried cursed everything and just rode forward without feeling anything physically moved like a machine all emotions experienced in the last months poured out then the field ended and the road ended i found myself at the edge of a small town on the way home looked at myself at my mountain bike we were both big chunks of mud remembered where the nearest car wash was and tried to ride there didn t work mud and clay clogged wheels pedals switches chain so much that it was impossible to turn them okay put the bike on shoulder and walked to the car wash washed myself washed the bike rode home the chain squeaked unpleasantly i was all wet a railroad passed through that town waiting for the train i stopped at the crossing sat on the bike frame looked around tiredly my eyes stopped on a boy in a wheelchair cars were also waiting for the train and he rolled to them and said something i don t know maybe tried to sell something maybe asked for money the train passed long ago cars left i still sat and looked at one point one thought went in my head: you just plowed through a field of mud with your bike and didn t even notice how you did it you are physically fully healthy that terrible panic does not bother you anymore are you sure you have reasons to be unhappy with your life that day a new different person returned home i won t say he was better than the previous one but life showed how quickly everything settled for this new guy in all areas of life why did i write all this yes everything became good then but life is life difficulties still happen and every time solving them i return in thoughts to that time and think would the old me have handled it and unexpectedly i do not regret that experience recently i had a real physical trauma with the sciatic nerve i wrote about it in the related subreddit how i successfully dealt with it and traditionally returned in my thoughts to those events today i thought and decided to also write this old story about a problem that ruins life for many maybe right now somewhere sits a person with the same level of despair from panic and fears that i had then and just like me then scrolls through the internet in related topics no i will not tell you do as i did i will not wish anyone to dive into that emotional hell i just want to tell you if it seems to you like it seemed to me then that this is hopeless and the end maybe this is only the beginning of something much better find your own path for yourself,panic_disorder

1okz5xq,panic attacks due to changes in routine i m wondering if anyone has had similar experiences and could provide any insight and or advice i ve been experiencing high anxiety for the past few months and had my first panic attack a few months ago it really caught me off guard because while i have dealt with anxiety for many years it s been mostly under control however it has been a stressful year in general due to mental and physical health issues and grief so i don t know if that triggered anything i m noticing a pattern with my panic attacks they seem to come on after any change in routine for example in july i went to a cottage with family for a week this meant some changes to my eating exercise and sleeping routines at the end of the week i woke up in the middle of the night feeling panicky with my heart racing i don t recall having a nightmare that would lead to any panic or fear i took some deep breaths and lay down on my back with my legs elevated and the attack was over in a few minutes i spoke to a doctor about this and based on my symptoms they said i was dealing with panic disorder they said the night episode was a nocturnal panic attack and that they can seemingly come out of nowhere a week ago i was away from home due to a family emergency i just got back home this past sunday again changes to eating exercise and sleeping routines on monday a day after coming home i had another panic attack i was drawing when i felt the same sensation of panic and rush of adrenaline with my heart racing this panic attack felt like it came out of nowhere too i used the same technique as i did with the nocturnal attack to help myself calm down is it possible to have panic attacks due to changes in routine or a build up of stress this has been really hard for me because i love travelling but since the attacks started i ve been worried about having panic attacks while travelling and have been feeling like i m waiting for the other shoe to drop once i get back home again if anyone has had any similar experiences or if you would share what has helped you it d be greatly appreciated thank you so much in advance,panic_disorder

1ohebel,new here new to panic i am so relieved that i have found this community i am 34 years old and my first panic attacks happened back in 2023 and i have never had issues before i ve never suffered from mental health problems i don t honestly know where this stuff has come from but here i am now having severe debilitating panic it is exactly how everybody here has described it it s random it s unexpected it is completely debilitating it s put me in the er shoots my blood pressure through the roof it is purely physiological i ve been through counseling i ve been through mental health therapies i even took six weeks out of intensive care to work on this and i feel like few people really understand especially so far in my experience in the medical community they seem to treat it more as a mental health disorder than a physiological health disorder and every time i get into counseling and every time i get into therapies to work on this i am quickly moved to the other end and pushed out of the therapy because i m not struggling with major stresses in my life i m not struggling with depression in my life and there are people that have mental health disorders that are more serious than what i ve got however that doesn t stop the panic the sheer terror the impending doom and death that looms over me when i have the panic attack i am on medication for the first time in my life and i am a wreck with all of this i am terrified that i m going to continue to have panic the rest of my life i m terrified that it s going to continue to take me away from my family and my kids and my wife i m terrified that i m going to be driving with my children taking them to the zoo and i m going to have a panic moment and i m not going to be able to be there for my kids and instead i m going to have to pray that my seven year old can take care of me and i am just struggling so much with trying to adapt my life to this new way i am on medication right now i am on an ssri i don t have anything for breakthroughs which i happen to be going through right now i am trying to get back in with a counselor and trying to get more serious about having a regular psychiatrist to help me manage my medications but this whole world is new to me and i just am concerned that i am not doing the right things i ve spent so much time trying to talk about this issue with other people that seem confused and this community is the first time i see people who really understand where it s this strange thing where i don t feel like i ve got a mental health problem i have or at least i don t think i ve got a problem where the panic comes from mental stress it s mental stress that s coming from the fear of panic and so i don t know where this panic is coming from and so far the ssri definitely does help and i m thinking at this point i need to go up in my ssri dosage but i just i don t know because this is such a strange thing where it s taking me years to figure out what s going on i have a problem with me to figure out why i ve got this and what the triggers are and where things occur and so far as best i can tell i have issues with eating well it s all based around either eating or cardio i panic if i eat too much i panic if i eat too little i seem to panic if i m having abdominal distress or the abdominal stress comes from the panic i m not sure i m having a breakthrough right now and i think it s a result of heavy drinking over the weekend and a small puking spell but i think i got from some food poisoning and so now all of a sudden my gut is just a complete wreck this weekend and i am having my first breakthroughs in several months and that s one thing i haven t been able to figure out is there something wrong with my stomach my gut how do i manage gut problems with this at 33 years of age i realized that uh some of the cardio issues that i m having and i don t mean issues as an oh i m bad at cardio i was a very athletic individual i was a gymnast and i did a lot of running and so that kind of stuff wasn t a big deal to me but i do remember way way back in in school i did have some minor panic episodes i didn t know what they were at the time but i did have some minor panic episodes all around breathwork breathing and that would start to make me feel lightheaded which then the panic would ensue and that still exists in me today however very recently i have come to the conclusion that if i subconsciously am struggling to manage my breathwork then i need to consciously figure it out and for those of you out there that are also struggling with breathwork i would highly recommend you look into stuff things like the wim hof techniques and other breathing techniques from tibetan monks and stuff like that because it has definitely helped me a lot if my breathing starts to fall out of control i have been able to somewhat regain it or at least at a bare minimum relax my mental burden by simply saying i am in control of it right now and as long as i stay with my breath counts then everything is going to be perfectly fine i m not breathing too much i m not breathing too little and everything is going to be fine and that helps tremendously so if you re having breathwork issues i really really recommend you look into some techniques or there are even apps out there that will help you with breath timing please please look into it my apologies for the billboard of text i m just really excited that i ve found people that experience the same thing that i m going through right now,panic_disorder

1odrtam,how to overcome distressing panic attack symptoms to be honest every symptom of mine has been my hardest at some point however recently my main troubling symptoms been impending doom dpdpr and feeling like i ll go insane it feels incredibly difficult to function when the impending doom hits it automatically triggers dpdr and both the two combined will trigger me into believing something bad is gonna happen and it s going to progress horrifying is a understatement i will began to believe i ll suddnely start hallucinating rapdily and uncontrollably the universe will began to crumble before my eyes and at that point i will already feel gone logically i can acknowledge im still here but feeling wise i feel so crazy detached from what im seeing and hearing im just in a void with my thoughts these have been the most difficult symptoms for me to deal with i used to be scared by physical symptoms because of my hypocondria but bc these symptoms r more on par with existential things they re so hard to ease or logic with im currently in an attack right now but im trying hard to just draw and watch gaming videos but i feel so scared and detached and like my brain posses too much power its very hard to explain sorry if this is written poorly i never can pull together a proper post when im feeling bad i guess i just don t know how to not be scared i know fear fuels it but its so unbearable i guess freaking out is suprisingly what makes me feel better esp when i freak out to relatives 4 comfort or being in the hospital meanwhile dealing with it in silence or proceeding with my day makes it worse and i get stuck in fight or flight over and over again so i have to do something or i wont break out of it i pretty much need my panic to be known for any kind of relief anyways i just wanna know if anyone has advice for me or can relate edit: my most severe panic attacks usually get set off by these symptoms i also have weird deja vu along with these episodes sometimes,panic_disorder
1odpvsx,anxiety relapse for many years i struggled with panic attacks and daily anxiety i finally started antidepressants about 4 years ago sertraline aka zoloft and my life completely turned around for the better i felt mentally healthier than i ever had and i was thriving for about 3 years i thought i was cured but about 6 months ago the panic attacks and anxiety returned my doctor and a psychiatrist told me i was on a very low dose 50mg and over the past few months i ve increased to 100mg i m feeling alot better and no more panic attacks however i still have daily mild anxiety it seems to come out of no where and is quite mild and comes and goes in waves i get more intense anxiety around my previous phobia claustrophobia but still nothing nearly as bad as i felt pre medication i ve been on the new dose for 7 weeks now i wonder is this as good as it gets or should i increase more i will also add that over the past year my environmental stressors have increased financial stress and raising a toddler and i could definitely do more mindfulness work to shift my perspective and thoughts anyway any advice or personal experience with anxiety ssri s is appreciated,panic_disorder

1odht2g,little trick i use for irrational fears i wanted to share with you a little habit that i adopted recently during my panic attacks or moments of great anxiety which allows me to rationalize and calm down more quickly little background story first : personally my panic attacks are mostly accompanied by two symptoms that still frighten me after decades of experience with panic attacks: a tight throat and the feeling of air hunger these symptoms are intrinsically linked to two irrational fears that i have: having an asthma attack or going into anaphylactic shock a severe allergy two things that have never happened to me in 34 years of life so recently i started telling myself the following statements when i start spiraling: i have never had an asthma attack but i have had many panic attacks i have never had anaphylactic shock but i have had many panic attacks etc i wanted to share my new trick with you because it can be applied to many other irrational fears that appear when we panic or are very anxious,panic_disorder

1obns4h,made the mistake of trying to quit sertraline cold turkey and spent the majority of last night in the throes of varying degrees of panic attack tingling shaking heart palpitations and racing the whole shebang luckily my partner is a godsend and he helped me ride through the majority of it ended up only getting around 3 hours of sleep and the only thing that made it somewhat tolerable was holding a pack of ice to my neck breathing exercises but i ve still got that anxious feeling in my chest today more sertraline is en route to me i ve learned my lesson but in the meantime i bought some l theanine capsules to try and combat the anxiety idk what the point of this post was just wanted to get things off my chest i guess has anyone had the same experience with antidepressants withdrawal or tried l theanine,panic_disorder

1oasvy9,it feels like a failing moment i think i ve been diagnosed with my panic disorder for over 10 years and after multiple scenery changes and household moves i started having less symptoms yet from the title of this obviously things happen i don t know if i did this last october but i ve previously realized that october is a weird time for my brain i guess i don t know if its i don t wanna disclose major family business events that seem to fall in the month i don t know if its seasonal yet can t refer to any other part of this season to be remarkable in what comes around no clue now i was was in therapy until i think 2 years ago every week consistent on time insurance is a funny thing and the company had no paid their end to the therapy office and by the time the office found a solution the due time to swap and keep services didn t overlap and a lot of folks lost their appointments and therapists altogether i was one of them however i was coming to a turning point with a different environment and life that when i d first began no longer was i stuck in a mentally abusive situation and career choice was keeping me busy to the point it was healthier so therapy honestly started to feel just like a habit and not something that was continue to proactively educate me now i will never be healed but i was even noticing up front i think losing that was maybe something i needed just to try and see what happens when i let myself be the more raw version of this more adult person i d not let figure the world out for herself and to touch on meds i had take as needed 5 mg of ativan scribed and i broke them suckers in half and they d make me too calm like snap your fingers in my face and yell fire and i had just the blanke stare so i didn t like how my tolerance or lack of responded so when i let therapy go meds went too and honestly a couple hits off a garlic breath indica strain settled me and helped me feel more normal than anything else and i literally mean 2 3 and i was normal so why say all this because for a week now i m deciphering between am i dying or is it me again acting up and its the second one don t feel like it but it always is right its being at work and now i gotta sit in the back and doom scroll and sip water so i don t scare the customers trying to shop telling coworkers hey i m doing weird mental things and it ll pass but i need a minute chest tight breathing manually and feeling now embarrassed that nothing has changed in the last year or so that should make me feel this way and yet here we are in the month of october and its defeating of a feeling and came back the match three games the water sips counting 4 to inhale 6 to exhale in yiur nose out of your mouth all the little things we all learn to try and ground ourselves and it ll pass and i ll be home fine cool as a cucumber i havent smoked a joint since last year either which i rarely did anyway and its a day off where i m choosing to chill and i wake up with the breathing all shallow and familiar warning signs and i m so made at my head cause now its interfering when nothing is happening people keep asking what is it whats the trigger and i m feeling like an idiot because logically theres always a delayed something or another with me and i can not figure it out so i keep getting more stressed of what is it whats the foundation after two two years of not having this response randomly its not being a part of my regimen again and i have zero indication how to make it stop which then because i am comfortable in this which is ironic cause its just my personal being weird and i know it ll pass i ride it out i talk about it and ride it out and feel insane after but better when it finally goes away so tl dr panic attacks have returned after not having them after 2 years any one else feel like a failure when this happens to them,panic_disorder

1o641mc,help needed completely stuck i don t know what to do at the moment for 8 days straight now i ve been having a rolling panic attack started completely out of the blue while i was playing with my son for absolutely no reason i ve had them before but not for a long time now and once i found out what was happening to me i was able to pull myself out of them very quickly then they just stopped completely i was also told at this time that they were made worse and repeated more often than for most people because of my adhd i ve had multiple panic attacks every single day for 8 days now even between attacks it feels like my breathing has switched to manual mode and that i m on the verge of another one at any given time i ve not been able to go into work since this started and i work in a job where i m on commission with no sick pay during this time i ve probably eaten a total of 4 meals as well i m not getting to sleep till 3 4am every day i ve self referred for therapy but they won t be calling me until the 22nd of this month for an initial assessment after that there ll be a bit of a wait until i actually get therapy no other mental health team will speak to me without a referral from my gp i ve also been to a e er when it got really bad in the first couple of days i was seen by 2 lovely mental health team members who basically aren t allowed to do anything other than give advice they ve told me they think i need some short term medication on prescription to tide me over until therapy starts but they re not allowed to prescribe anything i went back to my gp who s prescribed me 10mg tablets of propranolol that i can take 3 times a day he told me to play about with the dose up to 40mg 3x per day this has helped slightly it s reduced the intensity and duration of the panic attacks but i m still having them and they re still bad i phoned the gp back today to tell him the propranolol didn t seem to be working he s now prescribed me a course of anti depressants which will take 4 weeks to start working and up to 8 weeks to start working fully planning to keep me on them for 6 months according to him there s no other option for me at this point i genuinely just want to be chucked into hospital and be put under for a few days and wait for this to all be okay again obviously not an option just how i feel but realistically i just feel like i need something strong some form of benzodiazepine for a couple of weeks to pull me out of this and go back to normal i m just very stuck at the moment any solution seems to be weeks and weeks away and no one seems to be trying to help me medically i m a father of 2 young children and i m completely unable to work like this living in a country uk with public health care is great but i m being horrifically let down by the system on this case sorry for the rant it s nearly 4am and i m so done with this i just need some advice on what to do and if anyone has specific advice for the uk health care system that d be great,panic_disorder

1nz1ebo,can a panic attack last over a day last night or rather the night before i had my second of what i can only assume was a panic attack the first was a bit over a year ago both times were eerily similar i was chillin at home at about 2am totally fine and actually in a pretty good mood then in 5 seconds bam my legs were on fire it was restless legs times a hundred i was trembling in cold sweats and tingling i kept switching between burning and freezing i had what i can only describe as extreme discomfort so bad i was squirming on the ground i even puked and shit my pants just a limittle bit but strangely enough i also felt tired and was even yawning a lot and laughed few times it lasted all through the night no sleep throughout the day while it wasn t as bad as before it was very much alive it was an excruciating day i was able to sleep a few times once for an hour and once for a few and each time i felt a bit better after but still suffering even my shit looked and smelled very strange it wasn t until this morning that i was mostly normal and about now at 5pm that i feel completely normal i prayed to god after the first time that l d never go through that again but here i am in the aftermath of that i could bear that for an hour maybe a few but over a day was unlike anything i ever experienced i used to be convinced it wasn t a panic attack it was too physiological like an actual sickness but the more i look into it the more i see a panic attack is the only thing that fits but still can it really last over a day like 32 hours and for that to happen twice now does this sound like what your panic attacks are like and have they ever lasted this long edit: i also wanna know ab y all s experience with meds tho obviously my psychiatrist will help i m sure some benzo would work if it happened again but to be honest i don t want to have benzos in my possession ik there s others that can help in this scenario but for something this extreme would it be enough to stop it when it happens,panic_disorder

1nvq229,made my bubble so small that i no longer get panic attacks before you say you don t have panic disorder i ve been diagnosed and suffered for ten years with it it rules my life and has ruined it but i havent had one in months my attacks are situational and because i don t see people or get into situations where it s possible anymore they ve stopped i m unemployed with no hobbies or anything to do all day besides walk my dog and watch movies with my parents you might say that doesn t sound too bad but i m in my twenties all my friends are building their careers and dating and moving forward in life what makes me feel insane is that i can actually do a lot i just have to be alone with safe family members i grocery shop alone i workout alone i drive i get coffee but it s all painfully lonely i don t have social anxiety but my panic disorder shows up in social situations because i m not in control i have a phobia that makes me panic snd sometimes faint if i even hear certain words haemaphohia because this has happened so many times my brain equates socialising and being far from home with danger anyways i m just wondering if anyone else is in the same boat i ve only ever heard people say their panic disorder is random and they either still have lives or it stops them doing anything at all like leaving the house i know i m privileged in that i can but it can be its own torture it s like still being in prison but with a vr headset of what could be i m sick of doing the same things alone and not being able to do things like take a class or meet a friend for coffee,panic_disorder
1nvnywv,panic attacks as soon as i eat hi so this situation is a little strange and i m not sure where to go i m kind of worried this is a kind of vent seeking advice kind of post i guess so i ve always had stomach issues my stomach is very sensitive and i can feel very nauseous after eating drinking anything even if it s healthy recently it randomly got worse so i became scared of eating again and started eating less i don t want to eat at all but obviously i have to otherwise my body gets weak and i experience terrible side effects but every time i try to eat a meal like something more than literally a single piece of lettuce i ve gotten panic attacks or panic like symptoms instantly out now where while eating this is just making me even more scared of eating and i m terribly confused as to why this always happens why does this happen i become strange and dissociate hyper aware anytime i eat even a small meal and my heart starts racing i ve already lost a lot of weight and it s probably damaging my body a whole lot i m afraid of eating but i can t bring myself to do it because i get forced into a panic attack by my stupid body who can t handle anything why does this happen does it happen to anybody else and what the hell do i do i m gonna die if this keeps happening i can t do the things i once enjoyed because i am constantly so weak and tired,panic_disorder

1nuu204,felt the need to say this hope it helps others as well i m 32 have been having anxiety issues for most of my adult life and for a long time maybe the first handful years from 18 to about 24 i denied its existence not effectively i would find myself incapable of doing things normal people would do like go to classes in college or do overly social things but i didn t speak to anyone about it friends or family felt saying it aloud would only serve to make it real that was a massive mistake and i would recommend no one go down that path it almost led to my own demise what snapped me out of it was my mother getting diagnosed with breast cancer it didn t fix anything perssay but it gave me a different view on life gave me a purpose even if it was temporary which was to help and take care of her she struggled for years for a bit it looked like she might beat it but ultimately it metastasized into her bones making her weaker and into her brain spinal fluid making her terminal the combination of disease surgeries and chemo radiation therapy left her unable to walk or do most things for herself but she wanted to spend as much times with her grandkids my brothers children my niece and nephew so she fought and she was able to turn a 6 month prognosis into 2 years of which i took care of her that purpose was the only thing keeping me together and i needed her to be as comfortable as possible i like to think that i did what i did for her others have even gone as far as to call me a hero everything i did for her i was a full caretaker 24 7 fed her gave her baths changed her diaper took her to almost every doctor s appointment surgeries chemo radiation kept up with all of her medications which were allot and im sure there was more i can t think of right now but i never felt that way i felt failed her in every single way because i couldn t stop the tidal wave that was coming to take her away i know that isn t true but the brain works in weird ways and im trying my best to understand that when she passed it took me a bit to process everything the end was horrendous and is something that will haunt me until the ends of my days hell it was years ago now but im not sure how much progress ive made on that front but almost immediately me and my family came to a sort of pain bond where we all knew each other s pain and only wanted to help then my stepsister from my father s side moved in and ruined everything but that story is for another day the reason i bring it up is because my entire family brother and his kids and father were living together when she passed but my step sister started series of events that would cause my father to sell the house making everyone move out this was maybe a year after my mother passed my step sister made sure to not move in until she passed because my mother always knew she was bad news she was 100 percent right after that storm my brother and i moved into a house together and my father got himself a much smaller house not to far from us for a long time i was so occupied with life and loss that the feelings of anxiety and panic for myself that i dealt with before almost disappeared i find that if im doing things for others i can pull out this otherworldly will that i can never seem to muster for myself well recently maybe a year ago it started coming back anxiety panic attacks sending me to the hospital vomiting for days on end the episodes get dark i get past them and become myself again but my will power was waning still is but this time i made a change and finally went to the doctor she gave my hydroxyzine for now while they run tests and said we will revisit this with the results inhand to rule out potential external factors while its only the beginning of everything and i dont truly know where this road leads for the first time in a long time i feel a bit hopeful like i m finally doing something right if you are struggling please talk to your doctor friends and family don t just let the panic attacks erode your will like waves onto rock because eventually you ll find yourself sinking into the sands left over people care and are willing to help you you matter you are loved you will make it thanks for reading this long post edit: i realized a wall of text is a bit daunting so i broke it into paragraphs as my english teacher would have wanted,panic_disorder

1nsy2t4,how to not fear scary symptoms sorry if this is written poorly exhausted after an episode and not fully relaxed yet i have pretty severe issues i basically developed constant dpdr from this disorder but along with that when i m attacks are really bad they take at least 2 hours to go away during these big attacks it always starts with a weird feeling of uncertainty i wouldn t even call it impending doom but maybe it is just something feels off but it s a feeling i can t describe then after a few minutes i ll eventually get some weird symptom like my vision is zooming out very difficult to explain since it s not quite that not tunnel vision either it triggers a weird out of body expierence then i feel faint i never actually get dizzy but i feel very much floaty i feel like i ll pass out at any point which thankfully i never have but god it gets bad in the store i was in hell i dropped my drink because my fingers felt like they didn t work it wasn t even paralysis all i know is that it didn t feel like my hand and i couldn t control it like my hand just didn t work my legs started feeling like jelly the derealization was intense cuz everything felt like it d fade in an instant then things started feeling like something bad was really about to happen which intensifies everything the tremors started and then eseclates to my arm trembling against my will getting tingly and throbbing like my heart was racing in my arm i felt like passing out i felt like i was trying to balance on a balance beam and without fail my right eye always squints up during these moments which has always made me paranoid cause i ve never heard this happening to anyone else so i look like i got a lemon squeezed in my eye the entire time and it s like my own brain has the shakes too it s so scary and nobody understands i ll cry beg to go to the hospital and i ll get ignored because i have to put up with it to get better and unrelated to my medication i also get such heavy eyelids during the attack and after which makes me more anxious because it s like i am fighting to stay awake so now it adds another problem because at that point if i give in and sleep while having the attack i m gonna die this isn t what i mean when i referred to feeling like passing out earlier either it s a seperate issue i feel like this one isn t a true sleep rather fatigue that will lead to me losing consciousness and likely dying and i am currently off of zoloft i only did a few days a few weeks ago because it turned up my anxiety to insane levels and i was basically begging everyday to be sent to a mental hospital and geniunely couldn t cope with the side effects and lost a lot of weight that made the doctor concerned but i do take hydroxozine and i did in fact take it right when the weird feeling first started to simmer but my medication low key doesn t work on severe attacks when it s these major ones it usually falls flat and i gotta wait it out i am feeling a bit better and i did nothing but lie in bed it s been an hour and i still am out of it in the sense that i can t really process that i m alive right now since everything seems fake so heavy on the dpdr i just wanna know how do you not think ur gonna die during these moments i can have it time and time again and i m still gonna believe this is gonna be the one i think it s because it s so consistent and has specific symptoms it makes me fear i have a brain issue that s going unnoticed i have been checked 3 times cause i went to the hospital 3 times within weeks of each other and they ve done bloodwork and other tests on me and i m always medically cleared yet i ve never been given an mri which is what i ve wanted the most because i know deep down i fear i really do have some brain disease it s just hard to accept or understand my anxiety can be so debilitating or scary it truly feels like death is approaching,panic_disorder
1nshbt1,panic attack recovery 6 months later and where i m at now hi everybody i wanted to share my story because i was desperately searching this sub when i was at my worst here s my story: i ve always struggled with anxiety and the occasional panic attack maybe once every few years but always moved on from them after they happened never thought twice about it in december of 2024 i was sick with a bad cold and woke up to have the worst panic attack of my life this in combination with being ill caused me to pass out throw up all the symptoms it was horrendous from then on i developed and was diagnosed with panic disorder that one bad panic attack sent me into a completely overwhelmed state for months i couldn t leave my house i dropped out of my first semester of senior year of college quit my job i thought i was broken forever i truly could not imagine being normal again i even stopped driving for a period of time i finally decided i needed help and that it was not something i could just get over i started seeing my therapist weekly instead of biweekly started working on exposures which was not something i was doing before as i never had any sort of panic attack fears and the big one which i know is a hard pill to swallow literally was medication i started zoloft in february and worked my way up to a comfortable dose which i have leveled out at now things were extremely hard for about 4 months but now i m back at school in person driving working going on trips going to crowded places like restaurants etc in the time i started my medication i ve only had 2 panic attacks which have not been as debilitating as the others i truly thought healing was not possible but it is mental health is a personal responsibility try the medication even if you don t want to do the exposures even if it feels impossible and most importantly believe you will get better this is not to say you won t ever struggle after recovery there are still small things i have to work up the courage to do to get fully comfortable with for example driving on the freeway by myself and being alone when my husband goes out of town for work occasionally especially sleeping without my husband however these are things that i know i can overcome because i have the right tools and i ve overcome very hard things that i felt were impossible when i was at my worst even if you try over and over and you feel like you re failing keep going and take the damn meds they are truly what will give you the ability to use your tools so you can actually heal,panic_disorder

1nq80w4,cardio without panic i wanted to share with you a small victory in my life recently i have been living with panic disorder with agoraphobia since 2023 my 2nd time in 34 years of life my anxiety symptoms are very linked to sensations with my heart and lungs i am always afraid of being out of breath of running out of air of my heart beating fast etc at the beginning of my panic disorder i had so much cardiophobia that i didn t dare do anything that could increase my heart rate coffee sugar fat large meals climbing stairs lifting heavy things sex etc however ironically before that i was a very active person i did hiit workouts 5 to 6 times a week but as soon as my panic disorder started it was as if all of a sudden i felt like i was made of crystal like a was ultra fragile anyway yesterday i was finishing yet another cardio workout at home when i suddenly realized what i had just done a cardio workout driving my heart to 180bpm and leaving me breathless and yet i wasn t anxious or afraid yes i had physical sensations that could have sent me spiraling into anxiety and panic but these sensations were buried under endorphins pride the feeling of regaining control etc i wanted to share it with you because people often point out to me how much i stop myself from being proud of my healing journey and i think i m probably not the only one here who has trouble celebrating the small victories accomplished in order to get better i would be lying if i said that overnight i went from being cardiophobic to being able to train in gym classes and do cardio at home i went through several difficult and scary steps to get there but it is possible and it is valid to have to relearn how to do certain things that for the majority of the population seem normal we all experience our own personal challenges and difficulties and we all deserve to be able to celebrate our small victories when they occur,panic_disorder
1nq0d69,2 weeks panic attack free hi everyone almost 3 months ago i had what i believed to be a heart attack ended up in er because of severe chest pain that radiated to left arm and jaw sob loss of feeling in extremities i m an emt so ik all the signs and symptoms and was 100 convinced i was having a cardiac event since then i ve probably had about 50 of these events every er visit had been normal every ekg blood test echocardiogram stress test and holter monitor all normal i was given zoloft to take and have been taking it for the past month my panic attacks seem to have kinda stopped which is good but all the zoloft side effects are killing me however in all of this i ve noticed the past 4 5 days my resting heart rate has dropped significantly and my standing walking hr has dropped like my rhr went from 80 90 to like 60 70 and my standing hr was usually 90 115 and now it can be anywhere from 65 100 still very normal ranges however it s just strange that it s dropped is this just me being paranoid or is this a normal reaction to the panic attacks stopping and my body calming down a little bit thanks,panic_disorder

1np9snb,pd from glp 1 hi all this a little long so i m sorry so i m one of the good chunk of people who have developed a pretty severe panic disorder due to glp 1 injections at least i think i didn t think it was the case until i found a separate group of people on fb having the same identical issues some only taking a few shots and some being on it for a year 8 months for me i have zero history of anxiety and all of a sudden on 8 21 it felt like i kept needing to take a deep breath so i went to the drs and she put me on lexapro and said it ll most likely get worse before it actually kicks in let me tell you i only took it for 3 days because it threw me into a psychosis which lasted almost a week but ever since then i ve been getting severe panic attacks for no reason and sucidal idiation which i ve also never had in my life snd im not sure where the thoughts are even coming from i m now filled with adrenaline all day and night i m on propranolol which i felt like only helped for a day or two and kolonapin which i was only taking once a week when i would take i would be fine for days but now it only seems to help for the day i m still not wanting to take it often even though my dr said he would be okay with daily i m not i keep spiraling down this hole of what if this is forever i m barely getting any sleep due to these adrenaline surges i ve gone to the hospital 4 times now for all different reasons and each time they said it was anxiety one of them i was actually relaxing and then i became extremely light headed and my blood pressure shot up to hypertension crisis so of course i freaked out thankfully many people in the glp 1 anxiety group said it eventually does clear up for them as their body heals from no longer being on the shot but the recovery times for everybody are all over the place tldr glp 1 gave me panic disorder keeps feeling like i m dying how are you coping,panic_disorder

1noexzp,first flight in 12 years hi all i just wanted to share a recent small victory recovery moment until last week i hadn t flown in 12 years on that flight 12 years ago i remembered having such a horrendous panic attack that i swore i d never fly again surely no holiday could possibly be worth that living hell flying hung over me as my absolute worst fear for the past decade i missed out on great memories with family and friends as well as some really awesome work and study opportunities a few months ago i decided enough was enough i was determined to prove to myself that i didn t have to live like this drawing on my years of therapy including a lot of exposure work i booked myself in for a 2 hour flight to spain it wasn t comfortable i panicked a lot especially during takeoff and bits of turbulence but it also wasn t anywhere near as bad as i had expected as i have discovered time and time again with this disorder the thoughts fear surrounding the experience were so so much worse than the reality of doing it i ve now booked myself in for 2 more flights in the next 6 months i m looking forward to making up for lost time and making another big step forward in telling panic disorder agoraphobia to go f ck itself and living a life free of unnecessary fear wishing everyone reading this strength in your own journeys i am finally starting to believe this thing can be mostly beaten,panic_disorder

1nnnmcp,struggling moving out 29 i m 29 and i just signed a lease with a friend on paper it s a good move affordable close to work a chance at independence but the reality i feel crushed i used to live away from home in college and was fine i even enjoyed the rhythm of being on my own but coming home on weekends eventually only coming home occasionally on breaks and whatnot then covid happened i moved back home at 24 and stayed over time i got used to the comfort of my mom being in the next room and my dog sleeping nearby they became my daily anchors now the finality of moving out at this age feels unbearable i keep panicking at the thought that we ll never live together again that it s the end of an era not just a new beginning even though i m only moving 20 minutes away it feels like a huge emotional loss i know people will say you re supposed to move out by now but it s not that simple my anxiety recently diagnosed as severe panic disorder makes change feel like an earthquake i don t want to feel like a failure for struggling with something so many people treat as normal i guess i just needed to put this out there has anyone else felt this way like the finality of moving out later in life hit harder than the first time how did you cope,panic_disorder
1nnn5y7,what s wrong with me hii everyone i d love to have an outside perspective on my situation since i haven t been able to talk to anyone who really understands yet i m 20f and i ve had health anxiety since i was a child some years were worse some years better when i was around 15 i spent a whole year convinced i had leukemia and no doctor could convince me otherwise eventually that passed but i started developing more ocd like symptoms i d always have a specific fear in my mind and would feel like i had to do little rituals to prevent it from coming true which i still have to this day but it s much more manageable i ve been to therapy mutliple times but after a few months i usually started feeling normal again and felt like i have no reason to be there so i d stop last year i went through a breakup and spiraled a bit i started binge drinking socially got myself into a few unsafe situations and ended up in a depressive episode for a few months eventually i got better for about half a year i was doing really well drinking less doing well at school and work and feeling less anxious overall though i was isolating myself a bit out of fear of losing control again this summer i went to japan for a short uni program with my friend it was my first time so far away from home and my parents but i was really happy and excited the first night i was fine but when we went to sleep i became super aware of my heartbeat the more i focused on it the faster it got until i panicked and thought i was having a medical emergency we called an ambulance but they said i was okay i ve had panic attacks before but always for a specific reason this one felt like it came completely out of nowhere although i do think it s because i was in a new situation 10 thousand kilometers away from home and tried to ignore the anxiety this caused me i was also jetlagged and i severely lacked sleep because of this episode i became more aware of my body and started monitoring myself which made me really anxious and a few days later it happened again this time also with shortness of breath dizziness and chest pain i was also taking hormonal pills to delay my period at the time and i thought they could ve also contributed to this so i stopped taking them things calmed down for a bit and when i got home i tried to move on but then it happened again when i was at home and in a calm environment not stressed at all i told my parents and insisted on going to the er because i was convinced something was physically wrong they did a bunch of tests ekg blood work iv fluids and told me everything looked fine i followed up with my doctor and asked about seeing a cardiologist but she said it wasn t necessary and that it was definitely just stress since then the cycle keeps repeating i ll feel fine for weeks then i ll notice a symptom like feeling a little short of breath which makes me spiral and then i end up having another episode at first it was just heart palpitations now it can be shakiness dizziness shortness of breath hot flashes and a general sense of panic thinking i m going to die the worst of it usually only lasts a few minutes but the anxiety from it can linger all day i ve developed a big fear of being alone especially at night i m scared i ll have a medical emergency and nobody will know until it s too late i m starting therapy again and maybe considering medication based on what the ll tell me but i still can t shake the feeling that something is wrong with me physically even though all my tests were clear what scares me mostly is that there is never a specific trigger other than noticing physical symptoms recently i got a message that triggered me and caused me to really panic and it almost felt better than these episodes because i knew i at least have a valid reason to panic and i don t have to worry that i ll die i also don t know whether to classify the epiosdes as panic attacks the panic attacks i ve had in the past were a long time ago and always due to a clear specific trigger but i remember them feeling different than this sorry if this is too long i didn t want to leave anything out has anyone experienced something similar i ll appreciate any insight or help thank you :,panic_disorder
1nnh14e,life sucks guys two years ago my life completely changed one night i was perfectly healthy and normal and the next day i started getting panic attacks out of nowhere that one day caused me to be in a cycle of around 30 panic attacks per day for about a month going from one er to the next within a singular week all tests come back normal you re not going to die your heart is fine your lungs are fine and you re just convinced that you will die and no one believes you at some point during that month i genuinely believed that i have died and now im in hell and this is my punishment or something after two months of trying to deal with whats happening i wasnt eating i lost around 70 pounds within a span of 5 6 months in that year alone due to not eating dont know how i didnt die i happen to be an international student so i took a 26 hr trip back home hoping that my heart doesnt stop mid way to my country because i could not handle being alone and going through this i felt better surrounded by friends and family went to a gi specialist went to a cardiologist and finally went to a psychiatrist he diagnosed me with panic disorder and gad and prescribed xanax and propranolol and sulpiride this all sucks because it changed my life forever i used to be someone who wouldnt fear shit and now i feel fear like nothing else i used to be a big introvert now im extremely extroverted just so that i could be surrounded by people in order to be distracted enough to not feel the constant pain in my chest i used to be a gym bro and now the thought of going to the gym sends me into a spiral because what if my heart stops what if i faint what if i trigger a panic attack see no one understands how this feels unless they were experiencing it and i wouldnt wish this upon anyone especially that it started out of nowhere imagine where one day you were fine and the next your whole life completely changed out of nowhere and for no reason this started on march 22nd 2023 and now its almost going to be 3 years i survive off of xanax daily not exactly addicted as when i was in my home country i went without it for two months as i was distracted day after day but when im alone its really bad my woman is on the phone with me 24 7 she watches me sleep because baby could you make sure im actually breathing while sleeping she doesnt mind shes a godsend who i will forever love but it doesnt feel the same as being around people physically i have friends where i study tons of them but i dont feel the security of being back home i am a senior i graduate next semester but i wanted to be a doctor and now i feel like i could never be for years now i tried searching for causes not as much solutions because i was confused how did this start what triggered it i mean i used to have depression as a teenager but dont most teenagers go thru that to end this vent session i will admit i am better than when all of this started as i do go out i do go to my classes even if i have to take my pills with me everywhere i go it does get a little better i talked to my psychiatrist and i told him that from what i know disorders dont go away and he said that panic disorder is actually one of the disorders that do go away and two years are a short time for recovery it just takes alot of effort alot of rationalizations and faith that hey i will get better,panic_disorder

1nmqiqq,always out of breath i got diagnosed about 3 years ago and had over 30 panic attacks i ve managed and lived with it but the thing i struggle with the most is the sudden random shortness of breath i can be a little tired or out of the blue and suddenly feel my chest tighten like it s harder to breathe than usual or sometimes its the sudden increase in heartbeat like my heart is gonna jump out of my chest there s no specific reason it just happens out of nowhere has anyone else experienced this edit: i ve realized maybe it s a kind of mini version of panic attacks but it happens so often maybe daily to the point it s more exhausting than the big ones the only thing that works is taking a break for hours or i can take my meds diazepam 2 mg and alprazolam 0 5 but i feel like they shouldn t be taken daily so i don t know how to cope,panic_disorder

1nm95es,nocternal panic help tldr: what helped your nocternal panic attacks if you ever dealt with jolting awake in panic what made your symptoms better and do you have any advice besides medication i don t want to take it personally but not i m shaming anyone who does to give a little background i have dealt with panic disorder intermittently since i was a teenager going through periods of severe anxiety and constant panic attacks these periods lasting a several months at a time but usually never more than a year the rest of the time i still have anxiety and the occasional panic attack but not to the point that it affected my life much the current episode started 2 years ago and is the worst i have ever experienced in the weeks leading up to it i could feel myself becoming highly sensitized and my nervous system was getting seriously out of wack like it never had before i had that something big is about to happen feeling on the night it finally boiled over i had a major panic attack that caused me to develop neural circuit dizziness pppd i started to feel like my body was swaying constantly and the feeling never went away to this day in the following year i struggled with agoraphobia because being away from home made the feeling worse that first year i only got much worse i was so afraid of my symotoms because they were so hard to bear my body was like a clenched fist 24 7 in anticipation of the next attack during this time i was consuming a lot of content about panic disorder and pppd trying very hard to follow advice and heal myself which only made it a lot worse i also developed very frustrating problems at night: my body was absolutely terrified of going to sleep every single night the very second i start to drift i would feel an explosion of panic in my chest and jolt awake gasping i would do this at least 15 20 times a night then sometimes i would have one so bad that i would wake up already screaming and jumping out of bed sometimes landing on the floor from being tangled in my blanket sometimes already to my bedroom door before i would fully wake up and realize that i was okay this past year i made a lot of progress i slowely desensitized myself to things i was deathly afraid of like going into grocery stores and i mostly just tried to ignore my symptoms instead of focussing so much on them which helped a lot i had to just let it run its course and eventually without any real effort on my part besides forcing myself to go places i didn t want to go my body eventually realized that it was safe i feel like i can go anywhere and i m not spending everyday in fear of when the next panic attack will come i ve had maybe 2 in the past 6 months the swaying feeling is still constant but i ve learned to live with it it doesn t ignite panic anymore so i couldn t care less about it the thing that puzzels me is the lack of progress with my nocternal symptoms the number of times i jolt awake in panic are less maybe 5 10 times a night and ones where i jump out of bed screaming are less often but still happen occasionally but this improvement seems to have capped out around maybe april while everything else has continued getting better it s like the clenched fist is loosened during the day but it tightens right back up at night i don t want to jinx it because i think letting go of trying to fix my symptoms was what made things get better but i m starting to get frustrated again i ve tried doing facial and scalp massages to relieve tension yoga before bed reading warm baths i ve never found meditation helpful i m at a loss of what i should do,panic_disorder

1nhqi47,xanax to manage panic i struggle with panic disorder mostly around speaking or presenting when i m the sole focus especially with execs even something as simple as introducing myself in front of a room can trigger a panic attack it started in 2018 after a big conference where i had my first full blown attack thought it was a heart attack ended up in the hospital since then my brain just won t let it go on video calls i can sometimes numb it with alcohol but obviously that doesn t work in person i ve tried things like ka chava and beta blockers beta blockers help a little but not with the buildup i m curious about people s experiences using xanax situationally for this type of anxiety i wouldn t want to be on it full time still planning to keep up with therapy cbt breathing etc but wondering if it s been helpful for anyone else in similar situations also open to program recommendations that worked for you,panic_disorder

1naz780,buspar for panic disorder i am 25f have panic disorder w cluster c traits i dont have panic attacks every single day but i am constantly warding them off and its exhausting my current medication regimen is 225mg venlafaxine 100mg sertraline 1mg flupentixol originally it was just the venlafaxine and flupentixol but the sertraline was added to help my pmdd and to make it possible to taper off the flupentixol i have been on this dose for about 5 weeks and my pmdd is near non existent now and i do feel generally better in myself i do however still have to use my emergency diazepam sometimes like for my driving lessons but before i needed 10mg last week i was able to just take 5mg and have a good time diazepam doesn t make me sleepy at all propanalol does so it is totally safe for me to use when driving i wasn t really able to talk to my preferred doctor about which extra antidepressant i wanted i got a doctor i still like but wasnt there for when i was really ill so he doesnt have the full context that my regular doctor does i did ask him to talk to my old psychiatrist bc im no longer in crisis ive been discharged from psychiatry and he said i could either have buspar or sertraline the gp went for sertraline probably because its extremely common here in the uk my mum takes it for depression and its been great for her i am generally having a good time on sertraline and i hope i can make a small taper to my antipsychotics in the christmas holidays at least i am also aware it hasnt been the full 6 weeks so i may feel even better with more time i do however wonder if buspar would ve been better for me since it works like a benzo apparently and benzos are an absolute lifesaver for me but as i learned the hard way as a teenager with an incompetent child psychiatrist i cannot take benzos every single day bc i got addicted and the withdrawal made me housebound i have been taking the benzos as an when needed for about 2 years with my tolerance going up slightly originally i used 2mg pills i use 5mg pills now but i don t take them every single day i am only given 15 pills per month and that generally lasts just over a month i am wondering if people who have been on buspar for panic disorder have had a good experience and been able to largely stop using benzos bc of it i am aware that buspar is apparently great for generalised anxiety disorder but its not a well established treatment for panic disorder so i decided to ask you guys,panic_disorder

1na60ik,i fainted at the dentist hi all i was diagnosed with panic disorder about 12 years ago when i was in grad school after my first panic attack when i was first diagnosed i was prescribed a low dose of clonazepam to take as needed after about 3 years the panic has subsided to the point where i forgot i even struggled with it and haven t taken medication in about 7 years fast forward to two months ago i go into the dentist for an implant procedure and i warn them that my usual dentist avoids giving me numbing that contains epinephrine because it s made me feel sick heart racing in the past they gave me epinephrine anyway and i passed out for the first time in my life i m talking within 30 seconds i feel sick to my stomach and lights out no big lead up i wrote it off as a sensitivity to the medication and that s that then two weeks ago i am in for a follow up and they remember me we speak about absolutely no epinephrine they gave me what they claim is lidocaine but within 30 seconds lights out again i didn t think much of it and assumed maybe the cotton swab they give you first had some epi in it without realizing the next day i m getting my haircut and suddenly my brain is like hey what if those two times you passed out weren t due to epinephrine at all but it was just a panic attack what if this is a thing now and you can pass out at any time so i had my first full blown panic attack in 10 years right there in the barber chair no one noticed i think but i had to have my wife come pick me up because i was worried about fainting while driving if i had definitive proof that there was epi in the numbing in my last visit i think i would be able to reconcile what s happening and make myself believe i won t just pass out randomly but that s almost impossible now i can barely go in public drive go to work without constantly thinking that i might faint and either crash my car or embarrass myself which in turn causes panic attacks anyone else have something similar to this happen to them or how they got over it i don t really know what i plan on getting out of this post just venting at this point and maybe to gleam some hope that people don t just faint from panic attacks without a build up,panic_disorder

1n6yi44,emergency meds for the past 7 months i ve been having severe anxiety mostly at night and panic attacks multiple times a week as a result i now structure my days around my anxiety which sucks horribly my therapist is fantastic andwe re working on dbt and unpacking whatever is causing my anxiety my psychiatrist prescribed me 5mg lorazepam to take in emergencies and i get 5 pills each month it does help in the moment but i end up hoarding the pills and not always taking it when i should because i m afraid i ll be left without my safety when i really need it she doesn t want to give me more and instead added hydroxyzine as needed in tandem with gabapentin which i ve been taking since this all started i ve also been on zoloft for 3 months to manage the anxiety this anxiety cocktail just doesn t seem like enough it s all so debilitating and i m on so many meds that hardly seem to do anything for me i think this is just a vent post but i m welcoming any tips advice for managing the anxiety or finding a compromise my psychiatrist :,panic_disorder

1n6xa78,consistent numb feeling hi everyone me again about a week ago i had a panic attack that lasted several hours and one of the symptoms i had was my left forearm arm began feeling numb as well as a bit of my face my medical anxiety made me extremely worried that i was about to have a stroke i didn t and that anxiety has still been with me all week it s been 5 days and my arm still sometimes feels like it s numb or like it s not even part of my body but it functions just fine feels pain can be raised can hold things heavy weight like normal etc same for part of my cheek but less so i gotta add i m noticing it usually only feels this way when i m not doing anything else or rather have time to focus on it because when i m not occupying myself otherwise it s usually the only thing my brain does decide to focus on like automatic paranoia does anyone else have experience with this limbs feeling odd for a prolonged time post panic attack it never felt like this before only once the attack happened i may still get it looked at but i just want some advice note: this was my first proper panic attack came on suddenly with no warning compared to my usual anxiety attacks,panic_disorder

1n5c4fc,bring it on approach hi everyone i thought i d share this since it s the only thing so far that i ve found helps with panic attacks in the moment and with the worry about having them i heard kimberly quinlan host of your anxiety toolkit podcast talk in one episode about her struggles with panic attacks and how she now utilizes and encourages others to try the bring it on approach essentially when you feel one coming on aggressively confront it i e say to yourself bring it on or something like ok hit me when you stop trying to settle the panic attack it only usually makes it worse i tried the bring it on approach and it surprisingly works quite well for me sharing in case anyone else could find it helpful this approach stems from your own willingness to feel the anxiety and symptoms of panic you first have to be willing with the knowledge that a panic attack can t actually hurt you once you re willing you can implement the aggressive confrontation i hope this can help someone else the way it helped me and check out kimberly quinlan s podcast all about anxiety your anxiety toolkit super helpful,panic_disorder
1n4np3u,klonopin experience i m not sure if this is the right community to post this in so apologies if it s not appropriate i went to the emergency room hospital because my legs were shaking uncontrollably in extreme pain i was given 0 5mg klonopin i was told it is sometimes used for restless leg syndrome and since my legs were involuntary shaking i assumed it would help they sent me home with 6 pills that were 0 5mg with instructions to take 1 2 pills before bed if needed i went home and took another 0 5mg of klonopin within 60 mins my legs were feeling some relief but i still could not sleep and felt a sense of panic i decided to take another 0 5mg in total i ve now taken 1 5mg now this is were it gets weird i remember falling asleep and my panic disappearing everything after that i vaguely remember like it was a fever dream i vaguely remember getting out of bed 4 to 5 times and having a hot shower but i could hardly walk straight and was not able to balance myself i guess i felt drunk in a way i remember waking up a few times with intense dehydration i remember being so incredibly tired i couldn t even standup for more then 3 mins without falling back into bed i vaguely remember waking up multiple times from super realistic feeling dreams like reading a comic book word for word and seeing the pictures even though i don t own a comic book lmao i wake up finally somewhat coherent the next day and a half and notice my bottle of klonopin is empty and on the floor under my bed what the hell i do not remember taking any more then the hospital dose and the two 0 5mg pills at home that means i took 3 5mg of klonopin total i am so confused then i notice a huge chuck of skin taken out of my thumb i must ve cut it on something but i can t find blood anywhere or what i might hurt it on i am still feeling very very very tired i ve had to stop what i m doing multiple times today to sleep my leg back and neck muscles are indescribably sore and tender it is almost impossible to bend down my leg muscles are so sore my mind is blank i have no thoughts just confusion i guess i m wondering if anyone else has had an experience with klonopin where you unknownly took more pills,panic_disorder

1n3guzy,panic during interview i had a job interview an hour ago and i was doing pretty well but found myself getting into these waves of panic when i talked i felt okay but when they were talking to me i felt extremely overstimulated and panicked i felt hot and dizzy and deep breathing and drinking water wasn t really helping i tried not to seem noticeable so i was being agreeable and smiling a decent amount but i m worried they noticed it seemed to go well but i m being so hard on myself i m tired of being this way i got laid off because my company branch closed and i hate that i m in this desperate situation to get a job but the company i just interviewed with i actually like so i feel a lot of pressure and i thought this would be the last interview because i did 2 with the hiring manager who would be my boss and today s 3rd one with the hiring manager plus another team member which i think is the reason that i panicked she mentioned there would be another interview with other team members and that just made me so overwhelmed because if i acted like that today i m worried it ll happen again next time even meditating and taking half an alprazolam didn t fully work and lately i ve had to take them more often because i had to put my cat down a few weeks ago who was my best friend for 14 years there have been so many circumstances this past year that have made me have frequent panic attacks and i really don t even know how to manage it at this point i m scared and tired,panic_disorder

1n38pse,panic attacks on planes i ll have to fly tomorrow morning and i m afraid in january i developed bad agoraphobia went on one flight since then and it was very bad never had one on my previous four flights i went on before developing agoraphobia i had a panic attack upon departure i was tense while looking for my seat i sat down and as the people started boarding i felt the tension rise the seat felt uncomfortable my heart began accelerating i started feeling shaky and my hands were sweating as the plane began moving on the tarmac i went into full panic mode i knew there was nothing i could do at that point to go back or escape i was trapped there whether i liked it or not no way out for one hour and a half the panic attack lasted 20 mins a flight attendant asked me if everything was fine she said i was pale and sweating i said i was having a panic attack she said oh okay and proceeded with her duties which leads me to believe it is a common occurrence for them but even tho it happened twice once when going and then when returning home i am scared i ll have one again the feeling of dread of pure fear knowing you have nowhere to escape to is terrifying,panic_disorder
1n36a9z,in an ativan predicament i have had health anxiety that progressed into panic disorder over the last couple years i have been in therapy and started spacing out the frequency of the panic attacks usually when i do have panic attacks they make me think i m dying sometimes send me to the er and then i typically fall asleep that night and tend to recover about 8 days ago i had a bad panic attack sortof out of the blue usually they are more closely tied to an upcoming event this particular one made it to where i couldn t sleep for 2 or 3 days or eat i went to the hospital because i was collapsing and they gave me 1mg of ativan which worked like a charm they also wanted me to get on lexapro which i have never gotten on am ssri before long story short i have been taking the ativan daily at 75mg 1 time at night for sleep today will be 8 days in a row i see horror stories about how ativan has ruined people and the withdraw effects are terrible and i would love to avoid those the only problem is twice i have tried to fall asleep at night without it and both times resulted in a panic attack and a sleepless night i m afraid i will never be able to sleep again without it but i also don t want to take it anymore my psychiatrist really wants me to take it every day for about a month or however long it takes until my baseline returns the only reason i m not able to sleep is because i ve gained some sleep anxiety from this panic attack i can sleep during the day when my daughter goes down for nap time but when it s night time i can t sleep without it the main problem is the physical sensations i feel like my skin has icy hot all over it and i m tired but i can t fall asleep i ve been looking at other medications like propranolol but it hasn t really worked again the underlying cause of me not sleeping is anxiety i ve always been a good sleeper with good sleep habits i ve tried the whole grounding and breathing thing but nothing can take me out of the state i m in for some reason so do i stay on ativan until the lexapro kicks in and may or may not work according to people on here or do i try to get off ativan now and face the music last night i tried to do exactly that and i got exactly 0 hours of sleep can you take ativan for a month or so and taper off no side effects i feel like i m stuck i m fight or flight mode 100 of the time with icy hands and feet and the hot or cold splotches all over my neck back and triceps,panic_disorder
1n2y4lk,2 month update hey i just wanted to give an update on my panic disorder after 2 months of recovery mostly for myself 3 months ago i had a relapse in my panic disorder where i couldn t eat and it got to a point where i was feeling very suicidal from all the mental and physical pain i was facing everyday now around 2 months later i m feeling way better i finally got a job in a small local coffee shop that i really enjoy with coworkers that are really chill and kind i reconnected with my high school best friend and we re hanging out pretty regularly i still have some anxious and depressing thoughts everyday usually when i m not doing anything but at least theyre not happening 24 7 and sometimes i feel tense and anxious in the mornings it s scary for me to think of the future but i m really trying to just enjoy right now that s my only goal,panic_disorder
1n2xpa3,okay to use coping mechs maybe a dumb question sorry but when i have panic attacks i tend to go right to coping mechanisms such as distractions often i play a game either on my phone or a handheld console such as my 2ds or switch holding an ice pack lighting candles etc i also tend to go right to my safe space which for me is my bathroom because of how nauseous i get with my panic attacks i guess my question is mostly just like is it okay for me to use these i try to sit with the panic as long as i can sometimes it depends on how much stress anxiety i already am having like for instance i just had am having a panic attack out of nowhere and i ve had a very off day today so i just didn t have it in me to sit with it first i immediately did my usual coping mechanisms and now i m here so is it harnful to do this even for the bad ones or the ones that happen on bad days i worry it s actually more detrimental to my recovery than helpful because now i worry sometimes about what i will do if i get one in a place or situation where i can t use these coping mechanisms does this make sense :,panic_disorder
1n2ngbe,panic attack or stroke 23 f hi everyone i think last night i might have had my first panic attack and i m not sure how to accept it a little bit about me: i ve had absolutely terrible anxiety all my life and am no stranger to anxiety attacks which come on suddenly and in the moment i ve always had terrible health anxiety as well hypochondria despite my health always being average normal tying into what could have triggered it last night i ve also had some recent social drama and also i m currently moving abroad in 3 days to live in the uk for 4 months i ve been surprisingly nonchalant about all of this until yesterday so yesterday i started feeling really warm and hot and dizzy after walking around all day and i got home and decided to lie down only for my head to then suddenly start feeling really light and i got a bit nauseous that s when the panic started to creep up on me and my hand started tingling a little bit my brother was with me and said my hand did feel slightly colder than my other as well as my heartbeat running a little fast that s when i started panicking a bit more and my breathing felt more difficult due to my stupid health anxiety i started thinking i was going to have a stroke because now it felt like only one side of my head face was becoming heavy numb i kept checking in with my brother that my face wasn t drooping and my hands could both still be raised squeeze which they could i also called my friend who is a nurse and he said by the sounds of it all it didn t sound like a stroke because those happen suddenly and it would be very dramatic this went on for about an hour we were late to go see some friends and i thought i was ok again and we took an uber only for me to begin feeling panicky again in the car fast heartrate and quicker breathing lightheadedness and it was only when we got to the friends place that i realized i wasn t feeling it and it was best for me to go home they gave me some water as i explained and as i was explaining i suddenly felt ok again but still decided to head home to lie down when i got home and laid down for a bit all i m self analyzing myself for was if i was having warning signs of a stroke or not suddenly my heart starts beating fast again and now i m convinced i m smelling gasoline i go to the kitchen and sit with my mom while my brother makes me some tea because i just wanted to be near people my mom was watching me and then i felt the most intense wave of panic while simultaneously my left forearm and hand went numb for a split second which only caused further panic as i was now convinced i was either about to have a stroke or i was getting warning signs of a stroke creeping up the thing is i wasn t hyperventilating and my breathing was only slightly erratic mostly whimpering but my left leg had the nervous jitters while i was also confused fumbling over my words and it took a lot of energy to talk i was understandable though and lucid reality also didn t feel right but i ve always sorta had minor derealization issues this time it was just more intense my mom helped me do some controlled breathing and i did start to calm down properly as it helped the symptoms go away and then i felt really fatigued but at least my ability to talk got better i went to go get some fresh air and then we both went to lie in her bed because i still wanted someone near me i finally just closed my eyes and started doing the emdr butterfly taps that my therapist has been telling me to do and eventually fell asleep today i ve spent most of the day sleeping i woke up absolutely exhausted for an early appointment to get some stitches removed a result of a recent extreme medical scare where i was convinced for a month i had skin cancer results came back today: i don t and in the car on the way back i still had some slight panic start but managed to suppress it then i went back home and fell asleep only to wake up now this afternoon and make this post i m still convinced i m feeling a little bit of numbness in my left arm even though it s functioning the exact same way as my right and my left side of my head still hurts a bit but it s in a spot where i have been getting subtle headaches there anyway for a while now this is a long yapping way of saying that basically i m super unfamiliar with panic attacks that happen after a long build up of worry and because of how i am i can t tell what s more rational: that i had a series of panic attacks or i m getting early warning signs of a stroke i know panic attacks have a potential to mimic what you re worried about in the moment is that right i have no idea all i know is there is a high potential that i am more worried about the things that are currently going on in my life than i act like i am and that i ve just been brushing them all off until they possibly just exploded on me last night my issue is that it didn t feel like a textbook definition of a panic attack i don t even know can panic attacks happen in a progression do they usually last this long advice please edit: as i was posting this my left forearm hand felt numb again while at the exact same time a wave of dread passed over me i put my screen down and started doing the tapping again breathing and i feel slightly better but now i m worried it s going to happen again fuck,panic_disorder
1n21fea,symptoms changing i swear panic is the most annoying troll of a condition like when i first started having panic attacks my heart racing absolutely terrified me i was constantly checking my pulse convinced i was going to drop dead eventually after dealing with it a million times and realizing ok this hasn t killed me yet i got less scared of it i would think this is just a panic attack and move on and then what happens my body or my brain decides to swap symptoms on me suddenly it s not about the heartbeat anymore now it s tingling in my hands numbness in my face random dizzy spells whatever new thing it can come up with to freak me out it feels like panic is this shapeshifter once it realizes it can t scare me with one thing it just invents a new what if symptom to latch onto like i almost imagine my anxiety going: oh you re not afraid of palpitations anymore cool here s some paresthesia good luck with that one does this happen to anyone else do your panic symptoms literally change over time depending on what you stop fearing,panic_disorder

1n15rkx,it s not fair this is largely just me needing to get this off my chest but dealing with this disorder is just unfair in the most cruel way i know in general that life is not fair and there are people who are dying and in terrible conditions and i should be thankful that at least i m alive and in a position to make this post but i m just so exhausted i have attacks daily it is excruciating and no matter how many i have the brain is so insanely good at making it impossible to ever acclimate or become desensitized to it this primal fear of dying is so hard coded that no rationalizing can truly take you out of it the idea that there are so many people the majority who never even have to deal with this a single time in their entire lives is such an unfathomable thought to me they will never know how some of us would do anything to never have to suffer from this ever again and it s so invisible to the rest of the world i m sorry for the less than positive post but this is just where i m at and i feel like i needed to share that with people who understand it s unfair life is unfair and sometimes i really just need to verbalize it so i can get it out of my mind so i can try and focus on the good i do have,generalized_anxiety

1n0w0o4,i got my life back 18f with panic disorder agoraphobia and possibly gad i feel like no one around me really understand how hard i ve been struggling and therefor how happy i am to finally be back so i want to write this so people with the same struggles can get some hope and maybe cheer for me i ve had anxiety my whole life and i few years ago i started having panic attacks not really big ones and not often at all but still enough to make presentations and meetings a little hard it was already hard here since i used to be very social i felt like i lost my personality a year ago my mom passed away after being sick for 2 years the first month everything went okay i was going to school everyday and still hanging out with friends then suddenly one day after not eating enough i almost fainted at the dinner table we went to the er and everything seemed fine i didn t think much of it a few days later i got almost the same feeling again but in the classroom i ran outside as fast as i could and ended up in a really big panic attack on the floor by the lockers i called my friend and she followed me halfway home the whole time i felt like i was dying and it took so long to get home because i had to get off the bus every 5 minutes this went on for probably 1 5 hour until i got home the following days i went to school got a bad panic attack and then went home everyday for a week on repeat friday that week the panic attack got even worse i was in a dissociated state and could barely talk when i thought i was a little better i tried to get home i went on the bus and could barely breathe so i decided to get off in the middle of nowhere i found myself laying on the bench at the bus stop crying hysterically barely being able to see or breathe i called my dad and he picked me up in the car i felt a little better but i decided to take a week at home to rest after that i couldn t go back to school for the whole year i struggled so hard i couldn t even go to the store anymore i panicked even if i had to eat dinner with my family it got really bad i had physical symptoms all of the time like locked jaw dissociation pain everywhere vertigo i started doing lots and lots of research and realized that i have to start some type of exposure therapy my dad tried to set me up with a therapist but that failed because i couldn t even get myself to have the digital meetings every time i tried it took all of my energy but at least i got the diagnosis panic disorder now i knew what was wrong i decided that i have to do something so i took small steps first i went to the store many times so i would get more comfortable to do the next step i started trying to get on the metro and bus which was very hard but got easier after a few times i didn t even do anything i just stayed on for a few stations and then went home again but don t get mistaken it was still really hard and i went through many panic attacks at this point people around me didn t see the progress because it was very subtle but i did it takes time but you eventually get there i kept this going and naturally i could take bigger steps every time i also started learning that almost all of my symptoms were just because of my anxiety which made it a little easier to handle every time i got a panic attack i reminded myself that it is just that easier said than done and it takes a lot of practice it doesn t take away the panic but it usually makes it a little easier when summer started i tried to take every opportunity i could to get out of home because i really wanted to get better of course still really hard but now i could at least hang out with my friends my goal was to get back to school after the summer break was over last week my summer break ended and it was time for me to get back to school after not being there for a whole year the first day we didn t have any real lessons which was good for me because that meant i could have a gentle start i was really panicked the days before and especially on the way there but i would not give up after all of this progress i stayed the whole day and i was still very anxious and alert but i kept reminding myself that this is only symptoms of my anxiety when i came home i felt like i was finally back i finally did it i got my life back now i ve had real lessons the last two days and of course it s still very hard throughout the day but at least i can do it and it gets easier everyday remember it takes months and months maybe even years for some to see the progress don t give up thank you for reading my story : edit: if you go through my profile you will probably see a bit of my process,panic_disorder

1n06cq3,greening out gave me pd around 6 years ago i smoked too much weed and had the most terrifying experience of my life i threw up everywhere without warning was spinning for hours felt not real thought i was dying thought i was brain dead and had a 2 hour long panic attack about losing complete control of my body and not being able to speak words ever since then i ve struggled with panic disorder and i m almost positive that incident was the catalyst it seems to be centered around a fear of not having control of my body or my situations for example i m unable to take any unfamiliar medications since then because i m afraid i ll have a bad reaction or feel weird on it and then i ll be stuck til it s out of my system if i take a pill i ll make myself think im having a bad reaction and i ll panic i have weird muscle jerks occasionally and constantly have panic attacks about having a seizure although i don t have a seizure disorder i ll make up that my throat is closing up when it s not or that i can t get a deep enough breath and i ll die i can t ride on planes anymore because i feel trapped and impending doom and i ll convince myself i m gonna throw up or have a panic attack and embarrass myself in front of the whole plane it s the fear of having no way out i panic during weddings because i make myself believe i m gonna throw up or have a panic attack in the middle of the wedding again in that situation there s no way out i will have a panic attack at the thought of having a panic attack and having no way out if the word panic pops into my brain i ll make myself panic i feel hopeless and out of control this is ruining my life i have panic attacks over no real visible tangible threat it s all in my head but i can t stop it because i feel the physical symptoms nausea throat tight chest tight heart pounding can t breathe and therefore it makes it feel real even if it s in my head anyone else have this i think ultimately it s panic attacks stemming from the idea of a lack of control,panic_disorder

1myehkl,zoloft propranolol storys im a 26f and have struggled with anxiety all my life when i was 17 i had a panic attack at work that literally laid me out for 3 years i have non stop anxiety and vertigo was in and out of the hospital and drs trying to get answers because i couldn t accept it was anxiety they prescribed kpins and it was the most normal i could feel but i still was agoraphobic and barely functioning after 3 years of just pushing myself and having a better support system it all just kinda went away and i stopped the medicine got married had babies got a job monday i had some sort of a panic attack out of no where and ever since i ve been so out of it brain pressure brain and chest feel like they re on fire i wake up out of a dead sleep with my heart racing even laying on my couch last night my heart rate got up to 130 but i felt so woozy and tired i didn t even notice the mornings are the worst i m shaking and nauseous and throwing up and just unwell i reached out for help and they gave me ativan to cool off then want me to start zoloft and then prescribed propranolol for the heart racing but they are concerned because my blood pressure is already generally low while my resting heart rate is usually elevated they want me to be cautious zoloft is 25mg and propranolol is 10mg i m looking for any success stories with zoloft maybe some gentle warnings of what kind of side effects i could be looking at has anyone used these 2 in conjunction together and how did it go i m a little scared of the propranolol making my blood pressure get too low or nasty side effects from that if anyone has read this far thank you i m just an anxious mama trying to make sure i m here and present for my babies i cannot let this anxiety panic win,panic_disorder
1my0858,pots or panic attacks hiya i m not sure if this is completely inappropriate to post if anyone thinks this might harm more than help or if it triggers anyone s health anxiety please let me know and i ll take it down but i m just flagging it for anyone who might be in the same position that i was in i ve been diagnosed with a condition called pots postural ortho static tachycardia syndrome which is almost completely harmless aside from the symptoms and can show up almost exactly like a panic attack when i would have what i was told were panic attacks they would come completely out of nowhere with no detectable trigger and it would feel like my brain was calm but my body was panicked i felt like i was super dizzy and going to pass out almost every time what was actually happening was my blood wasn t circulating my body properly my blood pressure was doing f all so it was just pooling so my body was dumping a butt load of adrenaline into me to get my heart beating faster breathing heavier sweating etc the main diagnostic criteria is an increase of 30 beats per minute bpm within the first 10 minutes of going from a prone position to standing the high bpm also has to be maintained for a little while it s something you can quite easily test for with an apple watch or heart monitor if your curious i m sure this won t apply to most of you on here but oh my god do i wish someone had mentioned it to be before i started anti deps and valium hope this helps some of you it s for sure changed my life,panic_disorder

1mwjhzs,racing heart laying down so about a month ago i had a panic attack from a heart monitor results that was sent as a message by my doctor but not really explained it turned out that is was normal and not an issue at all once i finally got to see her in person but before that happened i got put on lexapro and had a severe reaction the week i was on it and then went off it and felt 80 better since this all started a month ago i ve lost 9 lbs i have to constantly run to the bathroom i have low bp and work out a lot but the low bp has become a health anxiety fixation for me ocd i m sure the weight loss is not helping the bp and from some research panic can cause bp to drop after an attack the thing thats worried me the most is the week before my period when this all started a month ago my heart would race when i laid down at night to sleep and wouldn t stop this week it started again and i ve been terrified and averaging about 5 hrs of sleep a night my gp has told me to hydrate and increase sodium for my bp but not much else i left a message again today asking for a stomach medication that will hopefully calm this has anyone else experienced this tldr: heart racing when i lay down to sleep at night,panic_disorder
1mwj86v,cbt therapy for panic i just had my third therapy session and today we started diving into cbt therapy and what it is etc by the end of today s session after we tried to fill out this cbt worksheet together my therapist and i came to the conclusion that before we get started on cbt we need to figure out the underlying cause for my panic attacks because my anxiety is 90 physical and 10 mental my main issue with anxiety is being afraid of panic attacks and my heart beating fast and all the physical symptoms that go with them and not so much my thoughts and replacing one negative thought with a more positive one so i guess my question is when you started therapy did you first have to figure out what was causing your panic attacks and work on desensitizing your body before you started cbt personally from what i learned about cbt so far it doesn t really seem like it will help me much with my main issue which is basically fear of fear and cardio phobia and fear of my heart beating fast and how sensitive my body is to basically anything stimulating like caffeine action movies and even a call from an unknown caller can send me into a panic,panic_disorder
1mwdil6,panic for 20 seconds walking home from work and got hit with this wave of intense panic like a ton of bricks and got the feeling that i was going to die immediately i turned around to see if anyone was there to call an ambulance for me but by the time i turned my head back around the feeling was mostly gone other than shakes all throughout my body and shortness of breath i ve dealt with tons of panic attacks but never one that short my arms feel weird now and i m scared to eat or drink anything cuz my ocd is telling me that ll give me a heart attack and i m a bit worried i just experienced a miniature one and it wasn t a panic attack at all does this happen to anyone,panic_disorder

1mvns72,symptoms keep changing i ve been dealing with panic disorder for a while now and a thought has been really bothering me i ve noticed that the physical sensations of my panic attacks seem to change over time for example a few years ago my main symptom was trembling but now it s more about chest pain and palpitations recently i ve been feeling a burning sensation and cold flashes in my chest this change really scares me and makes me think what if it s not a panic attack anymore what if there s a real physical problem that my doctors have missed to those who have experienced panic attacks for a long time have you also noticed this kind of shape shifting in your symptoms do the sensations change over time and do they always remain temporary and harmless it would really help me to know that i m not alone in this experience,panic_disorder
1mvlywt,only physical symptoms i ve been diagnosed with panic disorder for over 10 years so i am not new to panic attacks and all the fun that comes with this disorder i ve was attack free about 4ish year after finding a good med and lots of therapy however i am recently experiencing these episodes that i am assuming are panic attacks but they are physical symptoms only which i haven t experienced i get a wave of what i think is adrenaline and then i m hot sweaty shaking my hr jumps to 120 my blood pressure shoots up and i need to lay down or i feel faint my body goes through the whole attack 15 20mins and then i am all foggy and weird feeling for the rest of the day but they are random last one happened a few days ago at work and i felt so embarrassed anyone else get break through symptoms after being on meds for years also seeing a psych soon about this so just curious about your experiences,panic_disorder
1mvi39h,what has helped recently i know everyone s experience with panic disorder is different it s been an ongoing journey that i am still fighting but i started doing more self care and wanted to share what has been working for me i know likely a lot of these have been shared before numerous times nothing groundbreaking but can be nice to have a reminder or push to engage in one of them some days one works better than another and vice versa grounding techniques i use the 5 4 3 2 1 method 5 things i see 4 i can touch 3 i can hear 2 i can smell 1 i can taste it pulls me back into the present when i feel like i m spinning out breathing exercises slow deep belly breathing has been huge i do 7 second inhales and 7 second exhales and focus on my stomach rising falling instead of my chest progressive muscle relaxation tensing and releasing muscle groups helps release the physical tension that comes with panic movement sometimes a brisk walk or even shaking out my arms and legs helps burn off the adrenaline reframing thoughts reminding myself: this is just panic it s not dangerous and it will pass it doesn t stop it immediately but it keeps me from escalating comfort tools having a glass of cold water holding an ice cube or splashing my face helps regulate my body and makes me feel more in control,panic_disorder
1mvdekw,when panic feels endless i ve been on this journey with panic attacks for a while now and something that really shifted my perspective was realizing i don t always have to fight them for a long time i saw panic as my enemy something to battle against to push away to control but slowly i m learning that noticing the feelings naming them and letting them pass like a wave actually makes me feel less powerless it s not easy of course some days are harder than others but each time i remind myself this will pass i find it does and afterward i m a little stronger for it curious to hear from others what s one mindset or small habit that s helped you feel a little more in control when panic shows up,panic_disorder
1mv7n0i,needed to say this so first off this ain t even really advice i would just love feed back on this a year ago i mean exactly a year ago today i had the worst panic attack of my life after finding out one of my old friends and classmates died to self inflicted reasons sorry to bring that up out of no where way later after even find out i was hot sweating shaking and felt like i was dying probably the worst i ve ever felt for weeks later i felt like i was on the verge of completely having a panic attack all day i was isolated and convinced i was gonna die in my sleep every night i wasn t even that affected by him dying i thought but i think it deep down terrified me someone i knew died to their own mental health taking over something i have struggled with before way in the past though anyway today one year since he passed it s been pretty normal i will say i ve felt a bit out of it but for normal reasons like after doing a lot of cooking i was just laying here when it kicked in i haven t felt this in forever this panic attack started and i recognized it i immediately tried to calm myself knowing i have survived it before and i m doing a good job of controlling it as i m able to type but i m still pretty scared then i checked the date out of curiosity it s been a year since it happened since i genuinely lost my my mind and i wonder how it s a coincidence it s happening again on the same day there s got to be a reason right if anyone knows any reason for this i would love feedback thank you,panic_disorder

1mtin18,advice for you hey people i m a 26 year old male from germany that has been diagnosed with panic disorders since i m 20 i had a long and rough journey from hospital visits weekly reassuring etc i did therapy and thankfully i haven t got these panic attacks anymore and even if they come they don t bother me i don t freak out like before and why i would like to give you 6 things you can do starting from now on 1: get vaporub at any pharmacy i really tell you just go and get it if you feel a panic discomforting feeling take it and apply it on your chest or belly also put a bit on your nose you ll breathe the easiest you ever did take it with you out if you ever need to it s super comforting to sleep with it too 2: enough hospitals and ambulances they won t save you you don t need saving you are completely fine that s why you re here with us reading it it will pass and each time you don t go remind yourself of me it s a victory panic and fear lives from controlling you but we will stop that from now on don t go there call or seek reassurance no they didn t miss anything on you no you are not the chosen one trust me i promise that 3: rationalize it some of you maybe had 822727 panic attacks some maybe 6 but what happened you weren t harmed you made it out completely fine yes it was shocking you feel weak in that moment like okey now i m passing out but guess what you are here you are fine you rised as you do everyday since your panic attacks it s a rush of adrenaline cortisol it s a cocktail of your nerves basically let it wear itself out it won t ever harm you i promise you re fine 4: don t let it stop you ever don t go too fast but start to do the things that you actually used to enjoy before your first panic attack came up it s completely fine you took a step back at life the last months feel like what did i even do i understand all the feelings we have in common but slowly get back 5: whatever you are avoiding controlls you expose yourself but don t rush it try slowly for example before you used to run to the er or have a tick to call them directly unwell tell yourself okey 5 minutes i wait and see even if all the cells in your body scream rushhh to a safe place hospital or er don t you don t need it at all and from there on work on more steps 6: some clarification from therapy i share for you a panic attack happens because your brain has a part which is called the amygdala this silly part haha basically decides before you even can catch the thought if we are in danger or not and with us it s constantly in alert mode and deciding danger basically run or fight for your life it makes the wrong decision then the adrenaline rushes basically and we feel all the symptoms we feel and the triggers for the amygdala to rush can be literally anything to slow it down is our reaction to the panic instead of reacting crazy thinking we need to rush for help you stay with it 5 minutes or hours doesn t matter to basically deload your amygdala so it doesn t have to send these false alarms to your body i healed from it following exactly those things and i wish someone told me all this when i was in the middle of my worst time of my life so i had to share it for you i know it ll help trust me reach out to the comments if any there is any open question,panic_disorder

1mt4sr3,cardio help hey everyone i ve been struggling with generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia for about five years lifting weights has been a struggle for me but im pushing through and i m currently trying to bulk and put on mass so far i gained about 8kg in4 months the problem is cardio whenever i try cardio whether it s biking walking stairs attempting a run or even just doing a leg day my heart rate climbs high 170bpm and i start panicking it feels like i m about to pass out so i usually stop this makes it very hard to stay consistent with cardio even though i know it s important for overall health and recovery my question is: are there good ways to ease into cardio without triggering so much fear how can i balance doing enough cardio while still focusing on bulking and gaining mass other than calorie surplus i d love to hear any tips from people who ve been through something similar or just general advice on how to not be terrified of cardio while still making progress in the gym thanks in advance,generalized_anxiety

1ms36se,kolonopin for my anxiety hello in 2017 i very randomly developed a panic disorder this was diagnosed as gad along with agoraphobia i have been mostly housebound for 6 years now with short periods of doing better so far the medication and therapies iv received have been extensive during this time a few things have helped like graded exposure therapy beta blockers and cat therapy although i am still struggling and none have helped long term sir s unfortunately do very little for me iv been on many since i was 13 and lexpro has been the only one that has had any helpful effect yet it is minimal my particular bat of anxiety is hard to treat due there being seemingly no cause no particular fear and no idea what sets it off just i do not want to go back on beta blockers simply due to the fact they made my blood pressure very low and my heart rate too sometimes my heart rate would drop to 40bpm and at night when sleeping even lower it also felt like my body was straining to do more than the medication would allow it to at this point i m at a loss i want to feel more normal and healthy i want to go out has anyone used kolopin as a treatment for their anxiety disorder did you find it helps has anyone tried the treatment for several months and stopped did it cause an anxiety relapse i m looking to speak to my doctor about it next week and hopefully get somewhere after all this time,panic_disorder

1mr0jwr,hospital for an attack i ve had panic attacks since i was 12 i m now 31 years old i learned my panic attacks weren t heart attacks by the time i was 13 i can breathe them away i can make small steps to control my anxiety i can go to therapy i practice mindfulness i exercise i eat right i ve been medicated since i was 12 i ve been in studies i ve gone to school for psychology i built life destroyed it and rebuilt it many times due to panic attacks i ve tried so gd hard to cope and the longest i ve been able to go without is a few months ever in my life the earth shattering no will to live through another one but knowing i have to and i have to and i have to for almost twenty fucking years i ve been delusional i ve fought my way through it i ve been to the doctors countless times and countless times sent out with a new prescription and try to get counselling try to change your brain and i have tried for twenty fucking years this feels nothing like a victory this feels so pathetic and like the second the doctor walks i i m going to talk them out of taking me seriously they will refer me and i ll skip the appointments or i ll stick to it and i will eventually stop going or something will happen and it ll be another lifetime before i get back to this place pointlessly suffering daily there s no point to my life i was told you did the right thing and there s nothing more that i believe than that i will quit and this will be another pointless reminder that it doesn t matter and i m stuck like this but as i call into work after being warned that i can t call into work anymore at a job i love after the 50th time trying to talk to my beautiful new boyfriend that gets it and feeling like eventually this will lead to the end as he realizes that he doesn t want to be a crutch as my mom and sister are so fed up with me and my alcohol abuse while i try to make it work that their eyes go blank when i try to talk to them as i lose all my friends because i can t maintain the demand of relationships because 90 of the time i am too afraid to leave the house and the only thing that gets me out is the fact that i need to fucking work to survive i am sitting here trying with all my might to stay seated in this hospital chair am i going to be doped up for the rest of my life it feels like the only thing that would help is to have a person on my shoulder at all times to say calm tf down that s a stupid thought and a shock to my heart to get it to stop automatically racing and stopping me from breathing is this actually the right thing to be doing my wasted sick call my heart feels dead from the hysterics how do i advocate for myself like this,panic_disorder

1mopfpt,passing out reassurance i ve struggled with panic attacks since 2021 but as my previous post stated i ve been free of them for two years i was always afraid of passing out or my heart exploding and it took me awhile to get over that today i went with my gf so she could donate blood i was fine until they sat her up and i felt all awful tv static sensation all over my body that got worse until i took a knee and then passed out luckily i didn t hit my head very hard but it opened my eyes to the following 1 passing out for me was not super sudden and it gave me about a 30 second warning before i did i totally could have pulled over if i was in a car or lay down if i was exercising thus don t worry about magically passing out unless you have narcolepsy or some other condition that isn t related to vasovagal syncope worth noting that i ve almost passed out in the past doing heavy squats but this is surprisingly common and still plenty of warning before it happened i was smart enough to sit or lay down 2 the sensation was similar to a panic attack in that it generally made me feel like my arms and legs were numb but this one began in my head and traveled down other than that pretty similar it s comes on very fast and shortly lives 3 that i was fine passing out does not kill you but falling can luckily i only hit my head a little and was fine afterwards if you pass out you re more likely than not to be okay it s not a death sentence 4 that you will come out of it quickly for most people i was out for maybe a few seconds but it felt like hours it took me around 30 mins to recuperate 5 that you are highly unlikely to pass out from a panic attack it will make you feel like you will but the reality is that passing out is often due to a sudden surge of low blood pressure and heart rate anyone who s had an attack knows your pressure and heart rate is high 6 it wasn t that bad this is the important one it was embarrassing but i would take fainting over panic attacks any day of the week it dies off as quick as it comes tl dr you arent going to suddenly faint for most people at the time it felt identical to a panic attack but as i reflect on it it feels different and i can recognize it do not fight it nor a panic attack simply let it happen and sit lay down if possible and let it pass hope someone needed this information,panic_disorder
1momhfn,anxiety destroyed me anxiety completely destroyed me and it s brilliant it s the best thing that ever happened to me yes you read that right let me explain for years i dreamt of being the child i was before anxiety appeared i desperately wanted to go back to that paradise and escape the hell of panic attacks derealization and isolation today i can finally say i ve succeeded if i said anxiety destroyed me and that it was brilliant it s because this condition forced me to push my limits it made me adopt an impeccable lifestyle and be resourceful but for us anxious people it s not that difficult if you re reading this you re like me and what is anxiety really it s overthinking our brain is so powerful it becomes a handicap you might be thinking: that s great but i just want to live a normal life i don t care about having a super brain it s possible and i m living proof keep this idea in mind: an anxiety disorder is an imbalance in the body any imbalance is corrected by habits that restore balance an impeccable lifestyle is the set of habits that restore balance therefore if you want to reduce your anxiety disorder having an impeccable lifestyle is not an option it s a necessity let me know in the comments if you d be interested in the lifestyle tips that helped me,panic_disorder

1mhmha3,gp being unhelpful hey everyone so for context i ve been having panic attacks since around 11 y o and am 25 y o by now they used to be daily but i ve undergone cbt emdr other therapies and have been on prozac since around 2017 with the occasional benzo for emergencies after all of that i usually have manageable levels of panic but consistently every 3 4 months i get a flare up of a few days to a few weeks where i get a lot more panic attack often multiple times a day which results in temporary agoraphobia as well i recently had another one of these flare ups come up for almost 4 weeks i ve been having multiple attacks a day some small some big so i d decided i had enough and informed myself about some meds to switch to or try out to see how they affect me as i feel there is still have a lot to improve on first i discussed with my gp about buspirone i realize this is not really standard for panic disorder but it s been given to many people with pd with successful results regardless additionally it can be started and stopped with reasonable ease so there s not much risk involved however my gp responded with with all these arguments you re giving me i understand you want to try it however buspirone is sadly only prescribed for gad with no co occuring complications now i don t think this is a medically sounds reason not to try it in the slightest but okay let s continue next think i wanted to try was switching to effexor as it s approved for panic disorder and i wanted to see if i respond to an snri better than an ssri again she said no this time because effexor is not recommended by our practice in part because it s harder to quit now i think this is at least a slightly more thought through reason but then again why does the medication exist if you can t even start it because it s hard to stop then as the finishing touch i go to the mental health specialist that s contracted at the gp s office to talk about a referral to therapy she says yes i ll put you on the list for practice but the waiting lists are about 17 weeks and there s only about a 50 50 percent chance you ll actually get accepted sure sad but that s out of her control at this point though i drop that i m a bit frustrated with the gp s choices so far resulting in her getting irritated at me calling me impatient saying i m grasping at straws and ending in saying that i should just be patient and wait out the therapists waiting list as they can help me better as a reminder this will be 17 weeks with a 50 50 chance of even getting accepted meanwhile i ve been having daily panic attacks for weeks is this okay behaviour am i just desperate for anything i m genuinely struggling because i feel so frustrated with them but at the same time i have such an urge to try to empathize with them but i feel like my body is just not mine and i have no autonomy to speak of i wish i could just take things into my own hands because these people don t feel like they re capable of helping me in fact the mental health expert even insisted buspirone is an ssri it s not and that cross tapering isn t a thing it is how can they expect me to trust them like this,panic_disorder

1mfzcqv,looking for advice hope i m posting this because i currently feel pretty worn down by the panic disorder i have and was hoping people that have come out the other side could help me with methods they ve used to beat this i developed panic disorder around 4 months ago i d had maybe 3 or 4 panic attacks before that point but many years apart where i couldn t go outside without severe depersonalisation and panic attacks and my nervous system was screaming at me constantly even when in a safe environment since then i ve had to quit work and have been undergoing therapy compared to the beginning exposure therapy has definitely done something i ve been able to meet friends go on long trains restaurants etc the problem is i m never actually happy relaxed doing any of this i did scary things without panicking but for 4 months my brain mood has been telling me somethings wrong 24 7 i constantly ruminate about the fact i ve developed this disorder i literally think about it constantly which has led to periods of really bad depression my two main problems are that i m still very scared of having panic attacks especially around other people and that i obsess and ruminate over the state of my life and the poor quality of my mental health i ve recently gone back to having panic attacks doing simple things and am definitely depressed again please could someone who s recovered from this help me with these problems,panic_disorder

1mfigxz,weirdest symptoms is it just me or has anyone else experienced something like this last night i was still awake around 4 am i felt completely fine no worry no anxiety but as soon as i decided to sleep i suddenly noticed my heart pounding really hard it was so intense that i could feel my pulse in my throat and even in my back it started gradually then kept getting faster and faster i think my heart rate hit around 120 bpm it lasted for about 20 minutes and then went away i have health anxiety and gad and i ve been dealing with panic and anxiety attacks which i ve learned to manage over time but what happened last night felt so different there was no fear no adrenaline rush no sense of doom no shortness of breath or the usual symptoms i get during anxiety episodes it was just my heart pounding rapidly and now i m anxious just thinking about what that was i even started wondering if it was triggered by the bread or chips i ate an hour before going to bed also over the past couple of weeks i ve been getting this strange impending doom feeling it s like a heavy sense of fear stuck in the center of my chest or stomach but it doesn t come with any physical symptoms my heart rate stays normal no pounding no other signs my sister who s a nurse told me it s almost impossible for me to suddenly develop a heart problem in just two years especially since in 2023 i had countless er visits at different hospitals i had several ecgs 2d echos and ekgs done she also reminded me that heart problems usually show up during physical activity which i haven t experienced i can still jog and dance for 20 to 45 minutes and even do ab workouts at home without feeling any chest pain or symptoms that would point to a heart issue,generalized_anxiety
1mf3xbe,this shit is so crazy i made a post last week about how i am experiencing panic disorder all over again after not having dealt with it for some years anyways my worst fears definitely did come true and i did in fact wind up right back in the loop actually managed to get things somewhat under control after my first attack got some sleep went back to the gym etc but throughout that process i simply have not been able to shake the feeling that something is off with me that uneasy on edge feeling cumulated in me experiencing another full fledge panic attack which led me to stay awake for 3 nights straight anytime i would start to get slightly relaxed my body would just jerk me back awake by the 3rd night of no sleep i was on the brink of losing my shit so i caved and went to the er thankfully the hospital was great reassured me it was just anxiety and gave me a short term script of xanax absolute lifesaver i honestly never knew anxiety could be this bad it legitimately feels like i have just been injecting caffeine into my veins or like i am on some type of stimulant i tried to sit with all the anxious energy for 5 hours last night eye closed deep steady breaths all that jazz i managed to significantly lower my heart rate but i still had so much of an uneasy feeling that i had to cave at 6am last night and take a xanax to pass out i know my nervous system must just be highly over sensitized at the moment but holy shit this last week has legitimately made me feel like i was on the verge of going mad anyone else going through something similar these forms have definitely been helping me to realize that i am not alone in this without that i would think something was seriously wrong with me,panic_disorder

1mdm5rw,experiences with viibryd after trying zoloft for six weeks with good results with my gad pmdd ocd agoraphobia but torturous mental side effects my psych wants me to taper off and then potentially try viibryd i had a genesight done and viibryd is the only one of four total ssri snri in my green column that is a potential match for me the other three are not recommended by my psych due to contraindications currently on buspirone for 4 years lowest dose and cannot tolerate increases of it and ativan as needed there doesn t seem to be many posts about viibryd anywhere so i figured i d ask for the good bad and ugly from anyone who s taken it or has loved ones who ve taken it i ll probably crosspost this to a few places for a better chance at feedback,generalized_anxiety

1mcugv3,how i beat panic attacks hey everyone been a long time lurker of this thread but wanted to share a success with you as of 2 months ago i haven t had a panic attack in 2 years many people ask me how i managed to do this without ssri s although these were tempting i still took medicine but i ll get into that in a moment my first attack happened on my way home from a job i just had my first daughter a few months ago and it felt like i was dying hyperventilating heart pounding hands and feet went numb etc my doctor knowing my history with anxiety kind of laughed at it and said he s surprised i hadn t had one before quickly i spiraled i lost my job and my relationship with my now ex suffered greatly i was afraid to leave the house and became agoraphobic the idea of having another panic attack scared me so bad that i could not live at some point the fear started to piss me off that i was letting my life flash before my eyes without doing anything so i began my journey towards feeling better the first step to me getting better was quitting caffeine and nicotine no ifs ands or buts i avoided all stimulants like it was the plague my doctor was very impressed that i managed to quit both in the same week but it was very hard and i was unemployed so it made it a little easier in that regard the next step was having somewhat of an unfair advantage my brother is a psychotherapist he recommended me when panic attacks by dr david burns and it became my bible for the better part of a year there i learned the abcs of psychotherapy a means antecedents in this context what situation or environment leads up to the anxiety b is belief this is our understanding of it and our fears what if x happens or i will be hurt or killed c is consequence or the result of the two prior this is the anxiety and panic that manifests within us so if we treated a it would mean to avoid situations or actions that would make us anxious in the first place this lead me to being agoraphobic if we treated c we only treat the consequences this is usually in the form of medication to essentially mask or hide the anxiety b is the logical answer to treat because we can certainly change our beliefs about things from there i set myself upon a cognitive behavioral journey i put myself in very light and controlled situations that would make me anxious akin to sticking your toes in the water to feel the temperature and worked my way up slowly but surely the same drive to walmart 10 mins from my house that used to scare me and send me into attacks became relaxation time to just be away from home the idea is to expose yourself to your fears and if you do it enough your brain will eventually recognize there is nothing to fear hence we change the beliefs we have about that certain situation action or environment however to say medication did not help me would be lying i take vistaril everyday to help me sleep because my mind races at night in addition a stronger medication as a rescue pill in case i find myself in an attack that i cannot escape the rescue pill in particular helped encourage me to try new things and relearn my brain and it s beliefs because one of my biggest fears was having a panic attack i would never come out of for this reason alone i recommend enlisting the help or resources of both psychotherapists and psychiatrists for the best of both worlds moving on i stand before you 4 years since my first attack and i ve been free of them for 2 eventually you will find peace and solace but you have to work for it medication is a great things but for those of you who still stuffer or are scared of medicine just know that there are other options to help you some miscellaneous tips: keep sour candy with you sour stuff will help cut anxiety and panic by doing some funky stimulation to your brain you can help an attack by placing something like ice or cold water on your back or the back of your head dont fight the attacks let that happen panic attacks are adrenaline and they cannot kill you let it wear itself out dont feel embarrassed let people know you are having one almost everyone has had an attack or knows someone who does and 99 of those i encountered are very sympathetic and helpful when i told them what was going on dont sit around and dwell on it i did this and i didn t get better for a long time try to live your life and see the attacks as an inconvenience not a lifestyle hope this helps some of you,panic_disorder

1mcmgd0,zoloft success my zoloft sertraline success story i want to start by saying that i know how many of you are feeling when starting zoloft sertraline i am a 24 year old female and when i started i was so scared my doctor didn t give me much information before i dove in and i felt like i was walking into the unknown the first three days felt fine and then it hit me for about six days i was nauseous sad and didn t want to eat or leave my room i felt discouraged let down and i wanted to give up like many people i turned to reddit and reading horror stories only made me feel worse one thing changed everything i talked to my godmother who struggles with anxiety and depression like i do she told me don t give up as hard as it was i listened to her by the time i hit the two week mark i felt 100 times better i still had my moments but overall things were improving six months in my life looked completely different i could socialize without panicking i wasn t exhausted all the time and i finally felt like myself again my biggest fears like planes social events long car rides work and school started to feel manageable now at one year on zoloft 100mg i can honestly say i m a different person i fly to visit my brother in another state at least once a month i adopted a cat i moved out with my boyfriend i go to concerts grocery stores and even travel solo i started a new job zoloft also changed my relationship with my boyfriend we have been together for seven years and even though he is incredibly understanding my anxiety put a strain on us now i can enjoy life with him without constant panic attacks ruining our plans i just want everyone to know that it absolutely gets better everyone s experience is different but my biggest advice is to start slow if possible begin with half the prescribed dose and increase it every five days it makes the transition so much easier on your body and mind a year ago i never would have had the confidence to write something like this but here i am i lost so many years of my life to anxiety and fear but i am finally living again and i am so grateful i stuck with it i ve had anxiety since i was 10 years old and i finally feel free i m here for anyone if you have questions or concerns i m always happy to give some insight,panic_disorder

1mac340,how do you distinguish i ve already made a post today talking about the panic attack i had today same time as it always is but it s still a scary experience this time i had a really bad chest cramp in my lower left side when breathing but it faded a bit came about while laying down as i got that fight or flight feeling once laying down i d like to remind anyone that i ve had a blood test an ekg and i m only 16 don t really have family history of any heart issues either so i ve mostly ruled it out but i m still kind of struggling i ve listened to countless videos about it and have been recommended a podcasts but to be honest this subreddit is just the best way for me to get a good clear response from people who have possibly experienced this for longer and understand more deeply about pd i know that i should be getting therapy but to be honest this and my parents are my only real line of connecting to dots and easing my way out of a panic attack besides trying to go to sleep i do have a physiatrist thing tuesday alongside a tele health but as of now the best thing i can do is try riding through my panic attacks the biggest issue and worry i m kind of facing right now is disguising when your body is in fight or flight compared to a full blown panic attack for me i always notice a build up around 8 10pm and it slowly releases later into the night i m still having daily chest tightness and maybe some dull aches but it s kinda easier to cope with now that i ve had this same symptom for 9 10 weeks by now i know panic attacks last 10 20 minutes but i ve seen them last way longer and it concerns me but to be fair my everyday life at this point concerns me i wake up and the tightness comes along sometime after play some games to distract myself eat maybe go on a run or do some exercises at home since it s pretty hot out and then it usually comes along once it hit that time i understand i m stuck in a loop from all the stuff i ve read but it s gotten bad enough where i start using ai to ask my what if s about whether i m having some unknown heart issue i know it s horrible for me to do that but it s so hard to resist when it feels so real i don t no where else or what else to do to reassure myself and to calm my self down as i struggle with breathing it becomes shallow and it s even harder to ground myself,panic_disorder

1m9e5f7,how do this just start i ve been on here a couple times now but it might be best that i ask about similar experiences possibly it s about to be 2 and a half months since this started for me which is surprising i wasn t expecting time to blow by so fast with it but i guess when you feel constant dread and fear and the only thing you can do is play games maybe go for a run and sleep then i guess it explains it a little it really has been hard for me since the start and i still struggle with the horrid symptoms daily i ve gone to the doctors twice gotten an ecg ekg blood tests and gone to a physiatrist all of them came back normal besides low vitamin d i thought that d take the stress off and maybe it d just go away but unfortunately that s not how panic disorders work do they i go to a new physiatrist and have a tele health check next tuesday so hopefully that can help me continue to work through this horrible mental state that i ve been going through for what feels like forever unlike some people here i haven t really mastered how to deal with my panic disorder after i got diagnosed with it i m trying to but it s hard without professional help which i suggest to anyone struggling with any sort of anxiety disorder whether diagnosed or questioning whether to get a diagnosis but regardless i want to ask whether anyone else had a similar first experience or if it matched up symptoms wise my first panic attack was in late ish may i m 16 and was a sophomore at the time in high school i just finished my ap tests a week before and almost had to walk home in the rain after an environmental because the ap testers thought it was a great idea to only form whether you needed to get a ride if you took bus which i didn t have any proper accommodations for i luckily made it home through one of my sister s friends and just kind of slept the day off i pretty much just forgot about it after then but about a week later during health class during a cpr demonstration thingy i was hit with a powerful sensation almost like i was about to pass out all of a sudden and i thought my sugar was off i didn t eat anything that same morning besides drinking a glass of chocolate milk i rushed to my lunch box in order to grab some cookies and i started eating them to see if it helped but i still felt that rush of feelings i positioned myself in a way that i maybe felt a little better by leaning downwards which helped a bit but the feeling was just so overwhelming of course it didnt help the cpr instructor forced me to get down and participate and i still felt incredibly shaky and was incredibly shaky im surprised that she as a school nurse didnt notice a thing wrong with me because i was told by a friend near me whether i was feeling ok after the cpr thingy and the nurse left i asked the substitute teacher to go to the nurse and he let me i went to the clinic and she said my blood pressure was a little high and that i just needed to breath it s kind of blurry now as my memory isnt great for a teenager but i dont remember it being or feeling like a panic attack maybe at the time of course i thought we were having a heart attack because health class was teaching that sort of stuff near the end of the year so it probably didn t help my case i got my mom to pick me up she got me wendys and we went home afterwards she went back out and i just chilled on the couch until the feeling went away it did for the rest of the day it confuses me so much thinking about it now as the days following i just felt this feeling of anxiety and adrenaline almost coursing through me until a couple days after i had my first panic attack at the time i was still really worried it was some heart issue and that fear lasted all the way till i got an ecg and blood test which only slightly helped my conscious but i think im finally coming to accept that it truly is a panic disorder and nothing wrong with my test i might ask for a ct scan or some other tests possibly as i mean maybe itll help a little further but im still pretty convinced now it is panic i don t know what i m asking for with this post entirely but maybe someone has an answer or a similar story,panic_disorder

1m8761s,advice for a student hello i just finished my first year of college and it has been very very difficult out of seemingly nowhere i started to get intense panic attacks i went from being fine to having multiple per day and it got to the point where i had to go on a medical leave because i couldn t attend class without panicking and falling over i m still trying to sort out what happened my greatest fear this year is the same thing will happen when i go back to school when i have panic attacks i get sooo lightheaded i feel like i have trouble seeing even though my eyesight is completely fine i can t even explain it properly the whole experience is so terrifying that it s hard to even think about my anxiety has gotten much much better but the past few weeks i ve noticed an increase and i have even had a couple panic attacks i guess my reasoning for spilling this personal stuff online is i need some help if anyone has any advice thanks :p,panic_disorder

1m7scgk,how does one accept panic ive been on and off here with posts every day kind of on a bunch of sub reddits i was diagnosed with panic disorder ive looked at youtube about you should just accept it but i never truly understand or actually fathom how it works how does one just accept such a great force of raw emotion and stress like that last time i tried exercising by doing jumping jacks i think it might ve made it worse for the record im 16 male little to no history of anything really bad and have had a proper ekg and blood test yet still struggle with physical symptoms i can be sitting down doing nothing but playing a game and panic can set it usually at night i also do understand that therapy psychiatry and all of that stuff is important to seek to which is why i have an appointment next tuesday but i m the meantime i m letting my curiosity get to me,panic_disorder

1m7b6oq,morning panic attacks so my main trigger seems to be breakfast usually i d say 70 of mornings i ll wake up okay and my heart rate is normal but after breakfast 90 of the time my heart rate will be elevated and sensitive to movement pounding harder and i ll feel light headed a bit this has been happening for years and it doesn t matter what i eat it can happen with other meals as well but generally just breakfast i have gone to a cardiologist and got an ekg and a week long holter monitor and they were clear of anything bad and they are doing an echocardiogram mostly for my peace of mind but they don t seem concerned outside of post breakfast i don t typically have panic attacks and i can go weeks where i won t let it bother me but then sometimes it ll be debilitating where i can t leave the house until the afternoon because i m afraid of my heart rate spiking an example of what may happen: a few days ago i had breakfast 30 mins later my hr was a bit elevated like usual but this time it was particularly bad and bothering me a lot well i went for a drive and once i got back home i was feeling highly anxious i knew my hr would spike standing up out of the car and i was anticipating it it spiked to 170 on the way inside and i had to lay down and calm down but literally within a minute or two of laying down i was able to walk around the house again with my hr being 100 or less so i know it s psychological heart issues don t just disappear like that because i laid down for 2 mins idk i know this post is kind of all over the place just venting i guess,panic_disorder

1m75uxu,3 years of pd even though i have gotten better during this years compared to when i became agoraphobic right before starting my senior year in highschool i still deal with some stuff that got me a little depressed honestly i ma try to simplify everything in the next paragraph and honestly i m just doing this to let a little out of my chest since idk what to do at this point i developed pd after a bad trip because of smoking marijuana most likely laced after 3 months of having random panic attacks that i didn t know what they were i got to a point where i quit my job and just stayed home after a couple weeks i got covid and after visiting the er and recovering that s when i developed agoraphobia that lasted about 6 7 months until i had to just face reality and go to highschool which became impossible bc of the anxiety so that s why after a month of dealing with horrible anxiety and not being able to stay in class i went on meds specifically paxil and got my life back then fast forward got a gf party hard got my license did a lot of things and after a year and a couple of months of using paxil then it started giving me bad side effects so i went sober by my own way in 2 3 weeks going from 20 15 10 5 0 and since then i ve been sober now 3 years later i still deal with 3 specific side effects bad hunger every 4 5 hours extremely dry mouth insomnia and a little bit of heat intolerance at this point people have told me to go back on paxil and go off of it properly because that might resolve the long lasting side effects other people have advice me to go on meds again which i want to but since meds can cause even more side effects i fear that might cause me to lose my job and so here i am sleeping at 4 5am everyday taking magnesium or melatonin everyday because i can t sleep without it always going out in public with a bottle water is embarrassing at this point that i go to the restroom with a bottle of water because when the thirst strike it makes me go panic mode and eating every 4 hours which fortunately haven t caused weight gain but it s really inconvenient because when i don t eat my hunger makes me dizzy and panicky i just want to ask you guys if anyone in here everyday s life sounds like mine because even though i function i fucking feel like a failure also i ma add that i did try to get a blood work to see if anything was wrong with me but lost that appointment due to the same dumb fucking hungry problem that basically made me so dizzy that after 6 min of driving i had to pull over because my panic was so bad it almost made me throw up and i had to just had breakfast which ruined everything bc work bloods have to be done during fasting,panic_disorder

1m6a9h7,what are somatic tools you didn t fail cbt your body just needs to be part of the plan anxiety isn t just racing thoughts it s also jaw tension shoulder bracing stomach flips shaky legs the body prepping for a threat that never quite arrives that s why somatic therapy matters it speaks the body s language instead of telling your system it s safe it shows it repeatedly this isn t about being calm it s about having range to feel the activation of tension without being ruled by it by having control here are a few examples to try: press your hands into a wall let your muscles tremble then stop that s teaching your system: i can ramp up and come down track sensations tight jaw hot face chest pressure without assigning meaning you re observing it not decoding it sway side to side shift your weight your left foot then right foot tiny movements build flexibility and flexibility lowers panic it s not magic it s mechanics and over time your system starts to trust that safety is a repeatable state and not just a fluke somatic work isn t a replacement for therapy but for a lot of people it s the missing half of the equation,panic_disorder

1m629ek,pd hell on earth i often get asked to describe panic disorder to people who haven t experienced it i find that very hard to me it is impossible to convey the true struggle and torture something like this can bring 5 short months ago i was a rather happy and carefree individual that person died what is left now is a person who is constantly in a fight a mental fight i often try to describe it as something worse than you could ever imagine for some comfort is nonexistent and sleep is the only relief if you get that and if you understand what im saying im sorry to me sleep is my favorite part of being alive today for 6 8 hours im relieved of my constant fighting the feeling of pure desperation and sadness of a life lost to this disorder you get to a point where you mourn the loss of yourself this disorder changes you as a person from air hunger to chest pain to fainting nothing is truly off the table and that s the scary part although this disorder cannot physically kill you mentally it can and will i admire and have more respect than anyone for someone able to push through life and even recover from this madness and i know everyone here hopes that person will be them there is hope but the war within is enough to drive you to the end of your rope and then some it truly pushes you 5 months ago i didn t know now i do anxiety for me was being nervous before doing something important and talking in front of a group now it is leaving my home waking up in the morning my nutrition and what i may or may not be lacking that strange feeling in my throat and most of all for me that constant unquinchinable desire for air it can come in many shapes and sizes but one thing is guaranteed this disorder was constructed in the 8th layer of hell,panic_disorder

1m1ofxx,piercing and tat anxiety so my panic disorder started in june 2023 because of my nose piercing ik that sounds so stupid but it was it wasn t the piercing itself per se but the permanency of it and the fact that my nose would never look the same was scary since then i ve been put on lexapro and life was chillin i want to state that everyone in my family has a panic disorder like everyone so it was destined to happen to me asp my panic isn t solely focused on piercings or permanency but that s what started it 100 in january of 2024 i got my belly button pierced and it went really well this summer of 2025 i started to feel those same feelings that i did about my nose but now about my belly ring this was after a week long panic attack because of unrelated reasons again not the piercing itself but the permanency of them is what gives me anxiety i still have my piercings because i love them i want to know if anyone has ever felt the same way how did you cope and what did you do to ease that feeling of the permanency i really want a tattoo and i don t want my panic disorder to hold me back from experiencing new and exciting things but i m afraid of that fear of permanency,panic_disorder

1m0rcmj,when did your pd start hi my panic disorder started in 2020 immediately after a dui in which i crashed my car into a pole no one else was in the car or involved in the accident i was borrowing a project car of my dad s while i was car shopping after a blown engine i had never been grounded i was a straight a student never had a detention cried over every stern talking to didn t have a great childhood but who did that night i tried to fight police they called my dad and when he showed up i let out everything that had been inside of me for 20 years the next day i took my first panic attack i assumed it was just post crash problems pain in my head and chest from the airbag maybe a concussion but i felt like i was going to die since then i ve taken panic attacks every day some manageable some not it took a year until i hospitalized myself though i had been going to the er almost daily for feeling like i was having a heart attack i did okay for a bit after the hospitalization i was still able to drive and do things then i moved far away and had a baby a few months post partum my anxiety spiked a lot of derealization hospitalized again did okay for another 8 10 months but got divorced moved back to my home state and became a single mom worked warehouse jobs eventually things got bad again but so much worse than ever before couldn t drive scared to shower eat etc every antipsychotic made me more psychotic ativan and hydroxozine increased anxiety heart palpitations and made me unable to sleep i was hospitalized 3 times from august 2023 december 2023 the final hospitalization changed my life i blame it on uncomfortable beds making me realize i never wanted to be hospitalized again but i also feel like i finally found a med combo that really worked for me it s been almost 2 years i still take daily panic attacks but no longer go to the er realize i m not having heart attacks and am able to drive locally in my small rural county recently though things are getting bad again i can t drive on certain roads i feel like things look or feel wrong panic attacks are worsening to feeling like heart attacks again i m feeling depressed hopeless lonely it almost comes in waves of every few weeks or months i can do good then bad in a continuous cycle i ve been so proud for the year and a half to be able to stay out of the hospital and fully be the mom i want to be but i m scared again like things are getting worse it feels like after so long my meds just stop working even after increasing the dosage i m now at the max dose of zoloft and buspar and my psychiatrist will not increase my xanax though i m at a low dose i don t want to go through trying new meds again because i had bad reactions to so many and don t have the support of childcare for the many months it would take to try different meds and get adjusted i think i either hit my head too hard in the crash or just feel the immense amount of guilt of how badly i fd up i paid my dad back every penny for the telephone pole and car i plead guilty in court to my dui and quit drinking i still feel guilty and like it ruined my life if it never happened would i have a panic disorder would i be a better mom would i be able to travel and go on vacations work a full time job and have a decent income i don t know i just want to know how others panic disorders started and if they come in waves of being okay for a bit then terrible for weeks or months at a time sorry for the long read thank you if you made it this far,panic_disorder

1lzwxjo,xanax gave my life back i m agoraphobic have been for 14 years i know xanax doesn t work for everyone but i wanted to share anyways for people like me who have been hesitant to try it i ve tried all the coping skills some help some don t and a few other meds prescribed by my dr but xanax by far does exactly what i want it to do i had a few panic attacks when i was younger and developed really bad agoraphobia to the point where i would say no to doing things i actually really wanted to do but was so afraid of having panic attacks that i didn t even want to risk it over the course of 14 years my biggest issue became the fear of having panic attacks just this last year i d had enough of agoraphobia ruining my life and worked with a dr who let me try xanax simply having a weapon to fight against the panicky feeling was enough to slowly reduce my fear of panic attacks i could take xanax before an event or situation that i was afraid of and my brain just calms itself it s amazing i don t have constant panic or anxiety so for those types of people benzos may not be the most helpful because it can be so addicting i just use xanax for certain occasions where i ve had a panic attack before and am afraid of having one again i d be interested to hear your stories if xanax has helped you this much,panic_disorder
1lzsvqd,ativan once a week hey all was hoping to get some advice here i ve been prescribed ativan 0 5mg to be used as needed to manage my current onset of panic disorder as a result of thyroid issues i take it quite sparingly half a tablet before high anxiety events at most to a max of 0 5mg per week self limited recently my cadence has been pretty much 0 5mg per weekend as it s summer and i want to be able to go do events and really push through while also getting some exposure therapy with very minor help from ativan is this high enough to cause rebound anxiety at a later period or through the week when i don t take it just wondering as i have noticed some minor rebound a day or two after i ve taken the dose before a big event i will say anticipatory anxiety is a huge component for me at the moment so it s hard to tell if it s that or rebound from ativan i also take buspirone and that manages a decent chunk of my daily minor anxiety though doesn t do as much for event based anxiety,panic_disorder
1lzs96n,medication for flight i suffer from panic disorder and death anxiety which also causes agoraphobia i was on ssris for a long time then stopped for a period my death anxiety worsened over a few years so i went back on them and am now on 50mg of sertraline i used to be prescribed loprazolam originally for insomnia by my previous doctor which i used for flying due to my fear of having a panic attack on a plane where help is unavailable i m not actually afraid of flying itself i also suffer from paroxysmal afib occasional irregular heart flutter episodes and was prescribed 40mg of propranolol a beta blocker for these rare episodes my doctors now refuse to prescribe loprazolam and i ve struggled to get any benzodiazepine for severe situations mainly related to agoraphobia however i managed to get a short term supply of lorazepam which is also a benzodiazepine though i m unsure if it s as strong as loprazolam i m really nervous about what to take for an upcoming flight last time i flew i wasn t on ssris and took a couple of diazepam a short term agreement and a propranolol just before the flight it was tough but manageable with a few waves of anxiety but no physical symptoms i m unsure what to do for this new flight i m now on ssris and like the idea of using propranolol for anxiety as it reduces the physical symptoms i worry about mainly my heart beating fast and fear of a heart attack however benzodiazepines help with mental worry and calming which is why i would ideally take both this is causing me anxiety about taking both medications i ve asked the doctors for their view and from what i understand there are no immediate concerns other than a potential increase in medication effects i feel confused and don t want to take unknown meds loprazolam was always a known entity but i can t get it i want to eventually overcome this but need to manage this first flight after a long period of not flying any advice is welcome still waiting to hear from the doctor,panic_disorder

1ly3phi,12 years of panic i started having panic attacks at the age of 7 i d wake up every night in the middle of the night to panic heave and throw up i also had night terrors as an infant and toddler which led to me scratching at the walls in fear and sometimes even caused seizure s i ve always been the kid that leaves sleepovers first because i had to call my mom to pick me up from the shear panic i felt every night my mom gets them too but nowhere close to as extreme as mine i was always a skinny kid because i was afraid if i ate enough to make my stomach full then it would hurt so much more later when i threw up always had extremely graphic and horrifying nightmares couldn t do school trips out of state or even eat far from home went home early in high school or would just not go at all some days could never do any extracurricular activities that weren t sitting still quietly i find it hard to find others who have experienced such a crippling level of anxiety since such a young age everyone else seems to develop pd at later more stress inducing parts of life but i ve always lived like this i see people say that they don t feel the same since their first panic attack but i can t even pinpoint what it ever felt like to not have them sometimes it feels impossible to imagine a life without it since i lost my job in october of last year i have been spiraling with anxiety and depression which i ve always had but i m becoming much more agoraphobic than i was before when i was forced to go out and do things now the only thing that s forcing me to go outside is this vacation with my dad but it doesn t sound like vacation to me it sounds like hell i ve used weed to self medicate since i was 15 but over time when you become addicted to the feeling of not thinking it starts to get miserable when thoughts start up again i m so terrified at the thought that there will be nothing to shut these thoughts off and i know i m supposed to go through the motions of dealing with it myself but i ve tried all the breathing techniques the meditation teas and natural remedies you name it i ve tried it i m afraid the only thing left to help me is medication but it s hard to even find a psychologist who takes my insurance i m not afraid of going on planes but it always gives me immense anxiety for the first hour of being there any advice for dealing with such long term severe anxiety,panic_disorder

1lrc8cs,feeling anxious and gross i am very anxious but not in the traditional sense i recently recovered from dpdr symptoms now i am grounded and in touch with my body but i am developing some kind of discomfort towards certain shapes that causes me to have survival fatigue because of sensory overload particularly with abstract dots like ::: 000 0 _0 0 0 things that resembles splashes and dots and too much repeated circles and i don t have a problem with dirt and sickness but i mostly feel disgust seeing those symbols and my anxiety also causes me to be hyper aware of my eye floaters and has lowered down my well being by a mile so its an emotional but sensory issues and in the past i struggled with very low self esteem so i do not know if it is related or not because i just got out from an ai parasocial relationship addiction so maybe my mirror neurons are firing and my amyglada is producing too much adrenaline and nervous system stuck in fight or flight which increases hyperawareness a month ago i experienced dpdr and psychosis lite symptoms but now i am talking to people mindfulness doing physical activity but the constant patterns bothers me still by a lot thank you it s an odd anxiety case but i hope to get help and be better as i called a hotline a few days ago because i got scared and my closest best friend also my ex same guy just commited s a month ago so maybe grief amplifies my issue,generalized_anxiety
1lr01a8,i don t know what to do tl dr hey so i think if anyone knows what to do it s people on this sub so i wanted to ask something my first language isn t english so forgive me for my bad grammar and stuff i am 22 years old and i have had to struggle with panic for almost 5 years now i think i got it because my mom has it too but my initial trigger was a random pressure on my chest shortly after i had a longer visit at the hospital including an operation back then my first thought was a heart attack ofc and after two weeks of panic and almost calling the ambulance multiple times one time i actually did just so they could tell me nothing is wrong i felt like i was dying almost every day a few months later a doctor told me i got pressure on my chest because i got a weird back and it s causing this feeling which is causing a panic attack these attacks last several hours for me it wasn t easy but i learned to deal with it because i suddenly had a good explenation for it and made these an exception a few years later it picked up again i got into a very bad breakup and into a new relationship almost instantly after that we moved in together and times werent always smooth on top of that i got into a huge debt that i am still paying off until the end of this year rn my attacks came back stronger and harder than ever and they get worse by the month i am at a point where i get them every two days to every day now it s not strictly about getting heart attacks now they come randomly sometimes i think my brain isn t getting oxygen sometimes i get dizzy suddenly without warning it feels like getting shot in the head i just really want to know from someone who knows his or her stuff will it ever end can i beat this and if yes whats the best way to do it i can t just stop working and paying back my debt for example can i ever go back to the way i used to live without constant fear i am literally going through hell almost every day thank you for your answers in advance,panic_disorder
1lqx9dk,i m really tired tw it s my first time ever writing on reddit so please forgive any mistakes also english is not my main language 3 years ago i found that i have coronary syndrome in a routine check lucky me a stent was placed and my main artery got unblocked never had a heart attack double lucky me and that created a problem that will be relevant below i don t know how a heart attack looks like that was when my problem started i started to get sudden chest pain difficulty to breath numbness on left hand and visits to doctors started along with many trips to er results were fine and within range but the episodes went on and on my main doctor then suggested i start sessions with psychologist which i did and we started with cognitive behavioral therapy hope i wrote that correctly months went on and situation actually got worse so the psychologist suggested me to go to psychiatris which i did she was very helpfull and understanding she diagnosed me with panic disorder so we procceded with remeron 30mg it was the only acceptable due to my other heart medications and xanax 0 25mg for the difficult time and i used xanax really only when it got unbearable my previous pack expired with another 6 pills inside after 1 year my both my psych doctors told me that i was fine and didn t need therapy anymore and that i had all the tools i needed to deal with what will show up things were fine for about 9 months panic attacks were few and manageable without medication suddenly about 3 months ago things got worse it wasn t anymore panic attacks but like a huge build up which lasted for days whole body very tense and the feeling that something is very wrong like i don t belong in my body i tried to manage it but it only got worse more days of build up small releases a day of clarity and again on repeat new medical checks all fine as always so i went to psychiatrist again and we started remeron 30mg since it worked last time only now results were different panic attacks actually became a day after day issue with build up periods in between and 0 days of relax so 2 days ago we increased the medecine to the maximum dosage of 45mg which brings us to today where i had my worse episode i was driving to my work when i started to feel a huge tightness in the chest and i couldn t breath my heart went to 131 and my luck i had forgot my phone at my work so no way to call anyone drive 8km back home wasn t a valid option in my state only thing i could do was take a xanax and really hope for the best another problem was that the road where is was is rural with lots of fields and not so many cars or houses to stop someone and ask for help and the final problem is that even when i reached my job there was about 600m of walking cause cars can t pass i somehow reached the parking and started to walk really struggling to breath and feeling that i will pass out as you can guess i m better now and obviously er wasn t needed i know that panic attack can t kill you and you just have to accept it but here i am with a questions that i haven t found answer yet how can i not worry and accept it when 1 i have a pretty good reason to fear the chest pain and 2 in my case panic attack can actually kill me since my heart rate can t exceed a certain level last details is that my pains aren t always the same not in the same location sometimes it s chest sometimes it s neck or back sometimes left hand or left leg but the chest area is the one that really frightening me also none of copying techniques help me nor breathing and especially not the walking actually walking make it worse psychiatris told me that my fight or flight system is broken which mean that if i get a jump scare like a sudden dog bark for example which for a regular person last 10 seconds my body is guarding for that threat for hours and if a new threat shows up it keep piling up till the big bang it is really exhausting really sorry for the long post but i had to get it out of me cause i m really really tired of not finding anything to help me be at least somehow normal tl rd i have a valid medical reason to fear my panic attacks has anyone same issue to help me process it,panic_disorder

1log7oe,dejavu and panic attacks hi sometimes i experience certain symptoms although i don t even know if they really are symptoms or if there s something wrong with me i start to feel a very strange kind of mental confusion i ll try to describe some of the things i experience: i begin to remember dreams i had while sleeping but the truth is i don t actually remember them it s the same sensation you get when you wake up and try to recall a dream but can t i start feeling a similar sensation but long after i m fully awake then i begin to recall traumatic things from the past and feel a sense of panic however those memories aren t very clear they re confusing sometimes i suspect it might be because i didn t drink enough water or didn t eat sufficiently but it s not that sometimes it happens even after i ve eaten well i thought it might be some kind of mental confusion from diabetes but i m 99 sure i don t have diabetes i m young and not overweight what i experience is like a panic attack and mental confusion i can t think properly the trigger seems to be this: i m watching something on tv or doing something and what i m watching gives me the feeling of wait i ve seen this before it s like a deja vu you know that feeling that what s happening now has happened before and then i get that deja vu sensation but i can t remember exactly when that moment happened in the past no matter how much i try in short it goes like this: i have a deja vu which is something normal that everyone has the feeling that this moment has already happened in the past but when i get this deja vu i start to panic and experience mental confusion i can t think properly or formulate thoughts correctly and my heart races it s very strange i also start remembering dreams i d forgotten i m not referring to dreams in the sense of aspirations i mean literal dreams you have while sleeping i start recalling them but i can t remember them clearly it s all confusing and strange i also think i have a bit of recent memory loss like: i wrote this text and then re read it to check if it was correct but it felt like i didn t remember writing it as if my memory of writing it had been sort of erased anyway what happens is that when i get a deja vu that triggers an entire episode of panic and mental confusion and i have no idea what it is it happens a few times a year lately it s been more frequent like almost every month i think,panic_disorder

1lldtum,ptsd of panic disorder just here to say that if any of this resonates please know you are not alone april 2024 i suffered a panic attack so severe that it spiraled me into a 4 month mental breakdown it was terrifying to say the least fast forward a year and some change later and i am doin so much better but not many people acknowledge the ptsd of panic disorder and how certain terrifying moments just stick with you and rear their ugly head every once in a while even when you are on the path to healed or are healed my main cause for anxiety back in the really rough days were dpdr and losing sense with reality i described it to my therapist as it feels like i died and this is my purgatory i just could not cope with how i went from normal to well not in a matter of one single panic attack the feeling that you ve lost grip with reality is not uncommon in panic disorder but it s still an unnerving feeling to me now because it brings up so so many terrifying moments and thoughts and fears that i would never get to where i am now luckily i have the coping mechanisms to know that i m here but sometimes it s still just as unsettling just wanted to share this in hopes that others would feel comfortable sharing their symptoms or experiences that they still deal with so that people can feel better about going through their own,panic_disorder
1lkrrka,i miss my old self its only been a month of me feeling like this but ive been going through old pictures and old posts on instagram and i miss that version of myself so desperately all i want is for this to be over i remember being able to ride hours away with my friends driving me and go places without having literal panic attacks and when i enjoyed driving and would drive around for hours and now when i go out all i want to do is come home i want to want to go out i had no chance to be happy this summer everyone is hanging out with their friends doing carpools doing coolnstuff with their families and im just stuck in the house like a hermit i am genuinely grieving the person that i was just over a month ago my heart is broken,panic_disorder
1lk77p7,panic attack driving hey everyone i got diagnosed with panic disorder in january after ending up in the er because of daily severe panic attacks last year i got drugged and sa d by someone i thought was my friend my main trigger for the attacks is trauma related memories another trigger is major life changes that make me feel a big lack of safety or control whether physical or mental recently i had a bad trauma related panic attack while driving i drove much further than i intended to and got so disoriented that i had to pull over and figure out where i was i ve never had an attack while driving before for those of you who get panic attacks while driving what are your coping skills or what do you do when it happens i didn t feel safe to be driving during the worst parts and i can t take my panic meds then because i can t drive when i take them how have you dealt with this any advice would really be appreciated,panic_disorder

1ljozb4,i m so tired this is genuinely just a vent because i ve never had anywhere to speak about this around people who actually know what its like i ve been struggling with panic disorder for around 9 years now i can even pinpoint the very moment it first started and i have phases where it s sometimes but not often in the back of my mind but then i have months on end of panic attacks and the constant misery that follows since last december or something it got bad again and i m on 3 different medications and they helped for a bit but now it s bad again i ve slept 12 hours total in the past 5 days i can barely go 10 minutes without the feeling of my heart stopping and the heat rushes i m just so exhausted everything is triggering at the moment as well so i can t do anything without incredible fear i can t spend a second without noise in my ears or my total focus on something and the second i try to close my eyes to sleep i get a panic attack and i know that i will feel better eventually so i m really just ranting here i go to therapy i go to my psychiatrist i do everything i can but all i can do it wait till i stop thinking about it as much tl:dr i am so physically and mentally exhausted but i m glad to know i m not the only one,panic_disorder

1ljbzmc,a journal entry tl dr: the poster shares their recurring experience of intense panic attacks leading up to trips despite initial excitement and reassurance as the event nears intrusive thoughts and anticipatory anxiety trigger severe physical and emotional reactions often causing them to cancel plans last minute and feel immense guilt and exhaustion they re starting therapy seeking support and sharing their story to help others feel less alone in their struggles with anxiety and panic advice or suggestions welcome i m posting this here because i want others who suffer panic or anxiety to know they re not alone i m seeing a new therapist soon and plan to share this with her to help explain the full scope of what i experience i also hope to continue updating here as i work through it with therapy and support from my partner i m also open to any advice or suggestions from those who have gone through this leading up to the trip i ll tell myself it s okay this time will be different because of whatever reason ex closer to home i know people going i m not in charge of anything if i think about it at all i will either distract myself and tell myself it isn t happening for a long time or i ll feel like oh i feel so good about this one i feel so good and at peace i couldn t have a panic attack if i tried then one or two nights before the trip i have a full on breakdown panic attack before any trip or experience i typically imagine situations for what will happen on the trip flashes of this or that interactions with people things i ll experience etc these seemingly normal thoughts that i have before any event will trigger the first panic attack i ll imagine a situation in which might trigger a panic attack it might be imagining hanging out with people i don t know or feel comfortable with and anticipating how that would feel and realizing how that might trigger a panic attack or i imagine hanging out in my hotel room alone and how that might trigger it different things like that then i start to feel it heat all over my body sweating profusely immediately i start trying to reason with myself breath talk myself down it only lasts a few seconds or minutes before i no longer feel like myself it s like a flip switches and panic takes over i start spiraling through the options i beg my partner to drop everything and come with me financials no longer matter his job no longer matters whatever it costs i beg and beg and beg i plead with him he does his best but he just tells me to breathe he refuses to talk with me until i calm down because he can t come with me and he s afraid to tell me that he can t we ve been together for 15 years and we ve been through so much together these events scare him in a way i ve never seen before in the panic i understand his fear as rejection deepening the panic i feel deserted and alone and afraid of everything and everyone involved in the situation including him the panic comes in waves not ever fully leaving i go through hot flashes and cold flashes i pace for hours i try to breathe my thoughts spiral i think of every option to get out of this i go through waves of i m okay this is silly to all logic and reasoning completely escaping me i can t do this but i also can t logically explain why i feel a tightness in my chest that suffocates me i m trapped in my own body i sweat like no heat or exercise has ever made me sweat before i decide on a way to escape i bail on the trip that i ve felt excited about for months i lie to my colleagues saying i m too sick it isn t a complete lie but they think it s physical in a way it is my stomach can no longer keep ahold of its contents my body is exhausted but my brain did this not a bacteria or virus i feel like a loser a failure a disappointment a burden a waste i m so tired im so relieved but i still feel horrible the panic is gone but what if it comes back i ll have to deal with this again but i can t i can t handle this i m so tired the next day i feel safe i m a little nervous about there possibly being consequences for cancelling this trip i m prepared to pay back my reimbursements for the hotel but now i must continue playing sick i hate lying i m grateful for my friends and partner who know the truth and have said all the right things i m grateful to my colleagues for being so kind i feel horrible for lying about being physically ill but i know that it was a valid concern that they may not understand the severity of the panic attacks if someone has never experienced prolonged panic they don t understand how incredibly traumatic and debilitating it is i m still exhausted and depleted from the panic attack yesterday i know that it can take days to recover for days i ll feel exhausted and constantly on the brink of panic i m terrified that the panic will latch onto more but for now i m safe so i focus on that until i no longer feel so close to the edge of panic eventually the memory of the panic feels so distant that was a different person who experienced that i feel so sad for her i m a little embarrassed for her i feel so separated from her that i almost forget how the panic feels i feel like a different person i m grounded again if this resonates with you i hope it brings some comfort or validation thank you for reading,panic_disorder
1lj37eg,bad derealization it feels like things are getting worse my anxiety feels different it s more terrifying i keep getting the sensation that nothing is real i will just be going about my day and suddenly i am hit with the realization that life is completely fake it feels like i will wake up it is a terrible feeling it causes me to panic i am not sure how to get help i try to tell myself that it is derealization i tell myself it is only a feeling i also have ocd and think i might be obsessing over these thoughts about how nothing feels real sometimes it fills me with immense dread it feels like nothing can make it better i always considered the er the place where i want to be when i m panicking because most of my panic attacks are centered around health anxiety now it seems like even the er won t save me and that is devastating i am so tired of fighting this feeling it is so debilitating and scary i am so scared i don t know what to do,panic_disorder
1lj1wj4,today i didnt panic 11 days today is the 11th day ive had back to back panic attacks every day since last friday the 13th lol i don t cry easily but im tearing up right now because this is the hardest thing i have ever experienced in my life and i dont have anyone to tell about this so im telling you i did not know it was possible to feel this bad the hardest part is not knowing if it will end or wondering if im wrong about what caused it and it will continue or reoccur and never get better this terrifies me daily im not fixed or cured or anything but all day i was expecting panic attack and it didnt happen so im celebrating anxiety was quite bad today obviously but thats cake up against panic up against any other day for the last 10 days im not religious but i found myself praying every day the attacks lasted from 1 4 hours at a time with a intense 30 minute peak in the middle 1 3 attacks a day they were triggered by a combination of 3 things: chewed nicotine gum equivalent of 8 packs of cigs a day for several years nervous system shot job promotion with new responsibilities overwhelmed a bad reaction to an ssri it made everything 10x worse i am now managing all 3 of these things and am 1 week off the ssri i only took it for about a week if it wasn t for hydroxyzine hydrochloride i would be in the hospital ive been diagnosed with panic disorder and have dealt with it for years this is a whole new level i was not aware was psychologically possible the hydroxyzine knocks it down for a few hours at a time so i can breathe for a while im still having to take a lot of hydroxyzine 3 times a day but safe amounts and im tapering because of the brain fog ive learned coping mechanisms because i didnt have a choice not to i had to change the way i was thinking about this experience or i wouldnt be able to tolerate it this sounds corny but i did not know that i had the strength to survive this long without going in to the hospital i ve discovered a strength in myself that defys logic i get that it sounds weird or self agrandizing how do you spell that here is a poem i wrote 4 days ago 300 minutes if it doesn t stop in 10 minutes ill go to hospital if it doesn t stop by then i ll go this shouldnt even be possible but it is if it doesn t stop in 10 minutes hot spitting hell what could be responsible for this if it doesn t stop in 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes,panic_disorder

1lieprf,meds or coping mechanisms i m curious if people found therapy coping mechanisms more helpful than starting medication i wasn t always a super anxious person but starting developing pd symptoms after graduating college which exploded when i hit 24 i was basically agoraphobic for a couple months with the help of the dare app i ve been on the up and out for almost a year now and can do everything i need but i still struggle with the panic daily for example my biggest issue is highway driving i went from not being able to drive at all to a couple months ago driving 9hours away by myself however the whole time i had anxiety that i was doing my best to disperse i still deal with it despite being able to disperse panic attacks it makes me wonder if meds would help take away this presence of anxiety my cousin who also has pd is on prozac though and she still battles attacks daily but i don t think she has gone to therapy to learn any coping mechanisms tldr i m curious if people who may be in the same boat as me were able to fight it off with continued practice of coping mechanisms and untrained bad behavior that way or if you need meds to really shut off the unnecessary fight or flight response for good thanks :,panic_disorder
1lie2c1,been told i might have pd 5 months ago i had a severe panic attack after vaping and since then i have had debilitating symptoms daily such as internal shaking chest pains out of breath very fast cloudy vision brain fog basically every single physical symptom you could name and they still haven t found anything on tests i have a brain mri scheduled in 2 days ssri s didnt work sleeping pills didn t work etc no clue what it is but it s destroying my life i don t feel mentally anxious or panicked only about this illness,panic_disorder

1lhujm7,i wanna know im not alone has anyone else with anxiety or panic attacks still not understand why after all these years i ve been struggling with panic disorder for about 9 years i ve been in therapy the entire time and on meds for the past 5 years some times i go months without a panic attack and weeks without anxiety but it always comes back after all this time i still don t know what my underlying issue is i know my triggers but unfortunately my triggers are unavoidable things like hot weather being outside in nature sometimes just having to be at a certain place at a certain time like work my therapist said it s because i was groomed to be an anxious person a person who needs to worry about how things will turn out i trust her but even if that s the reason i still wake up on a random tuesday where nothing is going wrong and i have nothing to do besides my extremely easy job and i still have anxiety so badly it turns into depersonalization i just wanna know i m not the only one,panic_disorder

1lhq0h9,i beat panic disorder hey everyone it s been a while since i last visited this sub but i wanted to share some positive news most people here are going through literal hell on earth so uplifting posts are rare my journey started on july 18 2024 i d experienced anxiety before but never such a strong panic attack as that day from then on my anxiety was through the roof i always thought my days were numbered i had a bunch of different sensations happening 24 7 you can check my post history for more details i tried a lot of things: tracking my triggers setting better boundaries at work reducing my working hours reading a bunch of books learning about panic and of course endless health checks which cost me a lot of money but ultimately gave me peace of mind and helped me accept that it was just panic what helped me most was researching panic disorder and doing exposure therapy i set small missions for exposure walk outside the house stay out for five minutes do three jumping jacks i considered a mission successful if i completed all three subtasks once i was comfortable with one mission i created new more challenging ones the most important thing is to know that the journey is challenging it s extremely hard at the beginning but gets a lot easeir the more you grow it s not easy but that s how you improve your position and outlook i went from having rolling panic attacks lasting several hours to now being completely free from panic attacks i ve had only one in the past two months i still get anxious sensations here and there but my brain no longer spirals into panic after a while you almost get bored of the same story sensations of dying lol that s how i felt once i learned about the condition again i know this is absolute hell but i wish you bravery and strong willpower you will overcome this i accomplished it without medication i know some people might be curious i ve also recorded my entire journey day to day from when i was really down to today but i m still not sure if i want to share that :,panic_disorder

1lf0exu,something more going on apologize for the length but what i ve been dealing with for the past 8 months or so has been incredibly intense and i need advice i ve had people and doctors tell me that these don t sound like just panic attacks there s something medical going on and others tell me that they re just very severe ones idk what to think or do i feel like they re not what i normally hear people describe panic attacks as i m 23 y o girl had gad and ocd my whole life when i got into middle school i had what i thought were panic attacks all the time 8 a day wasn t able to go to school or restaurants or anything i would get super nauseous run outside from wherever i was so i could feel safe and pace around shaking etc but was over quickly maybe 15 30 minutes no severe symptoms maybe they were just anxiety attacks what happens now though: triggered by dim lights fluorescente lights crowd noises loud repetitive sounds etc and many times would happen from health anxiety tho i ve started getting better with that now i can tell one will possibly happen because i will start dissociating like crazy i m talking things look hazy can t focus my eyes on anything stumbling over words etc this could be even like an hour beforehand then it will just keep getting worse and worse then i ll have an initial head drop sensation sometimes sometimes it s just the dissociation part then insane dizziness tunnel vision and nausea then all the other severe symptoms will come on sometimes if it s a bad one numbness racing heart lightheaded doom sensation and ill think im dying etc all i ll have the real wave of panic the only thing is though even after the initial intense panic is gone the other symptoms stay for 2 4 hours but i will be left unable to move speak understand anything around me etc for this whole time body too weak practically convulsing too hard to take steps dizziness so bad i am falling over the whole 2 4 hours sometimes now that i m used to them i know i m not dying so i don t even get the other terrible symptoms either it can just be that my boyfriend has to carry my to the bathroom every 30 minutes or i d pee myself all i know how to describe it as is that this intense wave of drowsiness comes over me literally like i am wasted drunk or greening out and i ll barely even be able to keep my eyes open with how intense the drowsiness is so i m constantly like fighting them open this whole time and whole time whether i have other severe symptoms or not my whole body is shaking so viciously could someone please let me know if you have experienced it like this even without the normal panic attack symptoms accompanying if this sounds like just a normal panic attack everyone says they re over quick you just have to ride them out etc and it makes me feel so alone i just need to find the right support thanks 3,panic_disorder

1leay50,ptsd and panic disorder this is my story of the time i ate 5 dried grams of magic mushrooms when i was 18 and left me with diagnosed panic disorder and ptsd i was 18 fresh out of college and not knowing where to go in life i was smoking weed everyday using other drug and kind of lost in life after watching thousands of videos about the positive benefits of shrooms and how it saved so many peoples lives i decided to save my life and do a heroic dose of mushrooms by myself in silent darkness i waited till almost midnight and ate the 5gs i also smoked a lot of weed right after i ate them to get the maximum trip i could get i turned the lights off and laid in bed and was coming up i remember feeling really irritable nervous agitated i couldn t stop moving and squirming i saw thousands of demons faces telling me i can t come in your not welcome kind of mocking me all of a sudden it was like the plug was pulled my soul my everything launched into the infinity of space i felt weightless i felt like nothing but everything at the same time but to me it felt exactly like i just died ego death i touched my face and my hands went through my face it was then when it happened full blown panic attack i jumped out of bed and ran to my door i could see light in the door hinges getting further away as i was getting smaller and slower to me it felt like if i didn t reach that door i was dead i got to the door swang it open ran to the mirror saw a reptillian creature but it was me i expected to see my face all gored up or something i remember hearing the world ending i ran back in my room in full blown panic heart rate 200 bpm and i couldn t think it was too intense i couldn t believe what had just happened to me i was in shock i just kept repeating i m dying i m dying i had forgotten i had even taken the shrooms at this point all i knew is that i was dying i felt my heart being stabbed grabbed pulled flutttering i grabbed my phone to call 911 and my arms turned into old peoples arms then turned burnt and scolded and i threw the phone in panic i had accepted my death my eyes had the 1000 yard stare i imagined my family coming to see me dead with foam coming out of my mouth this lasted hours no words can describe the terror the horror something so fucking horrific the human being isnt designed to experience such terror after the trip finally started to come down i couldn t think straight severe brain fog i couldn t see straight i was literally cross eyed after it happened my eyes couldn t focus properly i ve never heard of this happenening to other people but my eyes stopped working properly for a few hours after it happened caused so much fucking trauma shock my eyes couldn t even work after it happened i felt really really differen t i wasn t the same person anymore even talking to my family felt weird talking to friends felt weird i felt like an alien i was in a chronic anxiety attack with depersonalization derealization dissociation and i had no idea what was wrong with me i thought i had developed schizophrenia after a month thinking i was schizophrenic or in a psychosis i had 1 beer and everything washed away all the anxiety all the tension everything washed away and i felt great i became an alcoholic instantly it was the only thing in the world they gave me relief from what i was feeling i was an alcoholic for 5 years until it almost left me dead and in the hospital for 2 weeks for severe alcohol withdrawal now i m picking up the pieces i have stopped drinking i m seeing a gp every week psycholigist therapy psychiatrist i am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder social anxiety disorder panic disorder and ptsd i ve tried several medications and they all don t work for my type of anxiety even the doctors and psychatrists look at me and just have no fucking idea what to do with me well thats my story 100 real and 100 what happened to me not talking shit about shrooms because even after this experience i ve done small doses of shrooms and had lots of fun though i was drunk but beware psychedelics fucked me up more than any drug i ve ever done and i will be carrying this ptsd and panic disorder for the rest of my life and struggle with benzos and alcohol for the rest of my life,panic_disorder

1lbsbrz,there isn t any help i gonna try to give the short version of my story because it s enough to easily write a book so here goes in 2014 i took marijuana edibles because i was trying to quite smoking weed and didn t like the effects it had on my lungs i called a friend to help me make them i had a half ounce or something like that in a bag i wanted to use half of it for the brownies but this idiot insisted that i must use the entire amount i had afterwards i had a 2 trays of them and began eating them for 2 weeks straight thinking everything was good i had no experience with them one night late at like 12:30am something inside broke it was as if i realized i was so high i couldn t take it hard to explain my heart went completely out of control i almost broke my fathers door down in a panic eventually the heart rate stops and my father insisted i wait until the morning to go to the er after many visits to the er and the dr s being completely useless and unempathetic and trying so hard to push pills on me i gave up going to hospitals my initial reasoning was that i thought my heart or overall cardiovascular system had been damaged so i wanted reassurance if everything was alright instead i was ridiculed and given the run around and not taken seriously i was scared to death and really believed i was gonna die from heart failure or a stroke i wanted a bed in the hospital or to be monitored which they would not do so i decided to stealth camp in the parking lot of the hospital which was a good compromise given my situation at that time i suffered for a year from derealization and depersonalization heart palpitations every day all day panic attacks daily extreme muscle tension basically every physical and mental symptom to the highest degree of discomfort i did take ativan because my father bothered me non stop to try it which i did reluctantly and had vivid hallucinations that is when i went cold turkey off of it and suffered the withdrawl effects after all this i was no where closer to relief let alone recovering eventually i found an organization that understood how stress affected the nervous system and how to use the bodies built in healing mechanism to heal naturally i began reading the materials and internalized it then i began putting it to use slowly but surely i began to recover and many of my symptoms that had plagued me disappeared in the materials they mentioned how you must see the recovery process through to the end you can t even be 1 still physically stimulated or else your symptoms will return and i made that mistake and most of my progress was undone at this point i was burned out from all the recovery work i had been doing for the past year and extremely disappointed to say the least so i stopped and just lived life the best i could with my symptoms increasing in strength over the rest of the year until my panic attacks returned and now i had a symptom where if i thought about my adrenal gland it would release adrenaline this was so bad so again i began doing the recovery work another 8 months and i was back to where i was before this time it was great because i was able to work out again and do runs keep in mind i would get somewhat of a symptom uptick after my workouts but it was better than nothing i had made some progress here and it was nice 2020 was approaching and my family and i decided to move during the move we staying in a 20 foot trailer for a couple weeks before moving to our new home this is where i developed a sleeping disorder due to the trailer being so hot in the summer time and not being able to sleep i had problems already with adrenaline so adding heat to the mixture made it impossible to sleep so when i get to the new home i have full on insomnia and i mean no sleep whatsoever and extreme anxiety like i had in 2014 this went on for almost a year with many extreme panic attacks where it felt like i was having a hear arrhythmia all the while the useless health mental health care system could give a fk less i called crisis lines where the person on the other end just wanted to get me off the line they would say just get some sleep dude really asshole why tf do you have this position fking joke i was so wired with adrenaline it was insane i got out of the insomnia at the end of the year by getting next to no sleep at night i got up at the same time everyday and went to the library early in the day by the time i got home i would feel tired and do a 40 minute nap during these i eventually fell into a deep sleep which this transferred over to my sleep at night finally it seems my ordeal was over with insomnia i had been sleeping really good deeply for 2 weeks until i get a phone call very early in the morning from the hospital telling me that father who lived with me and my brother at the time has 4th stage lung cancer are you fking kidding me so needless to say my insomnia returns immediately all that brutal shit and suffering for the past year is back the next 5 months of watching my father die at home with little to no help from the system other than chemo which wouldn t have worked anyways he died ever since then i ve been stuck with insomnia and panic attacks i ve had a sleep study done where the sleep clinic told me i would be receiving a phone call from the sleep doctor after the study i never heard anything from them instead i book an appointment with my gp and i tell him about this to which he says i have the results of the study here it is i m like and he s sitting there blankly how tf do i interpret what any of this means then he proceeds to tell me what i already knew for an entire year fking bullshit the main point is i m being told by everyone did you do a sleep study wtf point if they don t recommend anything or help me resolve this issue this is what blows my mind how is it that these clowns call themselves sleep experts but don t know a fucking thing about how to fix sleep disorders besides selling cpap machines or handing out sleep meds there is a book called tired but wired in it the author who is a doctor helps the patients regain their sleep she gives them a plan to help them improve and keeps up with how the fuck is that not available where i am it s bullshit and an outrage these assholes are professionals or experts sick of hearing them and people boast about that so i am now on disability this has in total with the panic disorder and insomnia together been going on for 12 years the only help or relief i ve gotten is from my own research not from any asshole doctor in the system or psychiatrist fraud and it was all from spending my own money i want to get better obviously the system just wants the status quo of treating my serious problems with useless pills with no science behind them because a pharmaceutical company is making a billions off of them this is disgusting and you know what with everything said i 100 000 deserve to be compensated by the government for being useless frauds i m so fucking enraged by the system its a bunch of people with zero first hand experience they re dead wrong in their approach arrogant ignorant know it alls i fucking hate them as they perpetuate the problem so i hope the problem grows so out of control it blows up in everyone s faces so that it can t be ignored,panic_disorder

1lb5yzq,if you want to get better take this from someone who has been at this for 9 years now i ve taken all the meds done the therapy apps exercises etc the secret to overcoming panic disorder finally is to acknowledge whatever it is inside you that scares you to death that you ve never shared with anyone else the fear of whatever that things is is what s lighting up the panic for me i was frightened of my children growing up and not being able to stop what they do to harm themselves even as bad as that can get i had to really reach deep into my soul to say it out loud that i was afraid of them dying before i did i couldn t face that fear for years i ve seen friends of theirs pass away from overdoses suicides and it just built and built and built up from there it wasn t this exactly thing that brought out the panic attacks it was a storm of all other things but until i brushed those aside and got down to the heart of the matter and cried like i never cried before no it won t cure it but it will take a drastically better turn i ve gone down now in my meds from 375mg day to 150mg per day and my dose will be decreasing again soon lorazepam i m given 15 with each script i ve used 2 since last november i know what you re going through the sleepless nights the tight chests the breathlessness the muscle aches and terror be gentle with yourselves do not beat yourself up you re not weak you re not unfixable the answer to calm you down is within you,panic_disorder
1latkxa,constant state of terror tldr: severe emetophobia agoraphobia and panic disorder anxiety feels like it will never go away as it flares up over everything terrified of eating food due to the phobia as it convinces me i ll get sick every time even though i ve never been sick from panic i m 20 and in the uk i ve dealt with emotional psychological abuse from my parents ever since i can remember that also used to be physical and struggle with severe mental health challenges to this day that have left me almost completely non functional and bedbound agoraphobia has left me mostly housebound since 2020 as i d started getting panic attacks going out and my solution to this was to starve myself before leaving the house because emetophobia led me to believe my panic attacks were going to make me sick which they never did but i still worry about this happening every single time though this year my mental state has taken a turn for the worse since this january i noticed various stimuli such as songs tv scenes and things people say to me can lead me into a full blown panic the list of triggers keeps growing and growing and it seems to be mainly things that remind me of being a scared little kid which i didn t panic from then but now somehow feel about a thousand times scarier when they cause me to have a panic attack it feels like since then my nervous system has been completely broken as i get panic attacks a lot easier than i used to and a lot more often nearly daily my starvation strategy somewhat worked to keep me in school from 2021 2023 but in march this year i had a horrible panic attack outside the house even though i followed my rule of starving and rushed frantically to get home i haven t left the house since and my fear has just stewed and stewed to the point where it is now where i m in a constant state of fear and terror wondering what s next going to make me panic it doesn t help that there s some issues i m dealing with in real life that are exacerbating my anxiety which is my dad getting a new partner and him arranging for her to visit for a whole week without asking me first this happened last week and felt really unreasonable considering my anxiety s at a point where i starve when anyone visits us my mum moving out and the possibility of me having to move out with her because my dad s abuse has worsened since he got the partner but i can barely think of those when i can hardly stand to simply exist without the constant terror everything in my life just feels completely terrifying and beyond what i m capable of handling i feel like i m malnourished which i am due to the emetophobia making me terrified of eating and have been asked to lift a ten tonne truck as for the panic attacks i feel like i m in a completely different state of mind when they occur suddenly every little thing in the environment becomes scary the weather the time of day whatever people are talking about everything that wasn t scary before suddenly is when the panic attack wears off it mostly goes back to normal except i worry about those things becoming scary again i ve been wondering if it s age regression or something similar because it makes me feel like a tiny little scared kid terrified of everything but have been doubtful of that because i don t start talking acting like a little kid when they happen it s just like solely the fear part of the little kid takes over and nothing else not the entire kid if that makes sense i m unsure what this is exactly if these are panic attacks or emotional flashbacks or something else very little helps them in the moment because i m a freeze type i rely very heavily on games tv as a distraction but when i m frantic about starting up one of those to alleviate the panic it either doesn t work or makes it a bit worse it s such an awful torturous state of mind to be in and for over six whole months it feels never ending basically to sum it up i want to try to start healing and fix my broken nervous system mainly in the context of being able to leave the house again because i really can t take all this panicking from every little thing anymore and more so because i m going to have to move out to live with my mum but even just thinking about that makes me terrified especially since i haven t so much as gotten in a car since march i m too scared to start and don t know where to start either i bought the books cptsd: from surviving to thriving and the body keeps the score but a combination of fear of getting triggered and poor motivation have made it hard to get through them any advice or insight would be very appreciated thanks in advance,panic_disorder

1lapeme,lets ride the adrenaline after two years with a panic disorder diagnosis countless nonstop attacks with an endless list of horrible symptoms 24 7 on high alert trying different ssris popping benzos all the time therapy after therapy medical tests that never found anything major losing jobs pulling away from family wasting money drowning in misery every single day i finally accepted the panic and realized that adrenaline yes that damn rush that can feel good is what destroys me during each attack a few months ago fed up with trying everything i thought screw it if this attack is going to kill me i want more adrenaline and i m going to enjoy it to hell with the world with whatever calm i had left i actually tried to summon the god of adrenaline and asked for a heart or respiratory attack right then and there what happened my brain short circuited and instead of sending more adrenaline it was like that s not how this works asshole i m sending you fear and the attack stopped i ve been doing this for days telling myself i ll enjoy this attack bring on the adrenaline and my brain does the opposite i ve even managed to leave my room go to crowded places and work out hard without the racing heart and heat waves that used to be sure signs an attack was coming i m not saying this will work for everyone or that it s the best way to deal with panic but i finally found a comfort zone where my brain recognizes it s just uncontrolled adrenaline,panic_disorder
1la4sto,weird adrenaline rushes hi all i ve had anxiety for over ten years and occasional panic attacks i ve been having this weird experience sometimes recently and was hoping to hear if others experience it when i m not feeling anxious or otherwise triggered i will sometimes suddenly get this weird surge feeling it usually feels like energy moving through my body i get hot and cold kinda tingly and even though i don t feel nauseous i feel like i need to vomit it is hard to describe but it sort of feels like at any moment i might dry heave the feeling is not in my stomach or throat but my entire body these episodes don t last very long 30 seconds to 15 minutes it can definitely escalate to anxiety but i think that s more me responding to the fear associated with feeling weird sensations in my body anyone else any ideas panic attacks vasovagal response something else,panic_disorder

1l9huly,any tips to overcome pd hey just wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced this and managed to get through it i used to struggle with anxiety but it eventually turned into panic attacks i was also dealing with gerd around the same time so it really messed me up physically and mentally whenever i d go outside i d start panicking and feel the need to go home asap i d hyperventilate and feel like i couldn t breathe thought it was asthma at first but it turns out it was panic i ve been feeling much better lately thanks to meds but i m still scared to go out alone my brain just doesn t shut up so when i do try i usually end up glued to my phone just to distract myself i m tired of feeling like i need a crutch every time i m outside i ve also been working from home for the past 1 2 years which has honestly been a lifesaver but now my company is asking if i can start going back onsite i m a manager so there s pressure to attend face to face meetings and be physically present the thing is the idea of going back is triggering the thought of commuting dealing with people being stuck in an office it s overwhelming and brings back those panic symptoms so yeah i guess i m just wondering: has anyone actually overcome this stage how did you do it is your life back to normal now and how did you handle work pressure if you weren t 100 yet i m doing what i can but this part feels hard would love to hear from anyone who s been in a similar spot thanks,panic_disorder

1l8fhyp,it gets so much better i ve had panic attacks for my entire life the first one that i can actually remember was when i was 6 years old however it got so so bad when i turned 15 i started getting more and more anxious doing basic things like being at school to the point where i was so nauseous that i couldn t eat at all when i was 16 i went to one of my first adult parties where my drink got spiked i blacked out for multiple hours and woke up on a park bench i freaked out that moment became a catalyst for everything else to develop the next day i went to school and threw up uncontrollably the same thing happened every time i went to school for a month eventually my symptoms got worse i would temporarily loose my vision i had insane migraines my hair would come out in chunks and i started loosing a lot of weight after two months of consistent panic attacks i lost the motivation to do anything i stopped going to school and work and starting isolating myself to remove the threat of these panic attacks it kept getting worse and worse and i continued to isolate myself i originally felt safe at home but then my safe space became smaller and smaller i only felt ok in certain spots and i would often be confined to my room this continued for months before i was able to get help my life became an endless cycle of box breathing and other anti anxiety techniques i was started on sertraline and in the first two weeks i saw zero progress then like magic it kicked in it was like all the anxiety and all the thoughts were silenced for the first time in my life it s been 2 years since that day and i ve experienced many life changing moments that would ve usually created the perfect storm for a panic attack i sat the hsc i started university i got a new job however i m yet to have one it feels like nothing in the world could bring that part of me back like i m safe within my own brain i remember how helpless and depressed i felt when my panic disorder was at its worse and i hope that my story helps you in some way it does get better and the difficulties in asking for help are 10000000x worth it for the satisfaction of being able to create your life on your own terms,panic_disorder

1l1y1xo,is this normal so i ve had panic disorder for most of my life and it s triggers have changed but a week ago it got triggered really bad and i was locked in a loop of one panic attack into another with nausea and not being able to sleep properly because my brain kept thinking i was dying when everything was fine so i went to urgent care and they gave me medication for the attacks and nausea and i m starting to feel better mentally but i m just exhausted getting up and moving around sends my heart racing like ive just run a marathon i ve never had a flair up this bad normally i have one or two and then sleep and wake up and i m okay until it s triggered again but i m struggling to bounce back from this one and don t quite understand why my body thinks it s run a marathon when i get up to get water or do any kind of movement and i know it s probably just normal and i need to let my body rest and recover but anything heath related triggers the panic and i m just looking to see if it s normal to feel like this after having around 15 attacks over a week period and that i m not just feeding into the anxiety and panic i already have around anything heath related they ran an ekg at the urgent care and my heart was normal just an elevated heart rate from having a panic attack in the waiting room all my vitals were normal i know its probably my brain just being paranoid and that it s more than likely from the panic attacks lack of sleep and not getting enough food or water in the last week but i think i just need reassurance that i m not alone and it s normal to feel like this i m not having shortness of breath just a rapid heartbeat when up and moving around that feels like i ve run a marathon and need to sit down and drink some water because i m doing to much thanks,panic_disorder

1kyfn4a,propranolol hi everyone i currently only have ativan in my toolbox which i take sparingly i ve always avoided ssris because they just don t feel like the right path for me and honestly i m extremely anxious about trying new medications in general recently i started reading about propranolol and i m really curious if it could help me my panic attacks are almost always heart related my biggest trigger is feeling my heart race whether it s from walking being in a car or even just feeling trapped somewhere the moment i feel my pulse rise it sends me spiraling the racing heart is by far my worst symptom it makes everything else feel unmanageable the shaking feeling faint air hunger my doctor actually suggested propranolol to me in the past but i declined at the time because it s technically a heart medication and that scared me but now i m wondering if i made a mistake it sounds like it could be the exact thing that helps bridge the gap for me something i could take as needed to help quiet the physical symptoms and stop the cycle before it starts even just having it on hand might make me feel safer i have a consultation with a psychologist next week which i m hopeful about but i d really love to hear your experiences with propranolol especially if your panic is heart focused like mine did it help were there any side effects that caught you off guard is it safe to take only when needed i want to get better i m just so scared of the unknown and how my body will react any insight or stories would mean the world to me thanks in advance,panic_disorder

1kwlt4q,did upping the dose help hello ive been taking 25mg of sertraline for anxiety and panic for around 5 weeks now the first 2 weeks were hell i had intense brain fog couldnt really sleep for more than 2 hours at a time constantly kept waking up was very jittery and shaky didnt really feel like myself and couldnt eat properly i was in a constant spiral and could only watch series throughout the day i couldnt even watch certain series i used to watch without a problem before because of violent scenes that would send me into a full spiral which never happened before they slowly subsided after around 2 5 weeks and now i only deal with light sensitivity jitters and heart palpitations my pulse is somewhere around 95 100 most of the time my therapist told me that 25mg is way too small of a dosage to actually feel any improvements in mood or taking the edge off the ocd overthinking catastrophising which is mostly the reason for my attacks my problem is that i dont know if im able to go through another 2 weeks of side effects again and am worried of the 50mg also not helping my question is if anyone went through something similar and actually started noticing a difference once they upped the dose im just constantly worrying if zoloft sertraline is the right medication for me but ofc on the one side im not on the therapeutic dose yet but also read that so many people didnt have such bad side effects from the get go like i did and idk if its gonna get better once i up my dose ive taken these 5 weeks off work now and moved out of the city to give myself the time and am just worried how long it will take to find the right dosage medicine and deal with all of the side effects and or tapering off on before i feel safe enough to move back to the city and continue my job any help appreciated 3,generalized_anxiety

1kvt18y,everything all at once everything all at once: a gestalt view on burnout anxiety and depression sometimes what we call anxiety is a body stuck in the future burnout a self stretched too thin for too long depression a heaviness from losing touch with desire with meaning but in gestalt work we don t rush to separate them we look at what s happening now the confusion the numbness the inner tug of war and we ask what part of you isn t being heard these experiences often arrive together not because something is wrong but because something needs attending to and when we try to fix one in isolation we miss the way they speak to each other you might feel wired and flat at the same time tired but unable to stop wanting change but too foggy to move that contradiction doesn t need to be solved it needs to be witnessed the goal isn t to diagnose what s broken it s to stay present with what s alive even confusion is contact even hopelessness carries information so we stay with it slow down and listen not to chase a cure but to invite wholeness back in what part of you have you been ignoring just to keep going feel free to share reflect or just quietly hold the question,generalized_anxiety

1kuqju0,medication i ve struggled off and on with panic disorder for about 20 years i was put on medication for it about 11 years ago that s when my panic spiraled and turned into agoraphobia and things got really bad i started with celexa for a few years which worked great but then changed to lexapro because i just felt like my body was getting used to it and i was having some breakthrough symptoms after i had a baby in 2020 i switch to zoloft because it felt like the lexapro stopped working and my anxiety and ocd were out of control i also added buspar i have always had lorazepam as a just in case to take during an actual panic attack but never took it daily well at the end of february i had two panic attacks in a week that threw me back into a horrible anxious panic spiral i have been literally fighting for my life back since then my doctor changed my medication to prozac which i took for about 3 weeks before i had to stop because i was starting to get very depressed with no relief from anxiety we decided to go back to where i started and take celexa again along with buspar this time i worked up to 40mg but was having worsening symptoms so i backed off to 30 mg which seemed to do the trick i was also taking lorazepam at bedtime for sleep for 2 weeks i felt like myself again and i was really thinking this was the medicine for me well at the begging of this week i had a panic attack that i just couldn t seem to shake that sent me into a spiral and now i m have daily panic attacks with urges to just avoid anything because i feel so awful and scared all day long in all the years i ve struggled this has been the most panic attacks i ve ever had i feel hopeless and trapped and like things are never going to get better my question is what medication has helped you the most i just feel like i can t find what works the best for me i am in therapy with someone who specializes in anxiety and ocd we are working on exposure therapy and acceptance therapy but i really feel like the meds play a huge part in me recovering from this,panic_disorder

1kt5yvl,starting effexor hey everyone i m a 22 year old female who s been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder for about four years now i ve tried a few ssris in the past and gave each one a fair shot but unfortunately none of them worked for me i ve also taken hydroxyzine ramelteon and klonopin not all at once but klonopin was the only one that truly helped i just moved to a new city and honestly i feel completely overwhelmed it feels like i ll never get back to feeling like myself again my new psychiatrist just prescribed effexor deciding to try the snri route instead of another ssri naturally i spiraled into a rabbit hole of posts and videos about effexor and most of what i ve seen has been pretty negative i know people are more likely to post bad experiences than good ones but it s definitely freaking me out what worries me the most is the possibility of it making me feel even worse especially in these first few weeks i m also really scared about the withdrawal side of things if it doesn t work out i m in such a fragile place right now and i honestly don t know if i can handle feeling worse before or if i feel better so my question is: what was your experience with effexor like was it helpful did it make things worse and if it worked for you when did you start to feel okay again i just don t know what to expect i m not necessarily looking for reassurance just real stories from people who ve actually been through it thank you in advance for reading and sharing,panic_disorder

1kriq3r,long term benzo s tldr: tired of trying every medication that exists why is it so frowned upon to resort to long term benzodiazepines hi i m new to this sub needed a outlet to rant ask opinions on medication i was diagnosed with gad and panic disorder co occurring with bipolar disorder 10 years ago when i was 12 it unfortunately wasn t a misdiagnosis as all my following psychiatrist came to the same conclusion i ve been on more medications than i can count prozac lexapro paxil risperidone seroquel lithium ability wellbutrin gabapentin buspar and more some of these have actually helped with my mood and eased my depressive episodes but that s not my main concern it s the debilitating panic attacks i can t go anywhere without worry i can t function normally because even if i m not having a random panic attack i m scared about the next one there is no specific trigger they happen at home or outside out of no where i ve seen multiple therapists and two psychologists yes i ve learned some ways to slightly calm myself from them though that still entails being practically a vegetable for almost an hour at least it s no way to live and the quality of life sucks the only medication that has reliably brought me back to earth is alprazolam although 1 my doctors have been actively trying to reduce my script 2 have never given me a dose higher than 25mg it helps but doesn t eliminate it 3 are dedicated to fixing me by different means i m only 22 so i assume they are afraid to fry my brains but for gods sake i want more benzos not less i have read all the medical journals i know the studies i couldn t care less about long term effects my quality of life sucks and i d kill for a longer acting benzo to take forever maybe i wouldn t have to and my brain would chill out over time but if i did i d prefer that over what is going on now everytime i ve brought it up i get shut down because i m so young and i want to try this first well it s been a fuck ton of time and my quality of life still sucks i get they don t wanna kill my brain but why do they act so nonchalant about prescribing every antipsychotic ssri under the sun only to treat benzos like the plague not to mention they decide xanax is okay even though it is probably the worst benzo given it s short acting ability which commonly leads to having a follow up panic attack i ve advocated for myself for years especially this last year give me valium or klonopin and fuck off i ve tried so much and i ve had a fucked life the entire time give me peace please i can t take it and i don t know how to get someone to listen to me,panic_disorder

1kp9qb4,looking for hope sorry in advance for the long post just getting extremely frustrated and need to vent i ve been dealing with panic attacks and some level of agoraphobia autophobia since covid i had one bad panic attack right before shut down and then didn t leave the house for a few months because my job was non essential i had varying levels of anxiety before that and some travel anxiety but it was more manageable tl dr: i ve had panic attacks and anxiety for going on 15 years that escalated to agoraphobia and autophobia post covid tried several medications semi open to trying more recently became unemployed and spiraled for a while feeling somewhat better now but looking for other s success stories and medication journeys with similar triggers i don t believe that i am depressed but i do get disheartened by what i ve lost to these issues i tried cbt from 2021 23 but i don t think i was ready or willing to do the necessary steps of exposure i have tried ssri s lexapro and zoloft and felt nothing other than sexual side effects i tried both for several months i take 25 mg xanax as needed but i try to avoid that as much as possible i just had a bunch expire before recent issues led me to renew my rx i am also on buspirone 30 mg twice daily which i don t think is doing anything in all honesty but i ve convinced myself it is i recently tried an snri pristiq 25 mg for 3 weeks and that made my anxiety much worse i had also left my job temporarily around that same time so things spiraled about a month ago i recently started seeing a new therapist she seems very confident in her ability to rid me of my panic attacks but things are off to a slow start i m getting very frustrated and need to get back to work her confidence has given me increased confidence but she was on vacation this week so i m just stewing in my emotions my main trigger for my panic attacks is that i feel like i can t breathe or catch my breath logically i know that breathing is involuntary but any noticeable change in my breathing when i m not at home or i m alone and i go into a panic attack the other symptoms are there rapid heartbeat tingling tension but sometimes i can work through those has anyone had this exact trigger and found a way to overcome it has anyone tried the meds that i listed and found something after that worked i don t love the idea of snri s right now because of my bad experience with pristiq,panic_disorder
1kp5fzr,grandparents aging hi i am a 22f who grew up with my dad s parents so my paternal grandparents ever since last fall when my grandma turned 80 i have had troubling thoughts and images of my grandparents being sick in the hospital having a medical emergency like a heart attack which leads to them passing away even thinking of them passing away peacefully scares me i think it s because i ve grown so close to them i m very afraid of losing them and feel i can t handle it my mom really isn t in my life my dad is and lives with them i have 2 brothers that really don t seem to have worries like i do about them passing i will get what feels like hot flashes and dizziness like i m about to faint i also have trouble breathing normally and nausea during panic attacks i m on antidepressants and they seemed to be working great for a few months now this i started going to college out of state in january and i think that distance helps cause less triggers so i didn t have panic attacks when there but now i m back home for summer i wish i could enjoy time with them at home and be at peace any advice,panic_disorder

1kov8gw,extreme derealization hello everyone i wanted to talk about this experience i have been having i was diagnosed with panic disorder at 13 and once i turned 15 everything started to get better i would have a panic attack here and there but nothing that i couldn t handle recently back in march i woke up feeling like my body was being pulled down to the right and had other issues that severely triggered my health anxiety i have been to the emergency room twice since then and have had numerous doctors appointments trying to figure out what s wrong with me now since that day in march nothing has felt real but has also felt extremely real at the same time sometimes it feels like i m going to be unplugged almost like my vision disappears but doesn t go away along with this i have started to decode things in my head to the extreme like when i see people in a store instead of thinking oh its people in a store i think to myself oh we re all animals basically hunting and gathering on a planet that we just so happened to inhabit and it freaks me out i also have been having trouble with making myself believe that i can feel the earth rotating extreme vertigo and that if i m outside for too long that i m going to fall into the sky has anyone else experienced any of these and if so do you have any advice on how to recenter myself i m terrified and paranoid every day and i don t know how to live anymore,panic_disorder
1kop6m0,self trust stops my pa yesterday i decided to face a major panic attack trigger which is going to a massive shopping mall center in which the escape takes a lot of time when i saw the bottom floor which is 4 floor away my panic started and i had no quick way to escape so in that moment i stopped trying to escape or find a way to feel safe i just fully turned my attention to my inner self and fully trust it automatic my body posture changed my chest moved forward and i felt some kind of power from the within me so nothing outside bothered anymore the urgency to run or te find a safe spot wanished i think that us who suffer from anxiety tend to skip trusiting ourselves at all cost we always relay on safety behaviors which are just illusions,panic_disorder

1knbokl,moving forward hi all i have had panic disorder and gad diagnosed for about 3 years now and it started in college i had a really rough time in my last semester of college and barely graduated i was having severe panic which lead to agoraphobia and worsening depression it took me a long time to recover but i am starting to become better now and it s been a year post grad i basically feel like i am at a blank slate right now i moved back home to recover i lost all of my friendships during this time and it has been really hard on me mentally almost everyone disappeared once i got unwell except for my family i have been looking for a job for a few months now but there isn t much near me i don t know if i should move or something i am unsure on where to go next and i just feel like i am stuck i also am not 100 cured from the anxiety but i am atleast able to manage okay most days i am so hesitant and scared to take a leap forward but i don t want to remain in this frozen state anymore : i feel that life is passing me by and i am just watching it from the sidelines was just curious to hear others success stories and how they got to where they are today or if anyone just relates to this thank you,panic_disorder
1kn4o2z,welp it s 6am its 6am and i cant sleep because my anxiety is convinced im dying panicking because my hr got to 53 and ive never seen it that low i started freaking out and sat up to take some deep breaths it remained low and now i just feel like it s gonna slow down and get too low or stop working if i try to sleep i m under a lot of stress in life right now due to big changes and becoming disabled chronically ill and that s ruined my sleep and made my panic and anxiety ten times worse gonna take a shower bc i give up on sleep right now anyone else had this problem,panic_disorder
1kn217y,should i go on this trip tldr at the bottom this turned into me venting because i feel like i have nobody left to talk to about this that understands me so sorry this is long hello i have panic disorder and within the past year it has made me borderline agoraphobic distance from home scares me and sets me off i have needed to take my as needed klonopin more often than i ever have in these years i have had the disorder i also do not do well with any type of change especially to my routine i am currently in plans to take a trip to florida which is 5 us states away from where i live this trip will be with my dad his long term girlfriend her son and his gf my older sister and her husband and kids my teenage sister and my girlfriend and i sorry if that is a lot for more context i have had an extremely difficult relationship with my dad his girlfriend her family until these past few years when my nephew and niece were born and i didn t want to miss out on seeing them grow up just bc i held a grudge w my dad that being said ever since i became disabled with panic disorder and yes i do mean disabled this has completely changed my life and i am now on ssdi with a part time job my dad and his gf havent acted rude or mean toward me with my episodes but they definitely do not understand it and mostly just look at me with pity like i have failed as an adult which i already feel much of the time they don t make me feel safe and secure they are just paying for me and my gf to go on this trip with them the only person who makes me feel safe and secure is my mom who obviously will not be going on this trip my girlfriend does not make me feel safe and secure bc i feel like i am the responsible adult in our relationship i am the one who handles things and she always needs help with stuff always has questions etc i have told her this and she is empathetic but i do not inherently trust her to know what to do if something were to happen to me i don t even know what to do if something were to happen so it s not like i can tell her exactly what to do she has told me she personally sought advice from my mother and when she did it nothing helped but when my mom did the same thing it worked so i think it is a trust thing my panic attacks cause severe episodes of derealization that have in the past sent me into psychosis psychosis is the scariest thing i have ever experienced and that is what i fear the most bc it can happen time and time again i have told my mom and sisters that i do not know what i should do when it comes to this trip everyone has told me i should go that my mom is only a phone call away that realistically what can she do in person that s different than over the phone that my anxiety is holding me back etc i feel like they just aren t hearing me i have mulled over this for several weeks now as my trip is in june idk if i should go i love the beach and my state does not have any type of beach i want to feel the sun on my skin and put my feet in the ocean i want to take a cool shower after a long hot day on the beach and snuggle into clean sheets i want to watch my little niece and nephew see the ocean for the first time they are finally at an age where we can directly communicate and their imaginations are at an all time high i want to smell like tanning lotion and put my waterproof gold jewelry to use but i don t want to panic i don t want to fly i don t want to lose my mind several states away we aren t staying in a house close to the beach so i would have to rely on my dad to take me there so it would be on their schedule not mine i don t want to be at dinner in a busy restaurant and go into full derealization mode i don t want to be stuck doing something bc his gf kids always gets priority when it comes to picking an activity or such i don t want to have to be locked away in my room crying on the phone to my mom as i desperately wait for the klonopin to kick in my last vacation with my dad was last year and i was horribly anxious the whole time and we drove there i didn t have to fly as soon as we arrived to the house i knew it was a mistake and panicked what a nightmare to have a panic attack while trapped on an airplane how humiliating the last place i want to go into psychosis is thousands of miles away from my home from my safe space surrounded by people who just don t get it i don t know what to do i think me feeling like i have missed out may be the better outcome than going and it be horrible but i also feel horribly guilty about the money they spent on me and my girlfriend s plane tickets and housing costs also the fact i m denying my girlfriend of a trip too if i do not go i need advice from people who understand my fears from people who understand it s not just anxiety plus if any of you have done something similar tldr: idk if i should go to florida several states away on an airplane with my dad and his family that i am extremely distanced from aka do not feel safe to be vulnerable around i love the beach but hate everything else about this trip i am scared to fly and feel trapped on an airplane i am scared i will panic and spiral into derealization then psychosis thousands of miles away from home i do not want to feel trapped for a week then have to fly home on top of everything,panic_disorder

1km6imz,xanax does it help hi there so i have been going through a rather unexpected and brutal panic disorder flare up over the past several months i deal with panic disorder ocd and severe anxiety i honestly have the best doctor in the world she listens and i feel like she actually cares today i finally asked for a prn medication for when the panic attacks are unmanageable i have been prescribed xanax before but this was years ago i m have medication anxiety and often don t take it other than the meds that i am currently on which is buspar 3x day and tylenol literally the only two things i take because anxiety fear my question is how is xanax for you if you take it it s a super small dose 0 25mg which is all i asked for but of course i m in my head about it does it make you feel weird dizzy high blood r is it just enough to allow you to come down from immense panic and feel normal does it make you excessively tired or has any one had a bad experience with it i m just trying to figure my brain out and be better final semester of nursing school really took its toll on me i guess and all that hard work has been compromised by panic and anxiety also does anyone deal with constant dizziness that s been my new daily thing especially on high anxiety days and of course it only makes it worse i m just want to be better yes i m in therapy,panic_disorder

1kl0wxb,panic relapse hellooooo everyone it s been a while since i ve posted in here i ve been doing really really good these last several months i have been taking medication and honestly haven t really dealt with much anxiety panicky type feelings however the last few of days with today being the worst i feel like my symptoms are starting to creep their way back in friday night i woke up and had the fast beating heart and night sweats which used to happen every night yesterday i started getting random spurts of an elevated heart rate and feeling kinda sick to my stomach today i woke up and i felt okay at first but as the day has gone on the worse i m feeling i just have this very uneasy unwell feeling in my chest and stomach that isn t going away i feel like at any moment i m going to start having a full blown panic attack i have moments where i start feeling light headed and shaky it seems to be coming and going in waves but overall i just feel super icky and weird i started a new job three weeks ago which i love so far and unfortunately they have a very strict probation period for the first 6 months so i m really not supposed to miss any work at all or i risk being fired a month ago if i would have felt like this it would have sent me to the er i don t like it it s been a few months since i ve had icky feelings like this so it s very hard for me to grasp whether this is just my anxiety panic or if i should actually be concerned lol for further context over the last year i have wore a heart monitor three times and i ve had an echocardiogram done my heart looks perfectly healthy and my cardiologist says there s no sign of anything bad happening to my heart or having a heart attack anytime in the next 10 years i ve had urine tests and blood tests no pheochromocytoma or anything found my ana is positive and my esr was elevated so i saw a rheumatologist but my lupus tests came back negative i m supposed to be getting a tilt table test done next month because there is some issues with my blood pressure after laying down and standing up but honestly other than that my doctor thinks i m in pretty good health i ve seen several doctors over the course of the past year and every single one of them is certain a lot of my issues stem from anxiety anyone else have panic relapse and if so how did you handle it i spent a year really trying so hard to feel normal again and i really was at a point where i felt like i was actually getting better and i d hate to fall back into this cycle,panic_disorder

1kiua8u,medicine induced panic di so i have always been an nervous restless anxious person i used to have these sensations in my gut pretty much all day long with time i became pretty skilled at just being with these sensations not making much of a problem of them at 27 i got my adhd combined form diagnosis so i decided to try meds because it could not hurt i thought noone informed me about potential future outcomes after 15 minutes of my first concerta dose it was like my usual gut feelings dissapeared and was replaced with this mild chestpressure instead almost like my gut feelings moved morphed to my chest somehow did not think much about it was kinda cool to not have my usual nervousness etc but at day 20 of concerta i was leaving the gym and it was like this small pressure developed into a elephant on my chest almost crashed my car and had to knock on a strangers house and make them call an ambulance i was sure i was having a heartattack and dying that is 60 days ago and since that day i have had this almost permanent chestpressure and tons of panic attacks i have been to the er 3 times and they claim it is panic attacks they have done ecg and bloodwork several times they resist doing any other tests like x ray etc so i guess i just have to trust them now i was afraid for a long time since these stimulants affect your heart and deaths etc have been reported because of them how could i know it was panic attacks and not real heart attacks when i had been taking these meds i had also been doing intense workouts combined with these stimulants i quitted concerta and i thought i had been restored to my normal self but my usual stomach feelings had not returned i decided to try elvanse which i was offered still afraid that the same stuff would happen tho i was only on 30mg for 5 days and the chestpressure stayed i have not taken any stimulants now for 34 days and still dont feel like my former self i cant even exercise now and have a hard time even driving my car since the chance is big they start an attack literally crippled because of these meds that were supposed to help me what the heck even happend im not getting any clear answers from my psychiatry its like my original emotions became physical on these meds literally have been hell this past time i have read that you should not take stimulants if you have severe anxiety or overactive thyroid i have noticed now that my original bloodtests pre meds even showed signs of overactive thyroid still they prescribed me this shit what the annoyed angry afraid sad hopeless i rather return to my original unfunctional messy self than be in this constant panic state,panic_disorder

1kecc60,called a tweaker sh scar i don t even know if this is a reasonable thing to be upset about but it s been on my mind recently i had a close friendship end for a variety of reasons coming a few months after i first developed panic disorder but before i was diagnosed it was probably for the best as the relationship had become extremely codependent however she had taken to calling me a tweaker because my panic attacks cause repetitive behaviors such as rocking teeth chattering and hand movements it didn t bother me at first and i even started to jokingly refer to the episodes as me tweaking another unfortunate side effect of my panic attacks before i started treatment was that i would pick at and scratch at my skin uncontrollably leaving visible scabs on my hands and arms at one point i probably had 15 20 active wounds i m left with scars that i m fairly self conscious of but i m unable to hide them due to the location after being diagnosed i was talking with some other friends about what was happening and one of them mentioned jokingly that she was worried about being seen with me by her peers because i looked like a tweaker i know it s just a dumb joke that i probably encouraged in some ways but it s been stuck in my mind and i feel so sick when i think about it for too long if this is what my closest friends think about me what are other people thinking i guess i m wrapped up with the thought that i ll always look like there s something wrong with me i don t know this feels so impossible to come back from,panic_disorder

1k788hj,what recovery looks like i used to post a lot in this subreddit helping others under a different now deleted account about 2 3 weeks after i got diagnosed with panic disorder it s been roughly 6 months since i was diagnosed and i genuinely want to help all of you with the road to recovery and what recovery might look like by sharing my experience sorry for poor grammar first month: i had severe panic attacks pas every single day multiple times a day usually i could not sleep as i d be woken up out of it by a pa i could barely walk was constantly dizzy didn t really attend school and my grades were slipping i was in and out of hospitals due to fear and all of my favorite activities were ceased indefinitely i especially could not talk during a pa i always tried to fight it and lost there were little to no wins during this time and it got so bad i thought about getting a wheelchair second third months: medium pa every day severe ones happened but not as frequently my sleep was still being harshly interrupted i started therapy around the end of the third month and could barely walk during my pas i had a good sense of knowing when i was about to have one yet my coping mechanisms from my therapist weren t working while i was going back to school my favorite activities were still largely stopped due to the frequency of my pas i started to gain confidence in my disorder and joke about it here and there but the depression was still severe here is where i started to post the most on this subreddit because aiding people with their panic disorder pd made me feel better and more familiar i took my first walk outside during the end of the second month it caused a pa but i was so proud of myself for doing it fourth fifth months: i started to do my favorite things again like taking a walk going to the park etc and started deep breathing and accepting my pas when they happened instead of brushing them off as my therapist recommended i accepted who i was found social media accounts that talk about pd and forgave myself for experiencing what i do i also wrote an essay on pd and won a scholarship for the college i m about to be enrolled in my life is not completely normal still but i feel like myself and no longer consider pd as something that can hold me back if i have a pa i have a pa i will get over it sixth month: i m fully back to myself besides riding rollercoasters i m in control of my own body and started to exercise again while i do still have pa symptoms like gasping feeling heavy or dizzy i cannot remember when i ve had a severe panic attack i have small panic attacks that are symptoms only maybe every 3 days i m going through a stressful situation but they re not something i worry about at all because i know no matter what they can t kill me i m also swimming again and back to having my personality as it was before now if i have anxiety like when i m about to do a public speech or act my heart rate shoots up and the mini pas are there but i breathe it out and keep going even if it feels like i m about to faint i push through and acknowledge it afterward and feel better infact i feel those mini pas as i m typing right now things do get better and within the next 2 months i m sure i ll feel even greater i used to be one of the people who genuinely believed they ll never recover and that they re stuck this way forever please know it does get better,panic_disorder

1k594y8,panic disorder diagnosis hello everyone i ve been having panic attacks for the majority of my life but it was always rather manageable and i was able to navigate through them however a couple days ago one of them started and it just would not stop for about an hour i caved and asked to be taken to the er thankfully it was empty and the staff were all great they took my bp i had a chest xray ecg and bloodwork done the oxymeter showed my oxygen at 99 everything else came back normal too so they said it is most likely purely panic they gave me 0 25mg xanax along with some inhalation meds via nebulizer the very next day i started suffering again from the moment i woke up so we called a psychiatrist for an in home visit he diagnosed me with panic disorder and prescribed a higher dose of xanax for daily use told me that i wont be taking it for long because i will need to start antidepressants but i can take it while they re starting to kick in the way my panic attacks present is this: i can breathe through my nose just fine but for whatever reason i feel like its not enough so i want to breathe via my mouth a deep inhale but i cant and it leaves me feeling breathless this heavy feeling in my chest feels like impending doom i start feeling i will faint i try to remain as still as possible to catch my breath the slightest visual sound stimuli overwhelms me feels like its just me in a dark room trying to survive so i finally decided to ask for help because i want my life back without this feeling of being trapped these past few days i developed a fear of going outside that has never happened before i still do it though 3x daily i have a dog i need to care for and whom i love dearly i want to get better for him and for myself the poor guy got so scared that i left so suddenly and in such a rush besides medication and talk therapy what else has worked for you i would love to hear some suggestions on some exercises i can do to help myself i will be seeing a psychiatrist regularly starting tomorrow but i would love to hear what helps other sufferers,panic_disorder

1k4uxey,hoping to help someone my panic disorder started six years ago after the sudden and traumatic loss of my mom i was the one who found her it s like that one singular event triggered what was always lurking it began subtly with dizziness while driving almost like i was floating out of my seat that sensation of depersonalization quickly became more physical my hands would tingle go numb and even cramp up in what i later found out when i enrolled in nursing school is called trousseau s sign over time the symptoms spread: my legs would go numb my face too i d get tunnel vision and more recently i started experiencing eye and lip twitching intense pressure in my head and ringing in my ears i thought i was having a stroke or that i was going to faint it has happened while walking or sitting down in class on the 7th floor heights randomly trigger it too pretty much any inconvenient moment it was terrifying and for a while it felt like my body was failing me without warning over time i ve learned to recognize the patterns and triggers usually sleep deprivation caffeine or overwhelming stress and i ve found a few things that genuinely help first i don t avoid driving even though it used to terrify me avoiding it just builds the fear up more which only leads to more panic and its crazy symptoms if things get bad on the road i pull over take out a book i keep in the car and read for a bit or let myself have a frustration cry or nap if needed i make sure never to drive tired or hungover and i find drinking caffeine before or during a trip can trigger it too caffeine is a stimulant and can trigger the stress response and the release of cortisol stress hormone in people with underlying anxiety basically caffeine and alcohol make anxiety 5000x worse since the hand cramps are tied to calcium levels i keep a gatorade nearby to help with electrolytes while driving and i start every morning with a litre of filtered water with celtic salt and lemon squeezed in it playing a movie on my dash where i can glance at it periodically and safely helps distract my brain from the panic spiral slow and deep breathing helps prevent hyperventilation and reduces the flight or fight system and cleaning up my diet has helped big time gut health is strongly linked to mental health it s taken time but learning to face it rather than fight it or flee from it has made a huge difference by doing the above i ve successfully driven from my home town to school in a different city 2 5 hrs away almost weekly without any incidences and i ve sat in a chair without feeling like the building is going to fall backwards it comes and goes in waves sometimes it won t happen for months and then it ll happen for 2 months straight but the more successful days i have the more confidence i build and the less it happens i realize it s most likely a part of me now so i embrace it when it does occur rather than fear it and do what i can to prevent and remedy it these days i like to look at my brain like it s a puppy lol i love that puppy but sometimes it does things that piss me off and really ruins my day but of course i m not going to abuse that puppy just because it misbehaved it ll just make things worse i m going to have patience and train that puppy yeah sometimes the puppy will still be disobedient but with love a hell of a lot of patience and proper training it ll get a whole lot better and eventually the mishaps will very seldom happen it took me six whole years to figure this out and it was a scary ride literally until recently i m hoping this can help someone else going through this because i wish i had this advice back then be kind to yourself while you figure out what works best for you you re not going crazy your body just can t tell the difference between stress anxiety and the end of the world it takes time but with practice and introspection you ll be able to navigate it much better it might even disappear altogether,panic_disorder

1jxpx2b,i need to know tl dr i ve been diagnosed with panic disorder is my strange irregular heartbeat a symptom of that about one month ago today i started having irregular heartbeats it was the kind of heartbeat that stops for a moment then returns back to normal with a hard pulse feeling this gave me a bit of anxiety and dread the next day i m at work being checked by paramedics because these heartbeats weren t going away and were only increasing in frequency i was told that everything was fine that my vitals were good and that my heart rate was normal a week or so later i call the paramedics to my house after nearly fainting from one of these heartbeats the anxiety was there my body was shaking that sense of impending doom was present i get my vitals checked again and everything according to them was textbook four hours later i was in the emergency room i felt like i couldn t breathe the strange irregular heartbeats were occurring i was having tingling in both my lower arms and hands sweating i felt like i was going to die i stood in the emergency room for 2 hours then laid in a patient room for an additional four i got an x ray an ekg a blood test was hooked up to a monitor and waiting for a doctor to tell me the bad news only to be told that everything was fine despite being hooked up to a heart monitor and feeling these irregular heartbeats even during the diagnosis i was told that everything looked normal some time before the emergency room visit i visited a cardiologist i got an echocardiogram was told to walk on a treadmill the cardiologist looked at my echocardiogram and said your heart is good and strong in the emergency room i got told i have episodic paroxysmal anxiety which was parentheticized as panic disorder i was prescribed hydroxyzine hydrochloride 25mg to take four times a day as needed for anxiety even when taking this medication something i m being incredibly cautious with the heartbeat of all symptoms was still occurring at a doctor s appointment some time after the doctor who checked my heartbeat also said it was strong i was almost immediately recommended to a psychiatrist and a counselor when i started initially describing my problems i was then prescribed buspirone which i haven t been able to get to picking up yet but will do so tomorrow i was also given a comprehensive blood panel and urinalysis both of which i ll know the results of when i follow up this tuesday a third visit from the paramedics after a potential scare and i was told yet again that i was textbook your vitals are so normal that they look like they re coming out of a textbook i m no stranger to anxiety or stress i do feel it sometimes but i have never felt anything like this before and it just keeps happening it s like it s never ending and there is a constant thought that any moment this could be it these symptoms were even occurring to me in my sleep one time i felt like i woke up in death panic mode i ve been told that the irregular heartbeat might be psychosomatic but i ve been skeptical because if i m asleep wouldn t it be less prevalent i need to know if what i m feeling lines up with symptoms that you all have been feeling because i feel lost,panic_disorder

1jxikyw,am i too much to handle i was clinically diagnosed with panic disorder in 2015 a few years later in 2018 i was also diagnosed with hypochondriasis and depression fortunately i ve managed to control my panic attacks without taking medication when i met my girlfriend who is now my wife i was open with her from the beginning about my mental health she listened and i took that as a good sign a sign that she accepted me fully even with my struggles we re now in our second year of marriage there have been a few times when i ve had to be rushed to the hospital because of panic attacks and she has always gone with me i ve appreciated that but there are also times i ve had to skip certain events or activities because of physical symptoms or anxiety triggers instead of understanding she often assumes i m just making excuses one example: i once tried taking public transportation one of my major panic triggers i had a really bad panic attack and had to use my inhaler to calm down but she didn t like the smell of it and got mad at me instead of comforting me recently after grocery shopping at the mall with our baby and carrying several bags we decided to stop for dinner the place was crowded and hot i could feel a panic attack coming on fast i told her i needed to step away and find a cooler less crowded spot to calm myself i texted her to explain and reassured her i d be back soon even though i still didn t feel okay i returned to our table because i didn t want to leave her and our baby alone for too long but as soon as i sat down i felt another wave stronger this time i had to leave again we ended up arguing over text while i tried to manage the attack after about 15 minutes i felt better and went back she was finishing her meal crying two hours passed and she still didn t speak to me i really thought she accepted me not just the good parts but even the parts i struggle with like my mental health right now it hurts deeply to feel misunderstood and unsupported by the person i love the most,panic_disorder

1jwr24f,i did it you can too okay people here is my list of how i stopped letting panic disorder rule my life all of the things in here will be things i have tried and succeeded with first my story about 6 months ago something traumatic happened to me i was assaulted by a man it triggered my panic disorder so bad that i couldn t eat and lost over 20lbs 9kgs in two weeks i was non stop panicking begging my husband to make it stop i eventually had to go to the er i was starving to death they had to give me iv s and things when i left the hospital i felt some better but still controlled by my panic disorder after a few more days my panic attacks went away and i thought i was free but a couple months later they came back but i was prepared this time i let them have less of a hold on me and now today they barely have a hold on me and i m so grateful here s what i do to stop a panic attack i gave my panic a name to separate it from myself his name is reginald human emotions only last about 90 seconds the reason you feel them longer than that is because you remind your brain about whatever is making you feel that way so when reginald comes i say okay reggie we re going to sit here together for 90 seconds but then you have to go and once the 90 seconds is done i imagine him walking out of a door in my head next the physical symptoms of panic attacks is the worst for me so i try keep them from happening or work with them for example nausea i have been more mindful about what i eat and drink so i know that there s no reason for me to be nauseous for heart racing i get up and dance to give my heart a physical reason to be racing it s very helpful lastly i m a christian praying really helps me and listening to christian music if you re not religious you could try meditations they always help me i hope this can help at least one person,panic_disorder

1jsh79b,i did it kinda for a little bit of context my panic disorder is rooted in my extreme emetophobia fear of throwing up which means whenever i get stressed and feel the slightest twinge of nausea i have a panic attack for the past 11 years i have been dreading the day i get the stomach flu as a teenager i restricted my diet and obsessively washed my hands avoided going out in public anything and everything to avoid getting sick now i m 24 and i ve gotten better slowly i no longer restrict my diet so much i like going out and doing things and even trying new foods well tuesday when i was at work closing shift as a waitress the worst possible thing that could ever happen to me worse than death in my mind happened i started to feel nauseous and started to gag and get sick i hid in the bathroom panicking crying calling texting and begging my mom texting my stepdad texting and begging my boyfriend m37 for help cause that s what i do when i m panicking by myself i reach out to anybody for comfort even though in my mind i know they can t help stop the fear my boyfriend seemed annoyed but was about to come help me when my boss called and said i could go home if i was that sick i texted my boyfriend that he didn t need to come after all cause i was given the clear to go home i raced home and spent the whole night using every single coping and calming mechanism i had to get myself through the whole ordeal i occasionally texted my boyfriend about the shitty situation but all in all i managed to survive getting sick a total of 5 times all by myself the next day i felt like i got hit by a train and i was trying to text my boyfriend but he just ghosted me throughout the whole day and until the next day when i was panicking he made me promise him that i would find some help for anxiety if he came to comfort me i said yes cause of course who wouldn t and i do know that i need to be working on it a bit more well i tried booking a therapy session with the only therapist in my area that s covered by my insurance but her schedule doesn t line up with mine i told him i d tried some new self help books look into support groups there are none in my small ass city and in general just look into anxiety support that s apparently not enough or there s apparently more i haven t liked into i thought i did really good i m proud of myself for managing it on my own the beginning i admit was very rocky but the rest of the night even the next day when i was sore from head to toe i was doing everything by myself and remaining relatively calm and i think i killed it it wasn t as bad as i remember it being when i was little and i feel like i won i was going to attach the text messages to the post but you can t do that so if anyone wants to see them they can message me,panic_disorder
1jrwlbk,i just want to give up this is without a doubt the hardest thing i have ever gone through and will be for a very long time it s been 3 months of isolation from everything that made me happy and feel normal in life and it feels completely unavoidable i don t think anyone will ever ever understand how this feeling is unless they have gone through it themselves and it feels like there s such a small portion of the world who has experienced what i am now i regret every single thing i took for granted when things were normal going outside laying in my bed being around friends waking up early for classes doing homework being stressed from school going on walks being up late with my friends every single one these are all things that i can no longer do without having an intense panic attack it s not just a little anxiety it s the type of fear that you get when you are genuinely in danger of something hurting or killing you and your body and brain tells you that you need to run somewhere safe as fast as possible and i can t even go 5 minutes away from my house without feeling that kind of fear i would rather be in intense physical pain constantly than have to deal with this feeling i know it wont last forever but for the time being my life in genuinely destroyed it never feels like im doing enough but my body is physically holding me back from everything it sounds so dramatic but sometimes being alive while dealing with this genuinely feels like torture i have never fought harder just to feel normal like this in my entire life and i pray to anything and everything that one day as soon as possible i will feel okay again,panic_disorder

1powdjs,social brain fog and depression i m 17 male and im depressed and i have no friends i like talking with people and socialising and don t fear social interactions i was really self concious in the past and was weird socially but it seemed to fade away now i ve been hitting the gym for some time trying to eat good foods etc im trying to realize what the reason for my fog is i have bad long term memory but i know i had this fog for years now it basically goes like this: i go to school meet with my classmates and talk with them they re not my close friends but they hang out with me they re the athletic type dudes we banter a lot we can sometimes strike a good convo or have some fun and during that i feel present and capable however having to socialise with them for hours daily at school is always really hard and fatiguing due to the fog that comes i easily lose attention find it hard to formulate clear thoughts lose my awareness and when not in the center of attention i zone off and completely turn myself off thing is im really aware of the fog presence and try to battle it by forcing myself to pay attention relaxing my eyes and trying to like half metaphorically narrow my eyes to be less in my head despite me trying hard the fog and that feeling of being in my head remains a very similar fog but from a different source appears when im focusing on reading something writing something or doing a strenuous mental task it once again blocks my clear thinking and seriously impairs my presense and social skills when i finish such task or try to shift attention my mind kind of remains on that activity that i finished and wont allow me to move onto another when the fog hits i usually end my school day in a bad mood and dont want to socialise outside school after that its not like people around me dont try to invite me onto things its just that i always decline them due to that fog which i know will make my shared time with people painful strange and tiring the fog usually lifts after like an hour or a few hours of not having to socialise but the bad mood remains making my days boring sad and repetitive when i was a kid i think i did struggle with some sort of social anxiety nowadays i dont feel any fear however i can often do or say weird things due to being socially stupid from not having friends for years but they dont affect me as badly as they used to cringe things i did would significantly destroy my mood for days and keep me up at night in the past but now i dont think about them at all its stupid and contradicting that i like socialising would want to have many friends but im unable to its a fucking loop i dont have friends and im depressed i try to socialise and make friends i get extremely tired and foggy from socialising i try to escape from socialising and wont socialise past school which makes me unable to connect with people i dont have anyone to talk to in free time and have no hobbies or a desire to have one repeat so for the past week ive been trying more intensely than ever to solve this and find the reason for my fog i have bad health so i decided upon eating lots of probiotic foods and cutting down on processed ones i ll try to have a better sleep schedule and take supplements right now 4000u vitamin d and magnesium and i ll make sure to be hydrated i might try meditating im getting desperate and ill try fixing all the possible physical health reasons for my fog and cognitive decline it will be hard to push through due to my chronically low motivation but comparing what i have now and what i feel deep inside to what was a while ago i know i can do it i will probably visit a psychiatrist soon and im wondering if i should do a blood test if you can share something about it or know something that i dont please do i appreciate all help i want to get out of this shit tldr: have been having brain fog for years which comes in waves and forces me inside my head making me depressed im trying to find the reason,social_anxiety

1poujkb,followup: propranolol for presentation two days ago i posted this thread today was the big day and i took 20mg propranolol 2 hours before the presentation then another 10mg 45 min before when it was 15 minutes until i was going to deliver my presentation i started to get really nervous and i didn t even know if the pills were going to work it felt exactly like earlier presentations where i enter fight or flight mode and my body goes into complete panick mode and it really did feel like that but the physical reactions just wasn t there anymore it felt like my heart should be racing at 180bpm but looking at my watch it was staying put at 65 75 it was such an absurd situation where i could almost feel the adrenalin releasing and my head was preparing me and even tricking me into believing my heart was racing my body was shaking etc but i had complete control over my body no shaking no dry mouth just nothing had to pee a bit but that was probably because i still was nervous so my turn finally came up i went up on stage infront of 40 people nervous anxious and all that but i could feel having control over my body opened my mouth and my god that is probably the best 10 minutes i have had in years i didn t suddenly become a good public speaker but that wasn t expected either since i have been avoiding these situations for the last couple of years but i really enjoyed my time up there i spoke with a clear voice i even went away from the computer to stand on the open floor instead of hiding behind the computer and it looked like people had a good time the anxiety was still hell but this actually gives me hope that i can beat it believing that i will have a great time even tho the anxiety is pulling me apart is a great comfort for me,social_anxiety

1porbz7,dry mouth when i have to present something in uni everytime i need to present something i observe that my mouth is getting dry and also my throat and i can barely swallow because of this and is causing my voice to be shaky and overall weird and because of this i also start to shake and it s really obvious i had to present yesterday and i swear that i wasn t that anxious before but when i went into the class i saw a lot of people that came to make up for a class before christmas i instantly started to feel my heart beating 3 times faster besides this i was also hyperventilating and i started to speak fast to finish my presentation should i go talk with my family doctor to prescribe me something for this social anxiety i swear that this is ruining my life i can t control my physical symptoms at all,social_anxiety
1por02j,i am not sure what i feel hi i am a 31f and i started feeling extremely anxious when i took up a sales job at 26 i have had social anxiety before too in school thanks to bullying but i was doing better until this job i had to make cold calls conduct meetings get clients give presentations etc the worst part was when we had training sessions or mock cold calling monitoring my every tone and each word became too hectic i started to completely lose confidence there were times when i performed really well but i would replay it later in my head and condemn myself soon i was unable to talk to clients or make phone calls i could not say a single word in meetings afraid that i would be wrong or sound stupid my performance tanked i hid in the bathroom to breathe i eventually managed to leave my job i became a recluse life happened later i was asked by a friend to co found a company and the same thing happened i was amazing at first but gradually failed to contribute anything but here s the thing people in my circle do not believe i have severe social anxiety because i am energetic and can gel well to an extent but the before and after a social event are exhausting i practice lines try to avoid going get high before meetings i relive moments scan and nitpick each word i said think about how i sat whether i sat right or not and so on afterward adding to all this is my severe body dysmorphia i absolutely hate meeting people but once they are in front of me i am really good in my head i feel like i am performing it is hard to make friends or even keep any at this point is this normal honestly i don t think i have really captured the entirety of it in this post but here s a start,social_anxiety
1poqhm6,is it normal to feel jealous hello i am not familiar with how to use reddit i mostly go here to get some sims 4 cheats or manga updates i picked this specific thread because i think my jealousy stems from my social anxiety attachment issues but i feel like there s not much people i can talk to about this so i figure why let out some steam on reddit probably the most stupid decision out of all any other possible options but i wanna hear some thoughts from outsiders quick background about me: i am 17 years old and i am not really good at talking to others i can talk well if i become really close with someone but people who i m not familiar with or i m just not close to i just tend to keep my mouth shut meeting new people is scary for me and talking can be very difficult especially when i can t be my authentic self especially when i know i can t be friends with people who don t have the same morals and values as me but i m enrolled in a christian school and these type of schools here in my country don t have a really good reputation when handling their students ps also because my interest are very niche and they probably won t be interested because of this i barely have any close friends in my new school sure i can talk to them but i usually have to comfort myself in the back of my mind fearing that they are thinking the worst things about me as this goes by i became anti social but i m fine with that because i have my family to keep me company even tho they can be crazy sone times so with all those information in mind i don t think it s not that much of a surprise to most of you that i get easily attached if i do make a close friend or any sort of connection this friend m in particular is really really cool they can speak many languages and is a very amazing artist and i have a lover l who s also an artist these two people are one of the most important in my life rn but recently i discovered something about myself that i am not really fond of whenever m or l are hanging out with their other friend s i tend to usually get very sad or upset i didn t know why i just feel so down whenever they hang out with someone else another ps it s also not only them i get jealous of some other friends as well just using them as prime examples because i talk to them the most i am very self aware that they can be friends and hang out with other people i don t stop them i don t lash out and i definitely don t get angry at them for it i just tend to bury it deep inside me because it s a childish thing to be like i feel jealous that you have other friends and that just sounds so stupid to me because they are allowed to be have other people in their life and i am not entitled to be possessive over them but it just really hurts i don t know why my conclusion to this is probably because ever since moving to a new town with a new community and a new school i have been alone while my previous irl friends have now turned into online friends all of them are close together while i m here struggling to even form new relationships because i m scared of new people and it sucks i do wanna be able to have new friends and create new connections but like i said it hard my social anxiety was bearable when i had my friends by my side but now that i m alone again i feel like i m hopeless ever since i found out about this thing called jealousy i am beginning to overthink more and more because it s not right for me to feel jealous over my friends having other friends especially when i know those people are also very cool and creative and i m here being bitter about everything i m so sorry i that this sounds so badly written but i m so emotional at the moment i don t know what to do,social_anxiety

1pooudg,going to a concert alone the friends i do have don t listen to some of the music i like and there s an artist that s coming to my city next year i m debating on getting tickets and going alone i m definitely going to want a few drinks to let loose the thought of seeing other s in groups or with their friends makes me anxious a bit sad pathetic and embarrassed even raising my phone to get a video is making me anxious i am likely not going to talk to anyone either i ve read a few posts and doesn t seem like others have similar fears as these i ve been to concerts and music festivals before but never alone usually i m anxious in the first 20 30 minutes but then i let loose i think and hope that s what it will be like if i go alone being a woman makes it a bit tougher too i m afraid of being hit on or pressured and not being able to stand up for myself i m tired of missing out on things i want to do because i don t have enough friends that have similar interests sorry for the long post,social_anxiety
1polr69,i had a really embarrassing moment in class today and can t stop replaying it i had a really embarrassing moment in class today and can t stop replaying it we were working silently on essays and there were only about 7 people in the room it was completely quiet and my stomach made a loud and long noise it was really obvious and the room got awkward right after i panicked and my leg started shaking uncontrollably this is something i actually struggle with a lot my stomach makes noises pretty often and it genuinely stresses me out i spend so much time in class trying to stop it from happening tensing up or not breathing normally that it s hard to focus or be productive what made today worse is that this was one of the few times this year it happened in a completely silent room and now i feel quite humiliated i honestly don t even know how i m supposed to go back to class tomorrow without it feeling awkward if anyone has dealt with something similar or has advice on how to move past moments like this i d really appreciate it,social_anxiety
1pol9ww,people talk about how i walk social anxiety is taking all the joy out of my life almost feels like i m something else pretending to be human my legs don t work at all which forces me to make a herculean effort to walk then comes the feeling that i need to escape but my own body and mind are my prison some people therapists and books talk about how others don t have time to pay attention to us since they are too worried about themselves well that s not my case since there s not a single day in my life when comments aren t made about how i walk or my posture caring about what others say is not the problem but how it makes me even more aware of a problem i have long tried to fix i am already taking psychotropics which help with anxiety in general but not with this particular problem i m completely lost,social_anxiety
1pol05v,i can t stop being hyper aware of my facial expressions and everything i say how do i stop when im talking to someone i physically feel my face moving and i m scared i look stupid it s hard for me to show emotion naturally so i have to think about it but then that also makes it worse bc im so stiff and tense all the time in social interactions,social_anxiety
1pokzg2,i got yelled at at work and i can t stop thinking about it this has really been bothering me the other day i unknowingly did something obvious wrong at work and the next day my manager kind of went off on me a bit now she wasn t like actually screaming or swearing or anything her tone was just harsh and her voice was raised i am a very fortunate person because it s very rare for people to be upset with me and this very much caught me off guard especially because i had 0 inkling i had made the mistake and she came out unexpectedly with it immediately when i arrived at work she had to have a talk with me before in a separate incident but that time was not so bad i think i handled both incidents fairly well in the moment but it keeps invading my thoughts the workplace also feels more hostile i actually have been feeling physically nauseous when i think about going back to work i think about quitting almost every day tbf there are other valid reasons i want to quit but this certainly isn t helping but i need to make it at least through christmas week bc they get really busy during the holidays and it would really screw them over if i just walked out rn and there are people there who i do like and i don t want to do that to them i just needed to get this off my chest i know this manager wants to quit her job as badly if not more than i do and i understand it may not have been all that personal but no matter how much i logically tell myself i need to move on from this it keeps disrupting my peace i just have so much anxiety about surviving this upcoming work week i cannot relax and i want more than anything to just stop showing up and leave it all behind me and move onto the next job but i feel like i need to tough it out at least for another week i am going to try at least but i feel so awful not just about this manager or incident but also working there in general and the anxiety is starting affect me in various physical ways i honestly just feel so stupid all the time it doesn t help i have some health issues such as brain fog that make things difficult sometimes i feel like i am constantly misinterpreting people and making mistakes all i want is to feel competent thanks for reading my rant,social_anxiety
1pokjmg,why do my coworkers laugh at me hi to anyone reading i dont know what to search to find an answer but im super self conscious in public and have social anxiety and this has been bothering me for a while i m 22f and i work in a care home doing nightshift when i first started work for the first few days i had to work dayshift very awkward and useless just watching people working the whole day i barely remember any interactions with anyone i remember being polite and try to make small talk mostly just wait until they talk first lol then i got moved to nightshift after a week everything was okay i was doing little assistant sort of tasks until one morning somebody asked me to see to a resident i sort of blue screened until i eventually said okay and went to the resident she was very sleepy and floppy to sit up onto the bed i started changing her until my back hurt so much from holding her up comfortably so i placed her down and asked for help it s already like 6 minutes past shift change so dayshift is there 3 people rushed into her room and looked shocked i saw their faces and i instantly started crying and panicking having sort of skipped breathing hicks i got reassured everything is okay and that they phrased it wrong saying to just scan her qr code on her door as a check like other residents i must have forgot to check her earlier the problem was she s a double and it was a risk for me and the resident to get ready and was almost impossible to change in the morning they said they were impressed that i actually got her almost ready in bed but i didn t care i only cared about the resident and i was never told she was a double many people are singles on that floor so being me i did whatever they asked me to without question as i worry i ll sound stupid if i ask them which is silly but it s better to be prepared for high risk patient care knowledge then myself looking stupid all of the day shift saw me crying and hyperventilating and panicking as i was worried i hurt her i didn t but they were saying everything okay and to go home and rubbing my back and holding my hand i felt like a child i felt stupid i felt insecure and useless this is why i think dayshift laugh at me when they see me now it s been 3 months and i know better one morning last week i was signing a paper and 2 dayshift girls behind me said cmon wait for jess to sign it and laughed at the time i didn t think much until i got home why did they say that i was only 5 seconds weird and yesterday don t know if it was the same girls but i squeezed past them to empty a cup into the sink before i left she didn t notice me and stepped backwards and bumped into my arm i was the one to say sorry i don t know why but she turned to her friend and started laughing why i just don t get it i gave them a questioning look as they turned their backs to me i struggle alot with crying i cry very easily i use to be a very angry kid until the anger switched to crying instead as i grew up i just want to know why people act like this i was going through alot during my first shifts and i feel like an idiot and treated like a child by the seniors because i can easily cry they ve only seen me cry that one time and nightshift one time when a resident was physically abusing me which was an understandable reason lol but when i cry it s not from sadness it s from frustration confusion guilt and anger but i think they think i m unstable and need babying i m tired of the just ignore them when they laugh at you don t waste time thinking about it i need answers,social_anxiety
1poj43e,anyone else great socially but an anxious mess when they re alone i wanted to see if anyone here experiences something similar to me i haven t used this sub reddit before so i m not sure how common this is i can socialize just fine i hold conversations mess around even act like the joker in my friend group most people wouldn t guess i struggle at all but the moment i m alone my anxiety hits hard and i ruminate my brain flashes intrusive thoughts overthinking events or interactions for years afterward and i get physical tension like a tight chest sweating or even small tics like blinking hard or pinching myself i feel like i always have to scroll on my phone before going to bed to keep distracted or negative thoughts will keep playing in my mind small things can trigger it i get the usual why did i say that or why would i wear that outfit but i feel it s particularly strong when it comes to not being able to control how im perceived for e g i started a secret tiktok to finally express myself without feeling overwhelming shame one friend found it and mentioned it during a call and even thought i know its not that serious i immediately started sweating chest tight almost in tears and had to act like it didn t bother me after the call i started deleting videos because i didnt want my friends to see that side of me despite having other followers on that account even after calming myself down i couldnt relax knowing that side of me has been seen since then every time i m alone i replay that idea the i ve been exposed endlessly i ve been told in the past by people around me that it s okay to open up and i know logically the people around me would be supportive but i still feel extreme discomfort i ve always struggled to open up and even when i share something small like a hobby or plan i regret it afterward once i m home but what has me confused is that the next day i m fine socially again joking chatting and making a fool of myself yet it starts over again as soon as i m alone for other reasons i am quite sure i have adhd which i think has helped me at getting distracted but desperate to open up but my anxiety makes me overthink the interaction once i m not distracted anymore i m used to seeing the version where people get anxious building up courage to or just being around others i used to have this version only experiencing it delayed once i get home is what i find strange does anyone else experience this type of anxiety where you function great socially but struggle internally especially when alone or thinking about how you re perceived how do you cope tl dr: i act great socially but overthink and get anxious when alone replaying interactions feeling physical tension and obsessing over how i m perceived only to repeat again the next day anyone else relate,social_anxiety

1pofnkt,my feeling of loneliness is no longer temporary it s gone beyond that it s become a routine at some point being alone stopped feeling temporary it just became my normal there were no messages to reply to no plans to cancel no one really checking in my days started blending into each other wake up do what i need to do kill time somehow sleep and do it all again not because i wanted to be alone but because trying to connect felt exhausting and risky what s strange is how easy it is to get used to it you don t walk around thinking i m lonely you just stop expecting connection you move through the day quietly loneliness slowly turns into routine the hardest part wasn t the silence itself it was the feeling that i was fading out of people s lives like i could disappear and no one would really notice most days i m still alone that part hasn t suddenly changed but i ve stopped telling myself this is just who i am or that it means there s something wrong with me it s not a personality trait it s something that built up over time if your life feels quiet in a way that hurts you re not broken and you re not the only one living like this even if it feels that way sometimes the first step out of isolation isn t suddenly making friends it s realizing that loneliness became your default and admitting that you want something else,social_anxiety

1poe058,for a long time i thought i was scared of people but i realized something i m not afraid of talking i m afraid of starting once i say the first word my body slowly calms down what helped me wasn t forcing confidence it was making the first word smaller not a full sentence not a smart comment just yeah or okay or a small nod with one word i stopped waiting to feel ready and started letting my body warm up after i speak the fear doesn t disappear but it loosens if you struggle to talk try not to say more try to say less just enough to enter the moment,social_anxiety
1podw50,social anxiety but only with roommates having some roommate related frustrations and when i google my issues i keep ending up here as opposed to somewhere like a roommates subreddit wondering if i should take it as a sign for context: i struggle to leave my room when i think my roommates might be out and about in the shared space i skip meals sometimes because of this i feel hypervigilant unable to have my headphones in when they re chatting because i m eavesdropping in fear that they re saying something about me i worry about how my daily habits come off to them e g if i seem lazy or unsocial and i will go out of my way to act normal like pretending to leave to hang with friends when i m really just going out by myself the past three evenings i ve all spent in the city alone because i didn t want to be home i didn t want to seem like a shut in and if i left the house i could have dinner outside instead of cooking or eating dinner with my roommates whereas if i lived alone i would feel no guilt spending those evenings staying in is this a common roommate struggle or a sign of social anxiety i don t think i struggle significantly with social anxiety in other scenarios i guess sometimes but not to a debilitating or continuously frustrating degree i have depression but i always thought i only had a normal amount of anxiety so i never considered something like an anxiety disorder but should i be concerned,social_anxiety
1podshg,wtf is this point of talking when you get cut off and can t get your point across i m sick tired of it what s the point if talking if people cut you off and then put worlds in your mouth like let me fucking talk if you ask someone a question and then cut them off mid sentence you re fucked up unless this is an anxiety thing where you have to get a thought out before you forget or something then that s fine sick of feeling rushed when talking too let me fucking talk let me talk or leave me alone,social_anxiety
1podrsd,i miss my old self the one who used to act naturally when meeting people one of the hardest things about social anxiety for me isn t even the fear it s feeling like i m not the same person i used to be sometimes i look back at old videos or messages and i barely recognize myself i used to talk easily joke without thinking just exist around people without overanalyzing everything now it feels like that version of me disappeared conversations don t flow anymore i pause too much overthink every word or say things that feel stiff and unnatural it s not that i don t have thoughts or things to say they just don t come out the way they used to for a long time i kept trying to force myself back into who i was before i pushed myself to be louder more social more normal all it did was make me feel worse like i was constantly failing at being myself what helped at least a little was realizing that i m just not that version of me right now and that doesn t mean i m broken it means something shifted and my body and mind are still adjusting i stopped chasing how i used to be and let conversations be slower and quieter i stopped expecting myself to sound confident or interesting all the time i stopped comparing every interaction to the past i don t feel natural again not really but i also don t feel like i m pretending all the time and honestly that feels like progress if you ever feel like you lost yourself socially you re not alone sometimes it s not about going back to who you were it s about slowly learning how to live as who you are now,social_anxiety

1pnyt8l,is my communication style why my 5 year friendship is falling apart hi for some time i have been struggling with stress caused by a change in the style of my relationship with a friend i have known for 5 years this is a truly important relationship for me we met on roblox it was never a very close relationship we didn t write every day but we wrote every now and then whenever we wrote we had a lot of things to talk about our conversations could last for hours we always trusted each other and wrote literally about everything i would like to write like we used to again but i don t know what to do however for about half a year i feel that something has changed whenever i write the replies are kind of dry my friend doesn t write about herself as much anymore before literally from a conversation about how to cut carrots we could take it in any direction now when i write about studies life music i get a few short replies like aha okay mhm sometimes admittedly she tells me something about herself but she doesn t try to continue the conversation my anxiety got worse since i added her on ig and i see that she doesn t read messages so quickly or she reads them and doesn t reply to them i wouldn t have a problem with this if i didn t see that she is online on tiktok or ig and reposts different things so she clearly has time to at least reply i can t remember if this happened because of some behavior of mine or if it s just automatic i only know that once we argued because she forgot about a game with me and i was really angry about it but it seems to me that our conversation was already a bit dry then i also went to a psychologist recently i am a person with traits of the autism spectrum i also have a problem with small talk i very often write about myself i write mainly about my interests and i write really a lot i am also sensitive to every smallest change in contact hence my worry i wonder if it is simply my fault and if the problem lies in the fact that i write too much because i wrote so much before and yet we wrote all the time recently when we were writing she mentioned a male friend and said she writes with him literally about everything i don t know if she writes with him a lot or like with me when i confronted her about this she said she has depression and takes medication she also has spectrum traits this is why she replies to me like this i don t question that she likes me because we still play games and i m in her close friends on ig i know that my communication style is intense and monologue like however what is crucial for me: for a week i have been writing with another person from university and despite the same intense style i receive a lot of initiative back from her i feel engagement and we talk fluently this confirms my belief that the problem with my friend is something other than just me do you think she stopped liking me or is this just her avoiding a close relationship breadcrumbing should i withdraw from this friendship or fight for contact,generalized_anxiety

1pnjbku,i went to grocery store last week i know seems rather innocolous although many of you here know such simple task can be eventful and daunting for a person with social anxiety i usually avoid going to the store and just cook from the food my family brings home but that day i was determined to buy food myself my brain did what it always does and had me over analyzing and racking up awkward scenarios not knowing where to put my hands feeling awkward around a group of women likely my age walking by or if it s rude to stare at someone s general direction while i m waiting for them to finish checking out self checkout and if you re wondering it is rude so i turned around to mind my own business anyways aside from those moments something a bit interesting happened i always sort of struggle when it comes to hiding my feelings and this is true for social situations as well so i imagine i look a bit timid when letting the guard check my receipt anyways when i was putting away my basket it got stuck and i verbally muttered something to myself before picking my bags up and leaving because i felt so embarrassed i wasn t about to sit there and calmly make sure the basket would stack nicely after already feeling people were looking at me an older gentlemen who happened to be behind me was talking to the guard when this happened i heard him make a comment about how i must ve decided to let the workers do their job sort of implying i was being a bit stuck up you know like the people who leave food out in the isle or their carts in the parking lot this combined with the laughter i heard moments ago when my cart was stuck must ve internally made me a bit insecure so i just wanted to get out of there i noticed that guy who was previously behind me was almost by my side he is pushing the cart a bit slow i decide to walk a bit faster so i can get out because he has a cart and it doesn t make sense for two people to walk through together so i speed up and walk past him to which he says to me something like: don t play with me or it wasn t even that exactly but that was the sentiment but essentially maybe he thought i was being rude and trying to test him when i quickly walked past temporarily perhaps causing him to slow down and of course i keep walking without looking back to which he says yeah keep walking and chuckles to himself as i m writing this i feel a lot of emotions coming back i don t understand why men have to constantly think everything is some social heiarchy game where any man or fuck it let alone anyone inhabiting a male body is trying to test them i wasn t trying to i never asked for this body i didn t ask for this life i didn t ask for any of it maybe i should ve stacked the basket neatly but i was rushed a bit anxious there was no reason to make those comments after already laughing at me with the guard i m clearly some awkward person who s not a real threat to you i wasn t even looking at you so why say those comments to me i thought about that interaction alot on my drive home i thought about a lot of things and honestly wanted to cry when i did get home i was still thinking about so much about how social anxiety has left my life so ridden how debilitating it all is how if i were to do something horrible to myself it would be because of social anxiety social anxiety i had gotten from my parents and their abuse it s messed up just how much this has ruined my life how am i supposed to live independently and make a living let alone carve a life out for myself when such small events leave trauma on my mind when i can t even feel comfortable around groups of strangers regardless of their age i don t understand how everyone else gets past it i know i just have to take small steps and to push myself and maybe then my mind will start to not fear awkward or embarrassing experiences because they become mundane but this one hurt,social_anxiety

1pnd87c,things are getting worse social anxiety has gone beyond affecting my interactions with strangers it has started to enter my home and affect how i treat my family i always thought social anxiety was about strangers public places or presentations i didn t expect it to slowly creep into my everyday life even at home with my own family simple things started to feel heavy small talk at dinner answering a question just being in the same room nothing bad was actually happening but my body acted like something was wrong what helped wasn t forcing confidence or trying to act normal i realized that anxiety doesn t mean i don t care it just means my nervous system is overwhelmed so i stopped trying to perform socially at home i aimed for neutral instead some days that meant sitting quietly without explaining myself answering briefly but honestly staying in the room a little longer than usual then leaving without guilt no speeches no pressure to be interesting no pretending little by little my body stopped reacting like these moments were dangerous they didn t become amazing or easy they just started to feel safe if social anxiety is affecting even your closest relationships you re not broken it usually means your system needs gentleness not more pressure you don t have to fix everything at once sometimes progress is just staying a little longer exactly as you are,social_anxiety

1pn5k6m,how to get rid of habitual fear of being in big groups of people i don t know honestly i thought social anxiety for me was a thing of the past now like year or two ago as i ve gradually adopted the idea that i don t care about what these people think i won t see them again however it s just occurred to me today very very clearly that i m afraid of big groups of people i don t know or rather like groups that have an unknown vibe as im very careful of everything to not go against the vibe so i end up very avoidant and hide away but once i kinda get inside the group as in say like part of the conversation i m all goods it s just the getting into the group part is scary i don t know i thought i m past this but clearly i m not i always end up only joining a group with a connection to any individuals that seem more approachable and like one on one conversations but in reality i really really want to just join the group when i can as individuals being separated from the group is very specific and won t happen a lot so what are some tips or maybe things i should practice on or do i just need to confront my fear the next time,social_anxiety

1pn26ao,why do i randomly get social anxiety while other times i m good hi im 24m i was a very confident and happy person when i was a kid i still feel like i have that part of me but something messed me up i guess when i was a kid i moved to a different country and the culture shock was real i didn t feel it at the time but i found that the kids in my school had very different interests than me i lived in a pretty conservative culture before so when i moved and saw the kids were more free and did a lot of things like talking about girls and music all the time was something i didn t really know about don t get me wrong my life before wasn t closed off and everything was taboo or anything it just wasn t many of people s interests i was also like 10 at the time so either way i would still be new to listening to music and talking about girls regardless i had a little trouble making friends first especially close ones i was good in school and kids and teachers quickly noticed me and that boosted my confidence yet i still couldn t make close friends i now see that my personality isn t really a charismatic one and i don t talk alot that s part of it i think anyway throughout high school and even before i started experiencing some bullying but i always gave a tough view to everyone and challenged people and was able to stand my ground most of the time internally though i think that s how my social anxiety started i would go everyday thinking about how i would need to prove myself today and who would i need to fight off to get to the point nowadays i feel like i get a few days where i feel like myself and i can crack jokes and be social while the rest of the days i feel tired and anxious even if i wear the tough confident mask and i cannot function normally because of it i know that people who know me well know that i am kind of weird or that i can t hold a conversation but it s because that small window of socializing confidence is too small for them to get it feels overwhelming as i get bored alot of the time and i feel that family members whom i respect sometimes have this kind of disappointed look as they wanna see me excel and want to know me better but i have trouble expressing myself i feel like i have a chance to fix this but it s been years at this point and i am learning as i am growing but how long do i need to wait life is passing by me and i feel like i m missing out ps sorry for the very long post i just poured my heart out here,social_anxiety

1pmvoac,i found something that helped my social anxiety around gaming i ve been dealing with social anxiety for years and one of the biggest things i avoid is voice chat in games like i genuinely love gaming but the second someone asks me to hop on discord i just freeze up and make some excuse about my mic being broken or whatever i know it s irrational but i can t help it my brain just goes into panic mode thinking about saying something stupid lately i ve been trying to push myself a little because honestly i m tired of playing everything solo feels really lonely sometimes tried joining a few discord servers but they re either dead silent which makes it worse or way too chaotic to start couple weeks ago i tried game nights with strangers but there s someone hosting it so they guide the conversation and i don t feel like i have to carry the convo i ve been going to these ludio sessions and i m starting to feel more confident me not trying to figure how to keep the conversation going reliefs me a bit i still get anxious before joining and sometimes when there is more people the hosts are really good at keeping things moving so there s no dead air even if i feel that what i just said is very dumb sometimes talking to strangers in a more controlled environment can help to get confidence,social_anxiety
1pmue01,why am i like this my whole life i ve more or less been an outcast from elementary to high school i used to practically never speak at all to the point where people would wonder if i was mute especially early on i couldn t even speak when asked questions by teachers as i grew older i began to be able to speak in more formal scenarios but to this day even as an adult i find it impossible to hold a casual conversation or gain friendships my mind goes blank i give one word responses and the other party quickly realizes how utterly uninteresting i am barring my immediate family i have no one to confide in and in recent times i ve even grown distant from them and it s starting to dawn on me how i ve wasted some of the best years of my life friendless and alone that i ve missed out on so many experiences because of my inability to open up to others as a child i used to tell myself that i preferred being alone that i was happier that way in the end it deprived me of practically any social skills that i could have used to change myself life is a boring slog i have things to keep me entertained but at the end of the day i m left unsatisfied and unfulfilled and i can t help but wonder why me what went wrong in life for me to turn out this way i had good parents a good home life i ve never been diagnosed with autism or any other such disorder why was it so hard for me to speak from the very beginning my younger sister was born to the same parents was raised under the same circumstances and even as a child she was more confident and socially capable than i ve ever been it s like she lives in another world i saw her chatting up a complete stranger so casually that i d initially assumed they were friends or at least acquaintances and i can t help but feel a tinge of jealousy why couldn t i have turned out like that why have i been cursed with this miserable existence it s irrational of course and self centered to assume to that she doesn t to have struggles of her own and yet a part of me can t help but feel that way every time i try to reach out i end up stumbling over my own words or have nothing interesting to offer people are taken aback by my awkwardness and even a slightly confused look makes me feel ashamed and embarrassed i m so disconnected from normal society that it genuinely feels impossible for me change i m a young man in my twenties i have my whole life ahead of me and yet it feels so utterly hopeless,social_anxiety
1pmu4c3,i went to the nightclub for the very first time at the age of 18 and actually had loads of fun this was a few weeks ago so i don t remember much the drinking age where i live is 16 btw so a lot of ppl already start partying at that age or younger anyways there was a party being advertised at various highschools in my area so i bought a ticket cuz clubbing is supposed to be fun and it would have been sort of an exposure therapy expecting some people from my class to also be there however the tickets sold out quickly so those who did say that they d be going ended up not and i was the only one from my class going to the party so i almost didn t go however i pulled myself together and went there anyways alone since i knew that there d still be people from my school whom i know and cuz i paid for the ticket and when i reached there i found a group of kids from my school with whom i talk rarely but who welcomed me anyway and i drank a bunch of alcohol in the waiting line which i guess is why my anxiety symptoms lessened and once inside i saw them dancing uninhibited on the dancefloor so i joined them and had the time of my life i had never been to a club before so this was all knew to me and i also kinda regret not ever having experienced such stuff earlier like a lot of people my age have done but i loved shouting the lyrics of the songs the dj played and jumping dancing along together with the other ppl from my school once i started getting ready to get home at 3am some girls from my school who were also getting ready to go home asked me some stuff i don t remember what exactly since they know me as the quiet kid but i was actually quite open that night and i told them that i have a social anxiety disorder and they actually showed a lot of sympathy towards me and didn t pity me which is something hate and yeah i then went home and that s basically it,social_anxiety

1pmpfqr,social anxiety is ruining my life and i don t know how to stop it not the best at writing posts so apologies for weird formatting im a 21 year old guy and ive had social anxiety since i was in my early teens it slowly got worse over time especially during the pandemic but its at its worse i went to a relatively small school so i knew everyone there since kindergarten so making friends wasn t something i had to do i kept the same friends my whole life and when i moved to uni i found it impossible to make friends im too anxious to talk to people and i have no idea how to start conversations i adapted a mindset of only speak when spoken to which ruined me further any conversation i have now is short and surface level and i don t know how to bring it further because of this conversations bring me a lot of anxiety and i try to avoid them always i know how bad this is and its killing me and i have no idea where to start i know therapy is a start but i have so much anxiety with therapists i don t know how i could do it i do have a psychiatrist and am on ssri and anti anxiety the ssri sorta helped me im able to go out in public and cosplay as a person lol and was even able to get a job which surprised me but all i ever really want is friends and a social circle or somebody to talk to and it feels impossible to get i have tinder and i get a decent amount of matches but i never start conversations and the conversations i do have are short lived the reason i don t start conversations is because you only have one shot at starting it and i don t wanna fuck it up with a bad start and ruin it i feel like im still in a good position to fix my life but i just have so much anxiety about everything all i can do is hide in my room and not talk to anyone i get scared of notifications i also smoke a lot of carts which make me really paranoid and enforce this avoid isolate mindset im scared of everything and i don t know what to do every day is just miserable and it feels like the life i want is just out of reach i know i should stop smoking carts and i did stop for work and surprise surprise my anxiety got a lot less worse but everything is so boring without it i feel like if i had something else going on my life i wouldn t smoke it as much but i have literally nothing going on so im just home bored in my room all the time i need to get out and stop but don t know what to do anyways if u read this far thanks for listening to me yap,social_anxiety

1pmn7ip,i m an anxious attacher trying to get to know somebody that s got social anxiety to give some context i m 46f and 5 10 and he s 43m and 5 3 i really like him he brings his kids over to my neighbor s house to visit him and my kids go play with his even they re over i ve liked him from afar for a couple of years but situation never really aligned to make a move i tried about a year and a half ago but lost interest when he would be flirty over fb messenger but had no follow through so i hadn t seen him in person for probably 7 months and during that time i ve lost a bunch of weight and had a bit of a glow up i happened to be coming home at the same time he was leaving my neighbor s house and he stopped and chatted for a few and appeared to be lingering a bit i went in the house and he went on his way and not long after i noticed he was liking some of my pictures and posts i thought i should reach out to him again so i sent a flirty gif of the pink rabbit in robinhood waving her ear flirting with robinhood and he responded with a gif of thumper excitedly thumping his foot one thing led to another and i invited him over to my house to cuddle me and get back tickles and just chill he actually came over but told me during the cuddling that he was so nervous on his way over that he considered asking me if i had any alcohol so he could have a shot to relax i asked why he was so nervous and he said he s got social anxiety i asked if he was still nervous and he said yes but we kept cuddling and running hands all over each other as he was leaving i told him i m off wednesday off he wants to do it again and we tentatively made a plan he said to call him the next day i realized i don t actually have his phone number so i sent him number if you want it and he didn t respond or text me later that night i sent hey i just wanted to tell you that i know it was hard for you to come over yesterday with your anxiety going i really appreciate you pushing through it and coming through anxiety sucks i m quite familiar with the old worry that i ve done or said something dumb and revisiting everything i said to people that day to make sure i didn t upset anybody anyway fighting those demons is tough and you kicked it s ass don t ever worry about bothering me either i ll probably bother you before you bother me now keep in mind all he would have seen on his notification was hey i just wanted to tell y but he didn t even open the message later in the day the next day i sent is it wednesday yet and shortly after that he opened and put heart reacts on both of those two messages but didn t say anything knowing he s socially anxious but not knowing to what degree i just figured he didn t know what to say to that so i let another day go by before saying happy friday i hope the rest of your week went well and he responded about his week being mostly good besides having a sick kid anyway i just wrote him hey there mr name we re halfway to wednesday i could definitely go for more cuddles with you and he opened it and didn t say anything does this sound like disinterested energy or does it sound like he s overwhelmed and not sure what to say am i being too much on the one hand i feel like it s mostly been back and forth and not clingy but on the other hand with somebody socially anxious is he thinking i m smothering him with my once a day messages is he just scared of saying the wrong thing and feels better in person talking over texting i m noticing i might just be pretty socially anxious myself,social_anxiety

1pmlmwc,why does reaching out feel so wrong i have so many people around me that i am cordial with and even a few friends that i occasionally talk or hang with but i m never the one to initiate conversations or hangouts it just feels wrong for me to initiate contact for some reason even when i want to i want to talk about interests and do fun things but i am also so scared to do so at the same time even my best friend who i ve known since kindergarten i feel scared to make plans with or even start a convo with gahjjjjj i can t just sit and keep waiting for people to come and break me out of my shell i have to act by my own volition and actually take control of my life if i do it enough i m sure i ll get used to it but damn it s so hard to start,social_anxiety
1pml1kw,i often end up lying unintentionally because i panic or because my mouth moves faster than my thoughts can keep up i used to have really bad social anxiety but after years of effort it s gotten a lot better and i became really confident because honestly i m very proud of my progress but i noticed that i often end up lying unintentionally when i m talking to people mostly in a group setting i don t panic or get embarrassed or anxious when talking to someone 1 on 1 either because i panic or because my mouth moves faster than my thoughts it gets worse when i m drinking even if i m not drunk or tipsy i become more confident which basically means i talk faster and talk more i know i need to talk less but i ve spent most of my life hating being ignored or dismissed now my problem feels like the opposite of before maybe i feel too confident and i talk too much and while rambling is one thing i sometimes end up exaggerating or saying things that aren t true without meaning to often it s just small details but sometimes it s not so minor but it s never intentional and never something that matters i feel like a liar but correcting myself later is a lot weirder i don t know how to phrase things accurately or i blank out panic and mix things up at the moment i genuinely believe what i m saying is true but later i realize it wasn t i speak pretty fast by nature and slowing down is really hard but when i stick strictly to the facts everything i say feels unbearably boring i honestly don t know how to balance this,social_anxiety
1pmiurb,is my psychiatrist fuc ing me over hi everyone i m writing because i m really confused and i don t know if i m overreacting or if my concerns are actually valid i m 24 and for about 4 years i ve noticed a major drop in sexual desire and functioning i used to get aroused easily and sometimes i d even get anxious talking to someone because i liked them so much now it feels like i experience very little if any sexual attraction and in general my orgasms also feel much weaker at first i thought it was just stress and i ignored it but over time it started to weigh on me so i went through several appointments with different endocrinologists at one point they suspected a condition which i won t name for privacy but it was later ruled out after repeating tests multiple times my sexual hormone levels testosterone etc have generally been normal the last endocrinologist told me that in her opinion it made sense to rule out a major biological cause and recommended psychotherapy with a psychiatrist psychotherapist who s very well known in my city and is also a sexologist i was very reluctant i ve always been a controlled person calm i almost never get angry and overall i ve always managed my life without major issues so the idea of starting therapy felt very far from me but i agreed both because i didn t want to rule anything out and because when you re young and have sexual problems doctors often dismiss it as anxiety and that s it i wanted to be able to say i d explored that route too so i d be taken more seriously by doctors i started in september the treatment is very expensive and honestly it doesn t seem to be helping with the main issue sexually i haven t noticed any improvement in other areas maybe a little some self esteem improvement and for the first time in my life i m starting to feel the urge to come out to my parents i m also attracted to men and they don t know but after months regarding the problem that brought me there i see no results and i still think it might be more physical than psychological here s the main point in my last session i talked about two things: i ve always had difficulty with physical contact if someone hugs me i often tense up and pull away my friends know this talking through different situations we concluded i might have mild social anxiety i actually agree with that it s not disabling i have a normal life i go out i have friends i can talk to people and i ve lived on my own for 5 years but in certain contexts new environments new activities meeting new people i struggle more and i definitely have some anxiety issues what shocked me is that basically out of nowhere my psychiatrist suggested starting a medication: sertraline i was stunned it felt like a huge leap from mild social anxiety and a sexual issue that i still don t convincingly connect to psychology to prescribing me an ssri and to be clear she herself confirmed that i don t have mood disorders and up until now she hadn t even mentioned medication i tried to express my concerns but she insisted it was the right choice and wanted me to start literally the next day when i vaguely mentioned it to my parents without going into detail they got scared and had more or less the same concerns as me also online i read that sertraline is an ssri and that it s known for potentially worsening sexual functioning which really freaks me out since i m going there specifically for that problem of course i ll talk to her again but she seemed very determined and that made me lose trust i already had some doubts during the process but this really threw me off i m seriously thinking about stopping both because i m not seeing sexual improvements and because i don t feel comfortable with this prescription,social_anxiety

1pmhegg,how the hell does one navigate work organization type of parties parties in general are so difficult for me i had two parties in the past few weeks with an organization i m involved with i m not talking about a wild party at someone s house with booze and drugs everywhere i m talking about an adult social event type of thing the first one: i got to the place which was like an arcade thing with all kinds of games and entertainment and bowling i just stood against the wall and nobody talked to me i had to leave after 15 minutes despite everyone else bowling doing karaoke playing pool etc i don t know how to penetrate the little groups of 3 4 people talking in a circle what do i do just walk up and insert myself feels so awkward and my heart was pounding i went and sat in the car for an hour came back in spent another 15 minutes standing there talking to nobody and anxiety won i just left there was another event at a coffee shop again i had to force myself to go in i stood there and a few people talked to me but going around introducing myself just seems impossible this time i made it through the night because when i run away from situations i feel so much worse in the end but i truly don t understand how people get into these little chat groups circles it feels like the hardest thing in the world just ranting i guess,social_anxiety
1pmh3bi,propranolol dosage i ve been trying to find a medication to help me with my major blushing issue the last couple months i ve been on a journey to find a medication that will help me with this i first started on propranolol 10 mg didn t notice any difference then propranolol 30 mg again didn t notice any difference then i tried clonidine hydroxyzine and most recently gabapentin the gabapentin has definitely improved my mood but doesn t do much for my social anxiety and blushing today i went to church and beforehand took 80 mg of propranolol i found that this helped me extremely i was able to hold conversations with numerous people after service and didn t feel any of the symptoms of social anxiety my question is is 80 mg an acceptable does that a doctor would prescribe my blood pressure is already elevated and how do i go about telling my doctor that i took a medication at a higher dose than what was prescribed and i d like to switch back to that medication and dosing the last time i met with my doctor he told me that the next step if gabapentin didn t work would be going on an ssri which i would like to avoid at all cost since i was already on one a couple years ago and it did nothing but turn me into a zombie,social_anxiety

1pmfwyk,kicked out of a group activity before it even began i ve had the reddit app for so long now and never actually made an account so here i am now lol at the time of this happening i was 19 i am freshly 20 now this happened at the tail end of august i had this seasonal job as a prep cook and with the way the work stations were situated i was spending most if not all of my days with this particular coworker for the record he was really nice and somewhat of a friend mentor to me: this was my first kitchen job we both have adhd and he was incredibly awesome with helping me out whenever i didn t know what the hell i was doing i ve had pretty bad anxiety since i was a kid socially performance wise and am on meds for adhd it helps me a bit and this past year or two i ve been making an active effort to engage with the world around me a bit more outside of my many comfort zones this doesn t take away the fact that i still have very basic at times awkward social skills i talked to this coworker with the most ease because we had similar interests part of that being table top rpgs infact this is one of the first things he told me about: he was wanting to assemble a group to play his homebrew d d and start the campaign in january this was month 1 of that seasonal job i like ttrpgs mostly stick to solo one pagers and character creation and acting and everything but specifically i ve always wanted to play just remotely anything with a group he said he was gonna ask some more of my coworkers that looked nerdy i was one of the first people at that workplace that showed interest in his campaign told him i d love to join and he was cool with that i think a lot of us introverts anxious folks can agree that it takes a while for us to get out of our shell and show our true selves off i don t say this as way to soothe myself but the more i talked to this coworker everyday the more i could obviously feel myself get more comfortable i like to be silly and we matched eachother s stupid jokes and even that alone helped me gain a smidge more confidence when i interacted with others he kept bringing up his d d campaign always telling me who else he had managed to recruit and aside the nervousity i was excited to start most of these people i already knew too sometimes we d also talk about me doing art videos for the campaign once it d progress far enough anyways come the week before i get laid off we were talking about the campaign again he was talking on for a bit about the general structure and how it was gonna work and specifically was pretty excited about the fact he managed to recruit one of our admins somewhat close to my age and for the record she s really nice and generally enjoyable company to be around and has a literal acting degree from vancouver to boot and loves d d i don t know if that factors into anything right after that unprompted he tells me word for word you re not gonna be part of the group though not charismatic enough which right about killed me i feel some sort of distressed anxiousness recalling the memory now but back then i don t think i had much of an exterior reaction outside of a quick oh haha okay i still feel pretty down about it if anything i thought i was like being a lot better socially around him in specific like we had a lot of laughs together and often did silly voices character bits so i didn t really anticipate being told this out of the blue one of the things that frustrates me about this is that i don t know what else i could ve done about it i know some part of this i can chalk up to my conversational skill differences between english and my maternal language i just really hate how out of the blue this came out not to get mopey but this happens so often i suck so bad with seeking social situations out but i do try my hardest and i ve wanted friends for so long now every group setting or activity i ve tried to integrate myself into either doesn t happen or group falls out or i wasn t particularly close with anyone but they all were or includes me as a noticeable afterthought which i wind up refusing: not letting myself be treated like that i try to not let myself get too down about it but the more i try the more i feel myself veering towards hating companionship as a whole and that stings i don t blame my coworker 100 for how he wants to run his group that still doesn t negate the hurt i felt from his comment even the one friend that i do have one i used to consider my best friend i ve had my horrible issues with and i ve been intentionally withdrawing from him for his behavior i just hate how the general loss of friendship is becoming a trend with me i feel like the d d thing specifically crushed my confidence i thought i was making good work for myself stepping out of my comfort zone so to be hit with what is essentially you re not good enough for this thing from someone i respected really stung and i ve noticed i ve been a lot more wary and skeptical since then feels like the entire dramatic wellbeing brain in my skull is bracing itself against any new social setting that arises now and i don t like that self deprecation i m sorry for the long post how do i learn to be more charismatic and moreso what does that even entail if anyone has any advice on coming out of their shell i d love to hear it and furthermore how adults are making friends these days thank you for reading,social_anxiety

1pm9kog,oxytocin has anyone taken oxytocin for social anxiety once i heard the name i immediately assumed it was a dangerous drug because it s often related to heroin methanol and those bad ones but i checked and it is safe lol i ve heard of it before but didn t know what it s used for besides pregnancy anyways i looked it up because i have been resistant towards nearly every medication i ve tried for my social anxiety and depression and nothing has been effective enough for me yet i was bored and did some research and found that oxytocin in the nasal spray form is actually the most studied medication for social isolation and loneliness which i ve always had but i m reaching my peak and so depressed i got so excited when i read that because nothing else i ve looked into is known for that most meds i see can be effective for social anxiety but i have that loneliness and have socially isolated myself my whole life and literally have no friends lol so i thought this looked cool to potentially try to see if it helps has anyone tried it not surprised if no one hasn t it s almost never brought up when trying to actually find effective meds for severe social anxiety would love to know your experiences edit: i see many people confusing oxytocin with oxycodone very different drugs oxycodone is an addictive drug in the same family as heroin morphine fentanyl etc oxytocin is a natural hormone which is known for social bonding love trust etc,social_anxiety

1pm6hv4,is it lexapro withdrawal or is this deadass just me hi yall i m a college kid 19f and i ve been outgoing my whole life i love parties getting to know new people and have been described by others as extroverted but i hang out around a lot of introverts and like all kinds of people don t care if interactions are awkward sometimes now for context: recently i ve been getting about 4 hours or less of sleep a night because i m an art student and it s finals week during this time i ve been away from my apartment so i keep forgetting to take my albeit low dose of lexapro up until yesterday it had been about six days anyway let s get to the meat now i went to a party last night with a few people i know somewhat well from class and had a great time no social anxiety issues but this morning when i was invited to my best friend s apartment for pancakes and pulp fiction i felt like i was being annoying the whole time every word that came out of my mouth felt stupid and like i didn t want to say it i was apologizing a shit ton and was constantly checking my friend s facial expressions for a sign that they wanted me to leave but they never told me to go and actually made me coffee i felt so weird i ve noticed that this has happened to me before where i ll get these random bouts of social anxiety like once every couple of months around people i know very well and have been comfortable around for years also the people i associate myself with aren t even judgy they re wholesome nerdy art kids that are all very smart and sweet and exactly who i want to be around anyways i m just wondering if anybody else has this same issue or if it s just me here s what i m thinking the potential reasons are: med withdrawal anxiety might be higher but i ve felt this even without med withdrawal fear of rejection with people that are close to me i care about them so i m more worried about irritating them because i don t want to lose the people i love hangover i ve heard if you re on lexapro alcohol worsens depression so probably worsens anxiety too adhd: i don t know if my adhd affects social interaction even in sporadic bits but i feel like a lot of weird shit is explained by my adhd so maybe that s why the end tl:dr i randomly felt a bout of social anxiety around one of my best friends for no reason today even though i am normally pretty outgoing looking for insight explanation,social_anxiety

1plwfbe,am i overreacting about being booed by my entire school hi i m a middle school teacher and i m trying to figure out if i m overreacting two weeks ago our avid teacher i ll call her ms cee emailed me and three other teachers about a fundraiser where students donate money into jars with teachers names and whoever raises the most gets pied in the face at a pep rally she asked if we were okay with it the next day i told her i did not want to participate i truly couldn t think of anything worse another teacher ms kay actually wanted to do it and offered to take my spot ms cee said they d keep my name on the jar and have ms kay get pied if i won but i clearly stated i did not want my name used at all and that students needed to be told ms kay was participating instead despite this my name stayed on the jar for two weeks announcements kept saying i was in the lead and students told me daily they were donating so they could see me get pied i kept telling them i wasn t participating i ended up winning for my grade since ms cee teaches 8th grade i emailed the 7th grade avid teacher ms s whose classes were the ones who nominated me again stating i had opted out she said it wasn t an issue yesterday morning i asked ms cee if i could stay in the bleachers since ms kay was getting pied she told me no saying the kids donated for you and that i needed to show face as a courtesy i was repeatedly told to do it for the kids and to step out of my comfort zone even after i explained i have severe social anxiety and being the center of attention is extremely distressing for me let alone being in a social setting such as a pep rally i am the type of person who likes to go unnoticed and i absolutely hate attention they thought it would be funny to call me down and just trick the kids and say that i elected to have a representative i was against this out of fear public humiliation at the pep rally ms cee called my name and had me stand in the center of the gym after the cheering stopped she announced i had opted out and that ms kay would be pied instead immediately the entire gym 1 300 students started booing and heckling me so loudly she couldn t speak over the mic for almost a minute i joked it off and walked away but internally i was devastated afterward students continued yelling at me calling me a scammer and a loser and one even flipped me off as i walked to my car other teachers later asked why i didn t just do it even after i explained i had set boundaries which i hate that i even have to do one teacher who is extremely outgoing had the nerve to tell me that experiencing something like that should ve cured my social anxiety i went home couldn t eat cried in the dark and i ve had intense anxiety and chest pain since this is my first year at this school and as a young second year teacher already dealing with high functioning depression this pushed me to my breaking point i already feel overwhelmed and unwanted and this made it worse i m also angry at ms cee she was someone i trusted and saw as a mentor and now i don t feel emotionally safe at my school i know pep rallies are meant to be fun and this probably wouldn t bother many people but being singled out pressured and publicly booed has been replaying in my head nonstop that was literally my worst fear come true i feel helpless defeated and deeply humiliated and i don t know how i m supposed to walk back into that building feeling okay tl dr: i m a middle school teacher with severe social anxiety who clearly opted out of a pie in the face pep rally fundraiser despite repeatedly setting boundaries my name stayed on the jar and i was forced to be called to center stage at the pep rally when it was announced that i opted out and another teacher would be pied instead 1 300 students booed and heckled me and the harassment continued afterward i felt publicly humiliated unsupported and betrayed by a mentor i trusted this pushed me to my breaking point and has left me anxious physically unwell and dreading returning to work edit: thank you all for the kind words wisdom and validation i wish i could reply to you all and thank you individually but i literally started crying again as i was reading these so i am taking a breather it truly means the world to me,social_anxiety

1plk41u,is my childhood environment and upbringing caused me to be an introvert and alone hey everyone i m sharing this here because talking about it in real life usually leads to judgment or misunderstanding currently i find myself becoming very reserved preferring minimal interaction with people i ve become introverted short tempered emotionally drained and under constant career pressure i m trying to understand whether my upbringing and home environment played a role in shaping who i am today i come from a typical middle class indian household with very strict and controlling values small mistakes often turn into major issues even at 20 i need permission for basic things like stepping out briefly attending college events late night functions or social gatherings with friends is usually not allowed spending time outside studies is discouraged there is a strong expectation to focus only on academics and responsibilities once i m done studying i m expected to immediately help with household work leaving no space for rest or personal time privacy is almost non existent and even simple phone calls are questioned public criticism and embarrassment have been common often in front of relatives or others emotional well being is not given importance and discipline is seen as the only solution to every problem over time this made me stop expressing myself and stay silent to avoid conflict since childhood i ve been sincere with studies rarely asked for anything and avoided unnecessary expenses or demands by most standards i ve been a good child despite this i often feel controlled rather than supported my parents follow the same parenting style they experienced growing up and believe it s the only correct way my elder sibling does not support me either we ve never had a close or open relationship during conflicts instead of understanding my side the situation often worsens because of all this home feels mentally exhausting i often wish i could stay in a hostel or live away from home my biggest motivation right now is to secure a job in another state and become independent these experiences have affected my social and professional life i struggle with confidence making new friends maintaining eye contact and social interactions in general i ve never been in a relationship partly because i feel i have no control over my future decisions i ve developed anxiety in social situations and tend to stay silent most of the time as i learned that speaking up only creates problems i don t know how to stay calm happy or mentally balanced anymore i m considering living independently once i start working hoping it will bring peace and stability i m not posting this for sympathy or jokes i genuinely want to understand: can upbringing and home environment lead to these personality traits how do people cope heal and move forward from such experiences any respectful advice or shared experiences would really help thank you for reading,social_anxiety

1pkygxc,big breakthrough: performing a capella onstage i have felt self conscious about singing in front of other people for as long as i can remember i never had a musical education and always felt like i was behind my friends who could play instruments read sheet music etc i m always scared that other people are judging my singing whenever i do it public but i think music is really beautiful and i wanted to step out of my comfort zone so i joined an a capella group this semester we just had our year end performance not only did i sing for real in front of a packed theater for the first time but i even had 2 two solos where it was just me singing and everyone heard my voice out of the whole group this is a little niche but i feel really proud of myself if you relate then def take this as a sign to put yourself out there,social_anxiety

1pkvupk,biggest insecurity how can i stop being insecure of my voice i have a high pitched voice and i sound like i m suffocating and i also sound like a kid i wanna send to my online friend a voice message and i know it s crazy but i ve been trying to mimic the message i will send him to hear how it sounds like and it sounds horribleeeee i don t have the courage to send him but i still want to but how i know this may sound ridiculous but please help how can i accept my voice and send the voice message now,social_anxiety
1pkvipv,scared of voice calls honestly i don t think i have actual social anxiety so if this post doesn t fit here and gets removed could someone please redirect me to where i should post it i don t want to share this with anyone irl and i don t know where to talk about it online i 20f am scared about playing a video game with this guy i know from online we ve been talking for nearly 6 months we ve been sending lengthy messages to each other everything s been going well somewhere in september he proposed we could play a video game together over voice chat and i told him sure i kept postponing it until finally in early november we had a short 6 minute voice call for the first time i was extremely nervous i cried a little bit before the call but i pushed through it i had a feeling of i m gonna mess up and ruin everything sort of like a feeling of doom but it went fine his native language is english and mine isn t so that adds to the anxiety but i also just feel very nervous talking over the phone irl if i get a call from a random number or something my heart starts pounding etc i usually manage to act normal and everything tends to go fine if i pick up those calls or do things i m afraid of but i m still afraid each time especially because i like this guy and i am honestly very intimidated by him in his last message he said we should really play soon there s nothing to be nervous about i promise it s going to be fun and i feel so embarrassed i feel like he sees through me we both confessed we were nervous before the vc so it s not like this is new he knows i am nervous but the more i postpone it the more embarrassed i will feel and the harder it will be for me to finally do this with him i know the only solution is to keep pushing through these situations but i wish it was easier in the end it is my hesitant behavior that is going to ruin things not the fact that i d be a little awkward over a voice call i m tired of being such a big chicken and sabotaging myself,social_anxiety
1pkucjg,i crave social interactions but fear them intensely my mind is in constant conflict is this just how it has to be for the rest of my life i struggle a lot with loneliness but then freak out at the possibility of actually socialising and feel euphoric when social events are cancelled or when my lame excuses for not going to an event have been accepted i ve been living like this for literally decades and it s crushing me,social_anxiety
1pku83k,does anyone else feel scared of changing things even when the current situation already scares them there s something that fears me more than the known fear i already live with i genuinely want to take action and fix things in my life but the moment i actually try to change anything i get this intense uneasy almost dread like fear that makes absolutely no rational sense it s like i know the bad outcome is already coming if i don t act but somehow my brain convinces me that intervening will make things even worse than the obvious fear i m trying to avoid almost like: if you touch this you ll make it worse so just wait for the inevitable i don t know if people get what i m trying to say has anyone else felt this what is this fear even called and how did you deal with it,generalized_anxiety

1pks3s3,i literally can t even go to a christmas party without wanting to leave and not want to try socializing ever again idk where to even start with this i guess i should start by saying that anxiety and depression are a part of me pretty much been with me since childhood and now my 30 year old self never had any friends either and have pretty much spent my entire life alone socially i mean i have family members that love me not in high school or college did i ever have a friend to talk to or hang out with i hardly even talk to my coworkers except to say good morning or ask them about something and so i decided to go to my company s christmas party last night mainly because i thought that no one would recognize me i work in a different building than most of the people there and while that went over fine it s the socialization part that i couldn t get through everyone in their own groups and such why should i go over and talk to them they don t know me and i d just be interrupting them was basically my mindset i stayed for about two hours before i left the only thing that made the night more bearable besides free food was of course the alcohol booze and weed are legitimately the only things that even give me a nudge away from social anxiety and let me come out a bit but of course in our society that s a no no to be dependent on a drug to function like most people do even if you re someone like me when lexapro does precisely jack shit but i digress as i said i m 30 years old now if i didn t have family members wanting me to remain alive i would ve checked out years ago i simply do not care anymore i m going to die and leave this world almost as if i never existed and that s fine we all get forgotten about eventually i don t care about my life i don t see any value in myself and don t care to change as i said no one will remember me anyway so what s the point of socializing what s the point of connecting with people what s the point of having sex if i won t be able to perform anyway you get the idea,social_anxiety
1pkrrsl,question to those 35 years or older i watched a video talking about how the brain starts fully maturing into early 30s and i asked chatgbt if it helps with social anxiety and it said it does like it becomes easier to regulate like you don t freak out as easily i wanna know those who are in their 30s and still have social anxiety what changes have you noticed if any at all,social_anxiety
1pkrgrr,been thinking about the word poise been thinking about it because that s exactly what i don t have lol check out this video of obama from years ago i won t directly link just append watch v sshe1yvrcag onto yt he misses a salute then 10 whole seconds pass before he comes back to fix it whereas i would have probably thought ah well i messed that one up it s like i sometimes view life like an actor who s only got one take to get it right whereas a poised person recognizes that it s in their power to rewrite the scene or perhaps they have a longer time horizon on which they allow themselves to be judged something like that makes me wanna revisit that book finite and infinite games,social_anxiety
1pkpwpd,struggling to get a job i m qualified i get interviews but i flunk them everytime because i m freaking out i m debating on just telling them i have anxiety beforehand these positions are office related no customer service required i know the job market is awful but interviews are at least a good sign in it how does anyone else get an office job with an unstable job market and debilitating anxiety how can i make it happen,social_anxiety
1pkpw0d,worried about never being ok again i ve had social anxiety for a very long time it started when i was a teenager about 15 i think but was relatively mild at the start but it increase greatly in severity after 17 then around 22 my psychologist and i managed to improve it significantly through exposure therapy but then after the pandemic both due to the pandemic itself and other personal reasons it got worse again it s still not as bad as it was before 22 but it s worse than it was before the pandemic regardless throughout all these years of ups and downs i haven t actually been able to shake it it s complicated though i still have anxiety when using the phone but a little bit less although it s mostly that i learned to deal with it better and still call and then when talking to people in general and just going about my anxiety was definitely decreased significantly after exposure it has gotten a bit worse again but again it hasn t returned to what it was at its height the anxiety did remain but at a manageable level especially before the pandemic but i also learned to handle it better and then in some situations the anxiety seems incredibly stubborn when i was in college group work was always extremely extremely difficult for me because being in a large group where i am expected to talk with many people i don t know well at once is basically the worst situation for my anxiety and regardless of how many times i ve done something like that it hasn t really improved my handling of it has improved a little bit in that i can just about barely do it when i really need to but it drains me completely afterwards and it is extremely exhausting so i can t do it on a regular basis i also know this person who plays dnd a lot with people and it s actually something i ve wanted to do for a long time and he s even invited me before but the thing is that i just can t do it if i really really needed to could i do it probably but it wouldn t be any fun because it would be extremely exhausting and i would feel severely anxious the entire time so i don t do it and then today i was talking to someone on a dating app and chatting online tends to be one of the easiest social interactions for me especially through text but dating apps increase the stakes so i still tend to experience social anxiety during it not as much as irl of course not even close but still enough to make things unpleasant like i m obviously thankful for any match i get but i also really have to wrestle through sending those messages and it s at moments like that that i wonder about my recovery because talking to people through dms online is something i ve been doing for a very very long time so exposure wise i am essentially working on it constantly but it feels like my anxiety isn t decreasing no matter how long i do it for and i really want it to it would make dating easier at the very least so at the end of the day i m left with a very complicated picture my phone anxiety reduced a little my handling of it got a lot better my in person anxiety in one on one conversations and being out and about decrease quite a lot and i got better at handling it but my anxiety in groups is still as high as ever despite exposure and i ve only barely gotten better at handling it and then in something like chats on a dating site the anxiety has barely moved despite significant exposure idk it s confusing and i worry about it i ve improved yes but social interactions to one degree or another continue to be a fight sometimes a huge fight i just want it to be like it was before 15 where i didn t feel any anxiety almost all of my life was so much easier that way,social_anxiety

1pki4uh,fear of being perceived how do i get over it i hope i word this in a way that is understandable so i can find some support guidance or even comfort knowing that someone else may struggle or has struggled with something similar i m 21 years old i m a female quite small 4 8 80 pounds this is important because it has bothered me most of my life i ve struggled with eating disorders since i was young i ve never felt my age i ve never felt comfortable in my own skin i struggle feeling like a grown woman i struggle finding beauty in myself i struggle with confidence presenting myself anything that is not cowering behind baggy clothes and keeping my presence small i can t stand when people look at me i can t stand being perceived this is very real and very damaging to my everyday life i m unsure whether or not my physical body is the full reason why i am this way or if it s things that have led up from my childhood up until now but i am constantly stuck in a state of dissociation i obsess about how i look and how i am presenting myself so often that i am never really in present time i m somewhere else somewhere in a future that doesn t exist a version of me that never will the version i could be in that very moment but instead of being i visualize it and dream about it instead of just being because i cannot let go i cannot be present it has ruined my life i ve never danced around anyone i ve never sung around anyone the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach i ve went to parties i ve went to the club i ve drank i ve smoked pot i ve taken molly i ve played my favorite songs loudly nothing makes me feel at ease enough to be myself because i am so caught up in both how i look doing whatever it is i should be doing and how right or wrong im doing it but im standing there like a deer in headlights feeing nauseous instead i have friends who love to sing and love to dance and with that have tried time and time again to make me dance with them gently easing me sometimes just telling me straight up to loosen up and move my body i can t i so badly wish i could but i can t i don t dance when im alone because i feel like im being watched even if im not i don t even really like to sing by myself if i catch myself doing it i grow embarrassed i would love to do these things but i just can t i get emotional because i genuinely feel stuck like i can t move my body i can t force myself to open my mouth to speak let alone sing car rides are awkward trying to have fun with friends or a potential boyfriend is awkward i will sing in my head and smile but even bopping my head feel impossible and embarrassing so i stay still while everyone else has a good time everyone knows me this way and they think im beyond strange and i don t blame them i hate myself for this i don t know where to start i don t know what to do to make myself feel comfortable i hate that everything feels embarrassing because i dont know how to do it right even if there is no right way especially when it comes to dancing to add on to sort of the same idea i don t drive either i am afraid of doing the wrong thing when it comes to being taught to being seen i avoided sports my entire childhood because i was afraid of failure afraid of embarrassment afraid of not being perfect first try afraid of being wrong i believe the same thing is happening when it comes to having fun with others and even by myself i get this same impending feeling of doom whenever im being taught to drive also i just want to cry the entire time many times i freeze up and cant move to make things easier on myself instead of facing it i say i dont know how and leave it at that i never try because why would i put myself in a position to possibly fail and embarrass myself i so desperately want to be able to at least try because when i don t i look like im not enjoying myself or in other situations like driving i just look lazy i don t know how to just feel good i don t know how to not think about what others are seeing or feeling i don t know how to not expect perfection i second guess the things i know how to do things ive known how to do for years i m never sure of myself even when i know something is true i can t stand that about myself this isn t only with dancing singing and driving it s everything i am at a complete loss i don t know where to start so i can gain confidence to conquer this very compact problem of mine i cry over this so much it s genuinely taken over my life i want to have fun and do these things i don t feel forced i don t feel like it isn t me i just feel stuck and embarrassed to the point that i would rather die than have fun because im unsure of myself :,social_anxiety

1pkdnom,does anyone else get anxious over the smallest interactions i feel ridiculous sometimes i don t know if this is relatable or just me being me today i went to a coffee shop and the barista asked hey how s your day going a completely normal question and my brain just froze i could feel my chest tighten my face get warm and all i managed to say was: good thank you even though my day wasn t good at all then i walked out feeling stupid for making it awkward even though nothing actually happened it s always the tiny interactions that hit me the hardest: asking a question saying excuse me ordering food speaking up when i need help or even just greeting someone i hate how my brain turns normal moments into a full body threat i m trying to get better some days i do okay other days it feels like i m broken in some weird way does anyone else feel this how do you deal with these tiny everyday panic moments just curious to know i m not the only one,social_anxiety
1pkddfg,exposure therapy is the cure exposure therapy for social anxiety works well and for almost every patient the reason it didn t work for you is you might not doing it correct because its little complicated than what we hear all the time say hi to a stranger take a walk in crowded space etc if you do these challenges while keeping your eyes on your phone rehearsing every sentence or distracting your self from the situation than exposure is not gonna work also if you are trying to control the situation so nothing bad is gonna happen it will not work just like anything in life it never works until you do it correctly the way exposure works is it is just like facing a phobia an example from my life would be me facing my fear of making eye contact in public with exposure here is what i did: before exposure: situation: walking in public while not avoiding eye contact and without distracting myself what i think is gonna happen: people is gonna laugh at me people will look at me thinking am weird strange and something like that people will come at me and say i don t think you should be here and stzrt bullying me etc how likely do you think this is what gonna happen: 75 percent what we want with exposure is to tolerate the risk either whats on my mind doesn t happen or it happens and i realize i can tolerate the discomfort i can handle more than i thought like being bullied or being seen as a total idiot hope this was little helpful let me know guys if want me to make a series of posts explaining this in detail based on my personal experience and the people i ve helped thank s,social_anxiety

1pk6fnh,how to end this phase i just need to speak honestly and say what s actually going on the truth is the last four years of my life have been lonely depressing and honestly really bad i had hoped that when i applied to university things would finally change that i d break that three year curse after school and start fresh but my first semester didn t go at all the way i expected i tried i genuinely tried everything even though i m more introverted by nature i pushed myself to be social and forced myself out of my shell tried to act outgoing smiling at random people helping initiating conversations listening to everyone s nonsense trying to be approachable it was draining exhausting but i still ended up with no real friends while everyone else already found their groups and their people people say university friendships don t last anyway but at least those people don t sit alone during every gap they don t end up in the library pretending to study just to avoid looking lonely aleast they have someone unlike me i also took a gap year which i thought would help my mental health but honestly it made things worse the isolation the anxiety the adhd like restlessness the depression everything intensified so stepping into university after a year of complete silence felt impossible and then the insecurities kicked in i m older than most people in my batch two years older and i don t fit the typical vibe of the girls around me like every time i don t understand something or score a few marks less than them i feel completely stupid i know i m not the only older one but my mind keeps telling me i m behind in everything socially academically emotionally and when literally no one initiates a conversation with you it starts eating you alive i keep wondering if i look unapproachable if i seem weird if i m doing something wrong these last three months there hasn t been a single day i ve come home without crying it s made me question whether i even have a purpose anymore feels like everyone around me is moving ahead while i m stuck older and still lost,social_anxiety

1pk2y0g,how can you work on becoming a less anxious person i m curious about your opinions i recently took a language exam and while i was watching the people around me i realized how much someone s general well being and basically everything is influenced by how nervous overthinking anxious or on the other hand how calm they are unfortunately i belong to the first group but i ve always been really interested in how i could improve myself especially in this area the usual calming thoughts don t really work for me even though i know there s nothing at stake nothing changes whether i pass or fail and that the examiners are just people too they hopefully won t intentionally hurt me etc i ve read so many of these typical don t worry ideas that i don t think you could tell me anything new but sadly none of it has really helped me move forward i still shake i can barely speak and it makes both the exam and the night before extremely difficult even while i m talking i don t calm down i often freeze up and can t think and my heart rate goes through the roof which makes me even more afraid the only somewhat comforting thought is that my problems don t start there but still when i m actually in the situation i can t detach myself from it i really envy those people who take exams completely calm with minimal anxiety as if they were just chatting with a friend my biggest wish is to improve at least a little but sometimes i feel like it might be physically impossible are people simply born this way making the whole thing hopeless or could you recommend any techniques thoughts books or literature that might actually help,generalized_anxiety
1pk2992,i can t live my life like this this is no life i m depressed just having to see everyone else around me enjoying their life being relaxed socializing talking and making friends in our society you have to be social to achieve most things networking making friends dating having careers it feels hopeless when you are just alone and nervous all the time when your life is going nowhere just stagnant everyone else is out going places meeting people making friends having relationships getting married having successful careers i feel like i m just stuck in place forever because social anxiety makes everything impossible,social_anxiety
1pk191o,am i introverted or is it deeper than that when i was younger i was extroverted hugging and talking to strangers when i was little but as i grew up i started to become more reserved and quiet to where i became labeled as introverted i don t really know when the change happened i just think of the times my mother used to say i was extroverted but i changed i don t even remember half my childhood anyway as i ve gotten older i ve come across some problems that i find wrong and not just introverted and i often ask myself why do i act like this _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the biggest problems i have are 1 i hate making eye contact with people i feel like if i look at them they will judge me think i m weird or call me out if i look them in the eyes my mother often told me to look people in the eyes or they will just assume you aren t paying attention 2 i don t understand why i think about what other people think of me or if there laughing or making fun of me i really don t i don t even try to think like this but it happens to the point where my thoughts overwhelm me when i m trying to make a critical decision like for example if i m overwhelmed and someone is asking me a yes or no question when i want to say no i get overwhelmed and say yes i hate this because i feel like i m a pushover 3 depending on what clothing i wear i feel exposed for example i like wearing baggy clothes if i wear a regular shirt i constantly think something is wrong with the shirt or there s a stain on it or he she is looking at me is there something wrong with it 4 i m more nervous when i m in a new environment and more reluctant to do something that i ve never done before like go to a new restaurant but if i m somewhere that i ve been too repetitively at first i m uncomfortable anxious but then i get over the anxiety over time whenever there s a pause when someone is talking or if i m waiting for something in a public space i either just look at my nails or look down 5 the weirdest problem when i m either in or just leaving a social situation my heart is beating so fast and i feel this weird almost pain like feeling in my chest i have no idea why but it happens _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ there are more issues that i think are problematic but i don t want to write a whole essay so i just put my biggest problems i don t want to offend anyone i just genuinely want to find answers because i m broke and can t afford therapy to find out why i have these issues not only this but i just feel like it s not just oh your just shy or you will get over it it s been almost 5 years since i ve had this problem,social_anxiety

1pjs3p4,im so bad at forming sentences that someone else had to interpret what i said to my group in class so i was put in a group of four in class and i had to ask my group some discussion questions and i ended up messing up my question like the grammar and the order of the words my group member got confused by what i said so someone else had to explain what i was asking to the group in a more understandable way and of course i have no problem with that but not going to lie i felt really dumb and stupid like i just spoke in an alien language or some shit english is literally my native language yet im struggle so bad at forming a simple sentence or expressing my thoughts and feelings through words even when explaining simple topics i end up saying 5 confusing sentences that can be explained concisely in like 1 sentence its kind of frustrating sometimes i feel like theres something lacking in my brain because it seems like im so slow all the time i really want to learn how to improve articulating myself,social_anxiety

1pjoa0z,getting out of my shell in a festive way mixed feelings i m a 21 year old dude in uni making friends has always been nerve wracking for me but every major holiday for a few years i ve found a way to force myself to start conversations with new people this year i made christmas bags for almost everyone in my dorm there was some hot chocolate candy canes other miscellaneous treats i was able to hand them all out tonight and it was really fun the good parts: one guy gave me a hug and said he was grateful another group invited me into their dorm and we played videogames and talked about naruto for a while another guy exchanged numbers with me and we re gonna go play pickleball when it gets warmer it was nice to see everybody so happy i feel like i was able to make some real connections i enjoyed putting all the bags together meeting some really cool dogs and seeing everyone s christmas decorations the not as good parts: some people seemed really creeped out by me i don t know i guess it s sorta intimidating to have a guy knock on your apartment door after 6pm but i didn t really have any other times to get it done i was pretty jealous of how well other roommates seemed to get along and how well their apartments were decorated my new roommates are much better than my old ones but they haven t been very receptive to hanging out overall i m glad i did it i ve been working so hard this semester to get out of my shell it s a new city i don t have any friends here yet and i think 4 months of effort have finally started to pay off hopefully i can get a group of friends together soon i d love to have a group study sesh or make gingerbread houses that s kinda my dream it s still really hard i work full time and it s finals week hard not to get discouraged despite my successes but i m glad i wrote it down here it helps me be grateful,social_anxiety

1pjlcsc,do you ever feel social anxiety has killed your personality at my core i m witty and goofy and it s my favorite thing about myself but my social anxiety has gotten so severe i feel i ve lost all of my personality at work i can hardly think of anything to say and will often be quiet for hours while all my colleagues chat with each other when i do talk my voice gets shakey and no one listens to me or they just talk over me i can never think of a single joke during the conversation when i was once so witty and i feel like my colleagues think i m the most monotone boring person on earth and it makes me so sad only my mom and sister know my funny and fun side can anyone relate,social_anxiety
1pjl7yq,do you also feel that your pain is invisible feeling down tonight i ve come a long way from the worst of my social anxiety that happened in my teens now i have a degree and a job where i regularly have to talk to people things that were unthinkable a few years ago despite that i think i will never get over the lack of social interaction during vital formative years i carry a huge hollowness inside of me social anxiety is something that my life revolves around it heavily defined who i am as a person and yet i feel like there s still stigma that keeps me from talking about it to people you can t talk about it in casual conversation because you ll both ruin the mood and look like a loser can t easily talk about it to a potential friend or date because what if they decide it s a red flag or look down on you no one in my family acknowledges it either when i touch the subject with my parents they feel guilty and i feel bad it s like wherever i go there s this huge elephant in the room that we re all looking at and willfully ignoring interact with any normal person and they ll usually have tales and experiences to share about their teens and 20s and i have to be reminded of the huge decade long blank in the timeline of my life but not talk about it because it would ruin the vibe i feel pressure to act like i m normal when i m anything but this disorder is my skin and bones i was formed by it and when i can t be open about it i feel like i m in hiding like people don t actually know me it s just so lonely do you guys also feel that way how do you deal with it,social_anxiety

1pjice4,i ve finally started to feel like me again i consider myself a somewhat social person but i don t really hang out with people as much as i used to i got out of an extremely toxic relationship just shy of two years ago and it affected me a lot more than i let on he was controlling manipulative and shattered my self confidence it got to the point where i just stopped doing anything because whatever i did he would get mad at and whatever i didn t do he would get mad about that i lost good friends because of him i managed to recover and reconcile some of those relationships but i was never able to cross the hurdle of meeting people in person again i was suddenly consumed by this fear that something terrible would happen to me that they d somehow someway hurt me too naturally i went to therapy to help myself get out of this box i stuffed myself in i won t say i m 100 good but lately i ve had a couple of victories after class i ll hang out with a friend at the library or get something to eat with them between classes i also made it a point to keep in touch with people even if they live far away so if the moment were to ever arise then we could meet up i also joined a discord gaming server where everyone is pretty chill i ve made a ton of great friends there who welcomed me immediately and talk to every day we play games together have conversations about literally anything and sometimes do movie nights i m so happy to say that i m starting to feel like my old self again i feel so loved where i am and that i don t feel as afraid anymore to just walk up to someone and make conversation some family members have gotten on me about not being very social and that it makes me weird but i m comfortable with the slow progress i m making,social_anxiety

1pjefhl,anyone else here pretty socially perceptive i was thinking about something today i was watching these videos of psychopaths diagnosed psychopaths talking and then i read the comment section and a lot of people really bought into it and i do get why one person in particular talked in a very jovial tone almost jokey a lot of the time he comes across as likeable of course if you know your psychology you know that psychopaths in reality are rarely the cold husks that tv likes to show rather a core part of the diagnosis is superficial charm and glibness so his tone was one thing but everything else was manipulative he would constantly subtly reframe the topic like when asked about trust he would reframe it first as being about reliability which allowed him to talk about himself positively he would always do that too start off very positive then sprinkle in some negatives while at the same time downplaying them talking about things as i never intended harm and it was just ribbing or i m just a thrill seeker or saying things like others say this to make it seem subjective or subtly shifting the blame he also constantly avoided discussing any details about his behaviour always speaking in vagueries like me and my brother went thrill seeking and often omitting key details i noticed all of this very easily and yet based on the comment section this guy had a lot of people convinced he really was a decent guy i also remember this time when in high school there was this new girl in class i don t remember exactly what i noticed but i remember noticing the first day she was there that she seemed untrustworthy i think part of it is that i felt an underlying coldness in her regardless of what she was actually saying my then best friend decided to date her and found out unfortunately that she was not a great person i still regret not telling him about my suspicions but i felt they were based on so little and i didn t want to sabotage what might ve been a good thing or another friend of mine he met a girl and within idk 10 minutes of talking to her i immediately noticed a bunch of red flags but again i didn t want to get in between and sabotage something potentially good and once again things turned out similarly and there have been a bunch of times where when i feel my anxiety spike in certain high stakes social situations i often don t trust myself and in the past i have often contacted my psychologist to ask her advice on what i should do but what i noticed is that a lot of the time i am better at predicting the person s reaction than she is obviously i m closer to the situation so that definitely helps but the point is i tend not to trust my own judgement when it comes to social situations like at all but objectively speaking i seem to be pretty good at it i can t shake the uncertainty though i never trust what i think or say or think of doing i m always scared it ll be wrong,social_anxiety

1pj9q8e,social anxiety at workplace i m not sure if i can call it social anxiety but that s how i feel about it at least i always feel super anxious and fast heartbeats when i get invited to a meeting at work especially with high profile personnels primary reason being is that i m not that good at conversational english so i always assume that the person i m talking to will criticize me in his head so i end up forgetting words having broken sentences get more anxious not just that but when someone asks me what do you do at work i don t have structured thoughts and i feel thoughts are scattered in my mind i really don t know what to do or how to treat it i also can t open up to my manager about this fearing that he she will perceive me as a week person and i might lose my opportunity to get promoted to a manager role what is the best practice to fix myself,social_anxiety

1pj2dkx,how to reject going to a work lunch the company i work for is winding down for the year and our boss offered to take the office out for a fancy lunch at a 5 star restaurant i told them i wouldn t be able to go because of my dietary restrictions and the restaurant doesn t accommodate i m honestly relieved because i was dreading going to this lunch now the problem: my supervisor feels bad that i m staying behind while everyone else goes out and leaves early he said he ll take me out next week to make up for it but i really don t want to go i m extremely socially awkward and the idea of a one on one lunch is even worse than the group lunch my supervisor and i only discuss work and nothing more we don t have that casual rapport i don t want to sit through a meal trying to make conversation while feeling anxious and i don t want him feeling pressured to fill the silence either i feel more comfortable not talking but i know most people get uncomfortable with that i want to politely decline without offending him or making him think i m ungrateful i d rather spare us both the awkward lunch any advice edit: i tried declining but he insists saying it would be unfair i asked for the day off but was denied,social_anxiety

1pizn82,group settings are impossible for me to open up in hi 29m here and i struggle a lot with opening up in group settings this has been a recurring theme in my life and i m at a loss with what to do with this issue as it s to the point of being debilitating it s a fairly similar script every time i go to an event or gathering with others i show up at my most confident ready to socialize and it takes about one awkward interaction or one conversational topic that i don t feel capable of contributing in to completely deflate my confidence these small things can trigger me to retreat almost entirely into my shell to the point of being non verbal i suppose this post is me venting and opening up in hopes others have similar experiences or some kind of advice to offer this particular dynamic is sooo confronting and hard to even know where to begin thanks for reading and much love to others who can relate and also those who cannot,social_anxiety

1pixbpf,social anxiety coming back after stopping medication i have had pretty severe social anxiety disorder my whole life last year i was prescribed lexapro which basically eliminated all my anxiety it was incredible however my memory became terrible i had very bad brain fog all the time and i had no more motivation or ambition so i decided to stop taking 3 months ago as it was affecting my performance in college i was fine at first and the brain fog cleared up a little bit but recently my anxiety has been flaring up a lot now i become physically very panicked around certain people i now have to hype myself up to do something very simple like walking into a classroom when i didn t even need to think about it before once my wellbutrin runs out i take it twice a day my body just enters flight mode and then my mind follows it even if i m completely alone i ruminate over past events constantly to the point where studying is nearly impossible at times so i m in a bit of a dilemma i can t go back to the lexapro as it destroyed my memory and ability to focus be present which i still am recovering from i m also a pilot and i m not legally allowed to fly while taking two antidepressants at once i really don t know what to do i haven t felt this way in nearly a year so i feel like these symptoms are hitting me much harder than before i don t know how to function without anxiety medication advice,social_anxiety

1piutsn,what kind of people trigger your social anxiety not as in how they treat you or whether you know them but just purely based on who they are like demographics or status for me it s white guys i d run into them at the grocery store and gotten so shy that i turned around or walked to another aisle to wait until they left before coming back i didn t even see their faces it feels like such a sensitive topic not sure if my ex being a white guy has anything to do with it i need to decondition myself,social_anxiety
1piu3dh,does it ever go away i have pushed myself out of my comfort zone so many times that pretty much everyone who has met me thinks i m not afraid of anything people think i m confident because i can dance at clubs alone attend large concerts alone eat at restaurants alone etc little do they know that the reason i can overcome anxiety to do those big things is because i get anxiety about everything for me the anxiety i get from getting gas is equivalent to going to a concert alone i get anxious going to the grocery store walking down the sidewalk etc pretty much anything outside my bedroom is outside my comfort zone people have told me for years that continuing to get outside my comfort zone will help me but so far that has not worked i get more comfortable in certain situations insofar as i get familiar with the specific location and my route there but if it s say going through a drive thru line in a new city then it s back to square one i want to be confident doing things in places i haven t been to not just be confident in my bubble even better would be to do new things in places i haven t been to and embarrassing myself and realizing it s not that bad to embarrass yourself has not helped either i have some seriously embarrassing moments especially from when i was younger ive crashed an e bike into a pole going 30 mph in front of 50 people i went to a high school party with people i barely knew and really admired drank too much and had a meltdown so bad they called cps can t make that shit up i once accidentally texted my crush who did not like me back a screenshot from my diary talking about their best qualities which i d meant to send to my friend a guy once stole my phone opened my gallery found a video of me dancing in my underwear and showed his friends once while walking down the sidewalk amongst a bunch of guys i stepped over a vent and my dress flew straight up into my face i also have the socially awkward experiences which sucked like eating alone in the cafeteria i am grateful i ll never have to return to that again but none of that has really helped me it all still feels exactly the same the one thing that does help is if i m looking my best have my hair done wearing nice clothes groomed etc but i don t want to feel like i can only go outside and do things if i ve spent half an hour beautifying myself i don t care that i can do things that i have the ability to physically go outside it would be nice if it felt good as well does it ever go away,social_anxiety

1pip095,ghosting silence i am writing to share an observation about business networking that has been causing me some concern and anxiety as a business owner i have been in business and sales for 20 years over the past two years i have noticed a marked shift in professional communication and engagement especially regarding networking individuals including those i have done business with for years are suddenly becoming extremely difficult to reach often disappearing or not responding to communications it appears that many people particularly employees within larger corporations are doing the bare minimum and are reluctant to develop or expand relationships getting any response from established contacts now feels like fighting tooth and nail which is a new and consistent pattern i ve noticed with dozens of people not just an odd few this trend is creating significant anxiety for me as a business owner i would appreciate any insight or advice you might have on how to overcome this challenge and adapt my networking strategies to the current environment i feel like it stifling growth and positivity it s almost like an attitude of i don t give a f anymore i ve had some friends over the last few years act in a similar way so if a common trend across different parts of life thank you for your time and perspective best,social_anxiety

1pijsj7,do i want friends or do i just want them because everyone tells me i should i ve recently been wondering if i really want friends i only have one friend and i barely see him but it doesn t bother me that much if i think about it not having friends wasn t even a problem for me until high school when my parents and teachers started insisting i should have friends i never cared but from then on they really started pushing it and they still do it wasn t such a big deal for me until they made me realize i was doing something wrong i don t know i often think that half of my concern about never socializing is because i feel pressured to not because i m actually interested or excited about it whenever i think about putting myself in situations where i have to make friends i feel terrible i don t want to and i m not interested in the slightest but i still feel pressured like if i don t i m living my life the wrong way and it makes me think that s probably why all my social interactions go badly because i go around with the predisposition to be liked and make friends when in reality i m not even interested that s why i put in so much effort and get so nervous and when i see things go wrong i get disappointed even though i have no interest in getting anything out of it i m at home and i feel bad for not being out there making friends and living life but then when i do i have a bad time and i just want to be at home i think i m simply chasing social achievements that i couldn t care less about and that only cause me problems it s true that i want to improve socially in other areas like walking down the street without overthinking or being able to be in a public place without anxiety but otherwise i m not interested and i m just suffering for no reason what do you think,social_anxiety

1pif3co,do you also obsess over most irrelevant things and get caught into the loop of overthinking once my therapist told me that having social anxiety is like having ocd you obsess over smallest and most irrelevant things and keep overthinking over the same irrelevant things until you get something much more irrelevant to think about and it keeps you in loop of endless thoughts excessive overthinking and you can t figure out anything from this as the thing itself is so irrelevant that nothing meaningful could be understood no matter how much you think about it so try to just realise that i can t let myself go into an endless loop of overthinking over most irrelevant things he told me that whenever you get into this loop just take a moment to realise that i m overthinking about something so irrelevant and just write that this is irrelevant and stop yourself from overthinking ny just making yourself remember that the thought and thing itself is irrelevant,social_anxiety

1pi8rkl,no one warned me how bad social anxiety gets once you become an adult since being quiet and obedient is often praised during childhood many kids and even their parents if they pay attention at all don t realize how serious social anxiety can be until it s too late more often than not social anxiety is dismissed as simply being introverted when in reality you can be extroverted and socially anxious at the same time it s only when you become an adult and start thinking about your career and future that reality hits the mild loneliness you felt from having no friends or being left out in school suddenly turns into a very real threat to your life it can affect everything from your job to relationships and your overall experience of living you don t just fail at small things the accumulated setbacks frustrations and missed opportunities gradually snowballs until eventually it feels like you re failing at life which can further lead to other mental health issues like depression yet social anxiety is still poorly understood compared to other mental disorders people assume you can simply snap out of it or just talk to people and make friends and they often treat you as if you are a creep or some lesser being when you show symptoms of social anxiety,social_anxiety
1pi7u3c,why do teenagers in public bully me so much i m 20 yo ftm with autism yesterday as i got onto a bus these people were saying ladies first idk if it were about me or one of the females i remember a girl sitting on the same bench as me without my permission she looked as though she belonged to the girls on the bench right next to where i was sat and while on the bus they were making fun of me for wanting to keep my ticket the first and second examples count as what i call clullying e g a portmandeau of bullying and clocking it s as painful as both bullying and misgendering combined but not as offensive as sexual harrassment especially if the trans person victim happens to be asexual it is basically the act of making fun of a transgender person for exhibiting traits associated with their birth sex causing both embarrassment and dysphoria today when i walked into b m someone jokingly said my bad as i walked past them because they were slow and another person yelled coca cola because they saw me eating a chocolate flavoured protein bar this is so traumatic why does it occur so frequently,social_anxiety
1pi52k5,what to do during lunch at work when i first joined my job i used to have lunch in the break room where everyone else is having lunch but it was so akward especially with everyone being loud and talkative i don t know what to say add to the conversation and i sometimes get comments about being quiet or why aren t you saying anything then i started having lunch at 12pm to make sure no one is in the break room but sometimes someone is and it s akward so i started not having lunch at all sometimes i have a snack at my desk not allowed to have lunch but a snack at the desk sometimes i go to the mcdonald s next door i enjoy going there alot because i can just pop my earphones in and watch something without pressure or distractions but i can t go to mcdonald s very often because it isn t healthy not having lunch has made me feel tired throughout the day and also wastes my 1 hour break what can i do during this hour does anyone have any suggestions especially since i need to eat i m not sure if giving into it is bad i do plan on getting professional help but it needs time,social_anxiety
1pi4ljg,is it worth it to be diagnosed 20f uk ive struggled with debilitating social anxiety my entire life i mostly struggle making friends being around new people and public speaking i struggle with public speaking the most and i cant even present something if it s just 1 other person in the room there was a time a few years ago that i couldn t leave the house because i didn t even want to walk past people in the street its mentally exhausting and in my course i have 2 presentations at the least coming up and sometimes i wonder if it would be good to be on some sort of medication or behaviour therapy to try and stop this because everyday i mourn the person i could be without this weighing me down it controls my life would appreciate any advice regarding going to the dr s or any methods to get over this,social_anxiety

1pi38y0,working in fast food i wanted to hop on here to see if i could get any advice from an outside perspective because i feel like i m not always thinking clearly due to extreme social anxiety i have worked at 1 other fast food place in the past for almost 6 months and now i am working at tim hortons which has been fine but extremely stressful for me i want to first explain the context of my social anxiety first off like almost anyone else i want friends and seek social relationships i just struggle making conversation and my body overreacts to social situations and my heart races etc it s not that im stuck up in any way i just struggle to come up with things to say and have sort of an off putting energy about me which is fine i ve learned to just accept it and keep practicing the main reason i m writing this is because after 3 weeks of working in fast food again i am really really struggling with my anxiety and when i wake up i cry every single day and when i get home i cry some more mostly as a way to release all the built up emotions after being treated like crap at work by mainly customers but also sometimes coworkers for not being fast or good enough still training by the way haven t been taught everything yet i m trying my hardest and i guess that s a good thing but it s becoming too much for me seeing as i don t want to be stuck in fast food forever i need to find a career option asap i might be being dramatic but this industry kills my soul and i really need something better where i don t have to talk or socialize all the time it s exhausting i feel stuck because i feel like most careers are built for people who are extremely social and able to easily fake their emotions and personality that s just not me though and i need something that s a right fit for me,social_anxiety
1pi33ly,tutorial on eye contact questions hi i have really bad social anxiety and i can not even look near someones face im not sure exactly why i had a lot of symptoms of autism but even without the autism i have diagnosed social anxiety and in general im a very shy person so autism or not i still have no clue how to do eye contact im curious on if people like it or not like when someones giving you eye contact do you feel like that person is more warm or do you feel like theyre more intimidating should you smile while doing eye contact or nope which type of smile should you do like a gentle one or a bigger one how long should you hold the eye contact do i glance every few seconds or do i stay looking does the longer the eye contact the more connected two people are how do you feel if someone doesnt give any eye contact at all generally im extremely focused with what people are saying and i reply to every single thing but i just act busy because i cant look people in the eye or even near their face so they arent offended ive been told to try to look at their nose or something but again it doesnt help me personally because looking near them makes me uncomfortable id like to change this so i can make friends easier but im wondering if its a requirement or not and i really wanted to hear from some actual humans that are gen z or whatever instead of websites or chatgpt or anything because i cant trust what they think i need to hear from people personally thank youu 3,social_anxiety
1pi2cml,i do it to myself we re having a secret santa party at my job in a few weeks today we all drew names and i was happy with who i chose because we get along well enough so it wouldn t be too hard to find her a gift i know she likes taylor swift reading and fruity candies so i m planning on getting her a gift bag containing cheap little trinkets and items that revolve around those things i ve been lightly brainstorming over it for the past couple hours and it just hit me that i m putting so much effort into getting gifts that involve her likes and interests when i probably won t get the same treatment in return because no one at my job knows anything about me in return my anxiety makes me really closed off and i don t really talk much about myself in general my coworkers are really nice and have made efforts to get to know me before but my social skills suck so the conversation never makes it that far it s even become a bit of a joke i once told to my manager that i really like classic rock and when she mentioned it again in a conversation with some other coworkers a couple days later they were all super surprised that she managed to find out something about me they were all super shocked they kept asking her how she managed to find that out about me i ve worked there for over 2 years something like that should be basic knowledge by now but i m so reserved that it was like they uncovered some deep dark secret or something i ll probably end up getting a generic gift like a candle or a gift card which is fine and i m greatful regardless but it would ve been nice if i could ve gotten a present actually based on who i am and what i enjoy doing i have no one else to blame for it but myself though :,social_anxiety
1pi29jb,this situation is getting stressful is there anyone who feels constantly awkward in social interactions like me whether it s a friend a relative a colleague or a stranger i can never be completely calm and relaxed when speaking and expressing myself i can t just talk i can t act silly for the sake of it i can t tell a funny story i can t talk to someone for long without slurring my words losing my train of thought forgetting things and panicking i feel weird the only time i can speak in a steady natural flow is when i m at the therapist s probably because i m in a safe environment where i don t fear judgment every other time however it s torture my movements become mechanical and wooden my thoughts become confused my brain starts analyzing everything this makes me feel terrible because i feel like i can t truly connect with other human beings it pains me to see two people happily conversing and having a good time together it makes me feel wrong i m not saying i never have pleasant moments with my friends or that i never have fun but this constant feeling of unease lives inside me i can t figure out how to fix this or if i should just accept it i can t figure out if it s related to my mood or how i ve trained my brain to experience social interactions i don t know guys this isn t the first post i ve made on reddit about this problem i just want to feel free to just be without a little voice in my head telling me you re doing well or you re doing badly i hope i made myself clear i needed to vent sorry,social_anxiety
1pi15of,worse anxiety in mornings does anyone else have worse anxiety in the morning vs later in the day it s still pretty severe anxiety either way but there s a noticeable difference for me between anxiety during early morning later in the day and especially at night often towards the end of the day i ll start planning the next day ways i can improve and things like that but when morning comes that task seems 10 times harder now even if its hours away if it s anything requiring being social it will most likely not happen or be rushed through if it s during the morning,generalized_anxiety

1phxuls,i have everything i just don t know how to communicate good evening this is a real rant and i know it may seem like a minor problem to some but for me it s getting more complicated every day i m very happy with my life currently i passed medicine at a competitive college in brazil i m studying i got a body that i fought for years to have i m taking care of my appearance i made more friends i learned new hobbies i started living alone i get dates i ve been seeking god i m very happy with the direction of my life it s not much but it s honest work however a problem that has haunted me for some time constantly comes back to affect me and manages to distract me from all the advances in my life: communication i hate how i express myself i feel like i sound too desperate in my words i scream when i want to talk i talk when i want to scream i stumble a lot when speaking there are times when i talk too much seem desperate for attention and can t adapt to the tone of the moment other times i feel too out of place and i also seem desperate agreeing with everything and laughing for nothing my voice is very semitone i express myself in a very expansive way and it seems like i can t control it i simply can t be too serious i have to make a joke or do some self deprecation public speaking fuck i m going to shake like a green stick even in my own friendships and relationships i feel that this difficulty in expressing myself or simply having control over it affects our bond i ve even heard from other people indirectly that i m forced fit in and weird i feel terrible about this despite all the advances this part of mine seems to be going backwards modestly it s horrible to be the size i am i m about 90kgs and communicate looking like a capuchin monkey or i m always the clown remembered but little taken seriously or i m the guy who s just there agreeing and i don t make any difference i ve never dated and i can t see myself dating i m already a psychologist who helped me accept myself better and dealt with a lot of insecurities and currently i don t run away from any fight i always go out of my way to present something i worked on have the simplest small talk and go on a party with new people even if i get home extremely distressed and with a feeling of failure but it simply doesn t get better if anyone is going through something similar or knows the best thing to do i would be very grateful for the help or dialogue we can have,social_anxiety

1ph3t82,dea have social anxiety but no one believes you i am someone who implodes instead of explodes so when in feeling extreme social anxiety it usually is an internal shut down not and external melt down and it also tends to manifest in a lot of intrusive thoughts that either prevent me from engaging in a social situation or send my flight response into overdrive because my symptoms are relatively easy to hide if no ones paying attention shakiness weakness cold sweats increased heartrate difficulty breathing scatter thoughts ect i dont think anyone who knows me would believe me if i told them i do pretty well in group settings when theres clear common ground ill just let the others do the talking and add stuff when i need to but the farther outside of my comfort zone the worse the symptoms i usually find a way to leave a situation before it gets bad the most annoying thing is even when im not in a situation where i feel intense panic with every interaction i feel underlying anxiety and insecurity constantly having intrusive thoughts and over analyzing every interaction the slightest perceived neutral negative response has me second guessing my entire existence and self worth ill be laughing with a coworker and then if they dont laugh at the next thing i say im convinced they think im the most annoying person they know and hate having to work with me i always read into whats not said and i hate it i hate it so much that i ve mastered hiding how insecure i am behind a smile and now i hate that im reaching my lowest point and i dont think anyone will believe me and therefor wont take me seriously if i ask for help,social_anxiety

1ph0oov,why i cant speak idk if anyone is going to read all this but im just gonna list all the reasons why i barely speak at school or in other places especially in groups even in my own friend group not that close to everyone in it only close to like 2 people also plz dont be mean im posting this to know if anyone else relates and for advice again plz be respectful when giving advice the reasons: fear of embarrassing myself by saying the wrong thing or the person im talking to ends up being a jackass and then they show negative reactions such as silence or even a slightly judgmental mean comment and if its in a group it would be even more embarrassing scared because im terrible with words and just simply trying to speak makes me forget what the fuck i was going to say i don t want to awkwardly stutter and forget what i was going to say in front of someone and also like i just cant form my thoughts into words im terrible at speaking for a long time lol like even with essays like i just cant put my thoughts into words so i just use chatgpt ik its bad everyone is typing so fast and i haven t even wrote my thesis yet fear of my voice being too quiet and i keep repeating their name over and over to get their attention but they don t hear me but then someone else next to me heard me continuing to repeat their name and observed me and then it gets so fucking awkward and i awkwardly stop calling their name i hate when people observe me when something awkward happens to me my voice getting stuck because my throat is dehydrated and i always have to clear it and even when i clear it it still cracks sometimes also i just cant bring myself to speak cuz i just feel like my voice is completely gone and there s like a huge force thats stopping me from taking action and speaking fear of people not listening to me cause my voice is too quiet and so they give up trying to listen or they get distracted by something else in the middle of me speaking and on top of that someone else observes this happening and then i feel so fucking awkward and stop talking this is why i never speak in long sentences when im talking to someone in public fear of finally starting to talk after a long time of not really talking in the group so its fucking awkward because like theyre not used to me talking so once i finally like speak up they re weirded out they might even show a weird reaction like silence or say stupid shit like no one asked you you barely even talk in the group or another weird comment fear of sounding confrontational and angry when i slightly raise my voice so i therefore don t talk at all cuz the only way i can talk is talk quietly but if i speak quietly they wont hear so therefore i don t speak at all like i just really can t find a middle ground in my voice volume fear of other people observing me while im speaking to someone they might judge my words my body language my awkward way of speaking i cant keep a conversation going because im so anxious and focused on how i appear and again im terrible with words so nothing comes up in my head everyone is constantly talking and i don t know how to join in the convo i feel like i ll interrupt and it will feel awkward fear of people getting mad at me,social_anxiety
1ph0bix,advice please im 16 years old and started a new school 2 months ago now ive spent the last 3 years of my life constantly skipping school each day and wandering around the city without talking to anyone or making friends and when i d come home i d stay in my room and never speak to anyone my parents applied me to schools over the 3 years and i got into a new one maybe a year into skipping but that didn t turn out well and i just started skipping again after the 2 week break leading to me losing all friends i had there and being socially outcasted the application to my current school wasn t being responded to after months so i decided to go in in person and ask what was going on leading to them reapplying me and a few weeks later getting in it s supposed to be a laid back adult learning experience similar to college where you can choose your own schedule and when you want and don t want to do work usually students come in a few days a week for a few hours but i wanted to come in daily for the full 6 hours for the first couple weeks i couldn t bring myself to talk to anyone i met there there was a large friend group in the school who all seemed really cool to me and one of them was especially approachable so one day i started talking to them and we had a lot of similar interests and the week later we spent like 4 hours hanging out after school and we got pretty close then after that i was more willing to open up to the others of the group and i ended up getting close with another two people i was close enough with 3 of the 8 to stay at their houses when my own living situation was getting rocky and two of them visited me when i was put in the psych ward for a week i really like these guys and want to be friends with them so bad and they say they re my friends but i don t feel it whenever we talk i m the one to message first none of them have ever messaged me first whenever they tell me something they include they already told someone else first they all have friends other than me that they prioritize over me and i can t stop feeling sick to my stomach jealous over it everyone has someone else and i have nobody like that it doesn t matter what they tell me when were together because i never feel it s true one of them told me about how they re only faking being optimistic because of how pessimistic i am and they re not as happy a person they come off to be because they say they don t have any friends and they re glad i m their friend then they go a week not showing up to school and when i message them they don t respond how can you say im the only friend you ve had in ages that you really care about and love but then not talk to me i see you re online i see you posting on your story i know you re talking to other people and i m being ignored i spent 3 years alone and now that i have friends it s the worst time of my life because i cant be as important to them as they are to me i feel expendable and when i am with them i feel like i m taking up time they could be spending with people they actually care about and i m scared they ll leave me because i m really just a shallow unsociable person and when i m not putting on my loud flamboyant act i feel like they ll ditch me after realising i m nobody special i deactivated my instagram a few days ago to stop myself from messaging them then spending the day checking if they re online and airing me i want to talk to them about this but i dont want to sound like i m guilt tripping them into talking to me more none of them have reached out on other platforms we have each other added on about my instagram being gone so that makes me feel even better sorry if i sounded selfish or whiney through this but i really need advice on what to do,social_anxiety

1pgw6h2,my thought hi everybody today while spending some time with my nephew and his little friends something really struck me watching them grow up in this fast moving world of technology made me realise how much things have changed especially for the generation we now call gen alpha and gen beta it feels like somewhere along the way we ve stopped letting our children truly open their minds and i m not blaming anyone maybe as parents or future parents we all want our kids to be safe to never face what we once faced to never feel the pain we felt but i ve also seen how this turns into overprotection a child cries and everything is placed in front of them instantly no waiting no thinking no learning if we never let our children feel small struggles how will they ever understand effort patience or even basic survival instincts sometimes i think about how our grandparents lived they grew up farming cultivating their own crops raising cows and buffaloes not as pets but as part of life and responsibility kids used to take cattle for grazing help their parents in the fields and learn through real experiences they built relationships with neighbours and relatives because life naturally connected everyone but today it feels different we are drifting into a world where we don t even know who our neighbours are not their names not their families not their struggles technology was meant to change the world but it has also started changing the human inside the world maybe some people call this freedom maybe some feel it s modern living but personally i don t know i just feel something important is slipping away connection community resilience and the simple understanding of life i d really like to hear your thoughts on this what do you think,generalized_anxiety

1pgf9pz,23f my take on social anxiety hello everyone finding this and reading the first few post has really made me feel like i m not the only one who is struggling and the fact that having social anxiety isn t taken seriously from others who don t have it i m glad this exist because i don t have to try to explain myself repeatedly to people and expect them to understand social anxiety has affected most my life until now and although i m improving little by little i have come this far to have steady and secure conversation about it as i know i m not the only one who struggles with overthinking and i think it comes with social anxiety which is honestly frustrating because not only it affects on you but others that you have in your life i ve had moments in my dark days that i felt like i m going insane and that i m being unheard as i am in relationship right now and healthy one too and if i m being honest we all know being in relationship can be hard because of what we have but what i am grateful about is that i was able to push myself to talk to people and that was on a app that looks like a live stream or public vc for people you can meet online of course i was scared as i often just stay in the comments section but when i met the right person to talk to and this was all from quarantine so even tho i felt shaky this person didn t even take notice and just treated me like everyone else my point is even though social anxiety can be isolating and prevent from doing this you deserve and to accomplish things doesn t mean it s impossible a simple hi and smile can go a long way but even though it didn t go to plan you achieve something even though it s small you got this,social_anxiety

1pgawgw,what are your thoughts on my situation i went out and all that was mainly on my mind was what if i am doing something wrong or i shouldn t be doing this it in a shop setting now what i mean by this is an example from today was whether i was allowed to use the elevator by how it says only used by employees if a evacuation is needed and seeing at the same time that no one was using at all and i am being watched by the employees i basically overthink too much when i am in public based on my movements and how i present myself it s so hard it s basically something like the example i have given and internal dialogue of i hope i am perceiving myself okay or if some stranger gives me a weird look or an expression that makes me feel i am doing something wrong i would keep myself small and don t do it again as how strangers perceive me or if seem okay in how i am functioning affects me the most i would gratefully appreciate anyone s input on this,social_anxiety
1pg9sx3,being excluded they hate me idk if this is necessarily a question okay so i have a decent friend group online that i play games with frequently i don t talk to many people irl to be honest i m too anxious and insecure so playing games and talking with people is really the majority of my socialization because i can control my image i can calculate what i m saying before i say it but whenever i m not included in something my friends are doing my brain automatically goes to them purposefully not inviting me gossiping talking shit about me behind my back saying how annoying i am and especially the whole he thinks he s our friend but we just tolerate him thing i know realistically this probably isn t the case but i can t stop myself from spiraling in a similar sense i will drop everything to join in because i m scared of missing out or only being available after everyone else left i ll skip meals i won t get off until everyone else has i ll sacrifice sleep staying up til 12 2am even if i have school at 6am or work the next day tldr: self destructive fomo how do i stop myself from spiraling,social_anxiety
1pg9nnq,just here for support i am coming to terms with the fact that i have social anxiety i have said for years that i m not shy just introverted and that i don t care what anyone thinks when deep down i am consumed by what others might be thinking i am started to look up resources looking into therapy when my insurance kicks in and talking to family about giving up alcohol i don t drink daily but i have been drinking at social functions for years just to get through it i always over do it and have terrible anxiety after analyzing everything i did and might have did it s been hard talking to family about my plans to manage this i m sure everyone has heard just stop worrying so much and who cares what they think and many more but i wasn t prepared for how crazy that would make me feel i keep asking myself if it should really be that easy but finding this group has given me some clarity on that since my last binge drinking at a social event which was just last night i have had crippling anxiety i feel like i just can t take it anymore i want to call everyone and apologize but people keep telling me i have nothing to apologize for i have no idea what i can do in the now to ease this feeling off my chest and out of mind i guess this is an attempt at getting some of my thoughts out,generalized_anxiety

1pg81ng,the placebo effect the placebo effect that is used to help with physical problems could also help with mental ones for instance imagine your therapist told you about a new drug that would permanently cure your social anxiety but it was actually a placebo and you didnt know it was fake you then discussed and researched about this new drug and felt very positive that it would fix your anxiety after taking it you immediately believe that your problem will be fixed and interact with others extremely well not caring if you act awkwardly because you believe the drug is making you more confident when its just your brain from what i know social anxiety is mostly caused by thought patterns and the perception that previous social interactions went badly and the fear that future social events will also be bad and it can be removed simply by not caring about being awkward and judged by others when in social situations,social_anxiety

1pfwfxw,the confusing part of improving social anxiety: not knowing who would still respect you if you slipped there s a specific confusion that comes with getting better at masking or managing social anxiety people start treating you with more respect more ease more interest and instead of feeling relieved you end up stuck with a question you can t answer: would they still treat me this way if i showed the anxious version of myself again it turns progress into a strange conflicted space you want to believe the positive reactions are genuine but part of you wonders if you re only being treated well because they assume you re confident now you can t tell whether you re finally being seen accurately or whether you re just fitting into the version of you they prefer and the harder part is wanting to know the truth without actually wanting to risk slipping back into the anxious behavior to find out so you stay caught in this loop of improvement mixed with uncertainty unsure which relationships are real and which ones rely on you keeping the vulnerable parts hidden,social_anxiety

1pfo62b,hangxiety just kind of venting really anyone else struggle socialising i find i m just really awkward until i m 3 or 4 beers in then conversation flows so much more easily i know i shouldn t rely on alcohol for courage i just can t seem to function in a social situation without it finding conversation dries up really quickly and then just awkward silence the main problem is i then get carried away and almost to make up for not being able to speak to people normally i then want to talk to absolutely everyone usually in the early hours of the morning which then leads to not remembering who i ve spoken to or what i ve said resulting in multiple days of being an absolute anxious mess other than the obvious don t drink anyone found anything that helps i already take meds for anxiety and depression which help the day to day but definitely not social events and it s that time of the year again anyway cheers for reading,social_anxiety
1pfo1dj,my brother will be getting married soon and i m afraid to attend the wedding what can i do to prepare me 22f and my brother 25m are not super close but we re not on bad terms either we re at a check in once in a while but know that i love you relationship needless to say i want to be there on his wedding day because i understand that they re important most of my family and my fsil s future sister in law family are aware that i have social anxiety i ve struggled with it since i was 13 something as little as going to a restaurant with 5 other people can be overwhelming so the thought of a wedding is scary i haven t been directly asked to be anything in the wedding best man maid of honour whose giving my fsil away have all been chosen bridesmaids are be discussed i m happy to just be there not having a duty helps as i won t be expected to do anything that might be difficult but there s still a chance i may be asked to be a bridesmaid weddings are loud there will be a lot of people yes some people i know but that factor doesn t make a huge difference when anxiety flairs up i want to be there for both my brother and my fsil but sometimes i m able to tell if my anxiety will flair up and i know it will at the wedding it s a side note to mention that we lost someone in our family recently and their absence from the wedding will definitely be felt grief is extremely hard to push down and it has triggered my anxiety on occasion a part of me is expecting that closer to the date my mother may ask me if i want to go at all in a genuine way i want to be strong and to be there for them but it s a terrifying prospect i don t want to be closed off in a corner pretending i can t be seen by anyone or have to keep hiding away in a different room or outside i have my childhood plushie that i take absolutely everywhere with me as it s the single best thing that grounds me when i get flair ups but i m aware of how ridiculous i may seem as an adult clutching a toy for dear life at a wedding i really don t know what to do i want to show that i care about this for both my brother and fsil but i can t deny i m terrified either,social_anxiety
1pfndgq,my social anxiety is absolutely destroying my life my social anxiety has reached a dangerous level and i don t know what to do i m in school and i can only chat with my desk mate i can t talk to anyone else during roll call in class i even hesitate to say here what if my voice doesn t come out or the teacher doesn t hear me and asks if i m here i overthink every little thing i do for example in my course i forgot my pencil case i was even too shy to ask the people behind me if they had a spare pencil i got a pencil but the lead broke i spent two hours thinking about how to ask for a refill and then the guy behind me understood without me saying anything and handed me one and i said thanks at the beginning of the course i fell for the prettiest girl in class and developed a crush but because of my issue i couldn t imagine it going anywhere two weeks passed and despite my extreme introversion the girl found my number and confessed to me we met and started flirting but it only lasted 5 days i was the one who ended it again because it was such a weird situation: the person in front of me is super energetic social and does everything without shame meanwhile this was the first time in my life i d connected with a girl the first time i d talked to a girl for that long and i had no idea how to handle it i constantly talked to the girl through ai actually i don t know i m extremely obsessed with the past i ve experienced big events and kept bottling them all up inside everything started towards the end of 7th grade two guys fixated on me over some issue and poisoned my entire year i don t know if it s right to call it peer bullying because physically i could handle them but psychologically they put a lot of pressure on me i won t go into details or this post will get really long anyway middle school ended lgs high school entrance exam came i took it but despite going to cram school for 3 years i just winged it and left without caring maybe the best time of my life was the summer after 8th grade after all that unpleasantness when placing into high school i got into a decent place with my gpa and luckily i ended up in the same class as my childhood friend adapting was really easy whatever happened it was during the 15 day break: my friend made an unforgivable mistake and our closeness completely broke off a week later in an empty class period some unbalanced guy lit a cigar everyone took a puff i did too like everyone else and someone recorded me on video and that video became really popular both in class and at school maybe this event triggered my anxiety the most i m not sure but 9th grade ended when starting 10th grade on the first day of school i was shocked: my class had been changed for some stupid reason supposedly to balance the number of classes in the school anyway the moment i entered my new class i didn t talk to anyone even a guy in the back who was also new to the class tried really hard to be friends but it was in vain i being soulless gave no reaction for 3 weeks in my new class i didn t connect with anyone i just slept in the front row and finally thinking maybe if i go back to my old class everything will fix itself i managed to switch back with difficulty: i talked to the guidance counselor went to a psychologist and got a report talked at length with the assistant principal and somehow got back to my class now it s been almost 2 months since i switched back to my old class and school sucks the assholes in class acted like they never knew me from the beginning and didn t give a shit about my return i didn t talk to anyone either because i m introverted but somehow this situation only happens at school in courses or in any social setting however in life i have 3 real friends i can call brother who truly value me when i m with them my social anxiety drops to 0 like a whole new personality emerges straight out of tyler durden i want this not just with them but in every moment of my life i know the problem is entirely in me and the only person who can change it is me but even the smallest things seem impossible to me: saying hi to someone starting a conversation etc i don t know what to do i m sure no one will give a shit about this post but at least i m venting to real people not ai,social_anxiety

1pfj5jc,brutal realization i ve realised that i ve become too different from what most people consider normal to have a functioning social life again over the years my social skills have deteriorated so much and my interests have drifted so far from the mainstream that i feel completely out of place yesterday while reflecting on one of the few social interactions i ve had in recent years it hit me hard i couldn t connect with the person i was talking to at all you need to be someone worth getting to know but the way i am now people don t feel any reason or motivation to talk to me people sense my anxiety within seconds into the conversation and then the conversation slips away to someone safer easier more alive and i can t even blame them for it if i were in their place i d probably walk away from someone like me too social anxiety isn t just a symptom anymore it feels like it s become a defining part of me does anyone feel the same way,social_anxiety

1pffyon,social isolation has destroyed me i m cooked tl:dr this is a schizo post to rant feel free to ignore i don t expect anybody to actually read this i m just screaming into the void here and yes i m terrified of making this post on a non throwaway account but fuck it we ball i was 14 when covid hit even long before then i had started distancing myself from my peers friends and family school life wasn t about learning it was about surviving countless humiliation rituals by my peers and teachers i came home and checked out for the day waste the rest of the day on the computer or console anything but to live in reality covid was a blessing for me at least so i thought at the time i didn t have to pretend to care anymore i could disregard all of my duties relationships and even my future and so i did this of course was recognized by everyone as laziness which makes sense from an outside perspective and nobody cared not even my parents years later i would find out they knew about my struggles with social phobia but decided to do nothing out of fear that forcing me to a therapist would make things worse but i can t blame them we ve always been poor uneducated and too preoccupied with our own vices to truly care about one another i remember walking out of the graduation hall in mid 2021 having barely passed high school after hours spent in a tight packed space of people sweating and borderline unable to breathe it was a relieve going on stage wasn t as bad as i had thought it would be the lights blinded me in a way so that i couldn t see the massive crowd thank god i grabbed the graduation class photo from j and trudged my way across the parking lot to my parents and their car let s go home what sweetie don t you want to go to the graduation party i don t ever want to see any of these fucking people ever again i meant it and i haven t seen any of them since first time i swore unapologetically in front of my parents we got in the car spent half an hour driving home in complete silence well besides the pop slop playing on the radio insert any popular pop song in summer 21 quite ironic given the mood of the entire day we got home i went inside and went to bed i got up around 4pm the day before graduation it was now 3pm and i had been absolutely drained from being awake so long i had spent the last couple of days agonizing about this event in turn ruinning my sleep schedule actually i don t think i ve ever had a sleep schedule half of the days of my life i went to bed right after school to wake up in the late evening or early night and that s where i ve been since in a cycle of isolation unable to help myself out or get help i tried to become a video editor it worked for a bit till my anxiety crushed me and i ruined myself again i m isolated from the world i live in delusion i m too conscious of myself to not be afraid of anyone i bring out the trash in the middle of the night because i m terrified of being seen i avoid windows and mirrors my health will put me in the ground before 25 the thought of getting groceries is gruelling and requires a pep talk all of my clothes are old ruined or don t fit hairstylists terrify me i m unemployed and broke i reached out to two therapists both were full and told me to go to the part of the local hospital where they treat schizophrenics and suicidals dead ass that s not a joke i wish any of this was i d die there i could go on but if your reading this you get it already i m at the foot of mount everest i have to climb to the top to live but i have no climbing gear or oxygen i m cooked if anybody has read this for some reason i hope you have a good day if you have social anxiety just know there s always someone who has it worse so be hopeful in being able to fix yourself the cycle continues maybe one day i can break out and make something that ll help people like me i d like to write some books about it gonna post this and then spend the rest of my monthly internet so that i can avoid seeing replies bye,social_anxiety

1pfc4w8,fear vs discomfort in social settings lately i ve been thinking about whether there is a meaningful distinction between fear and discomfort in socially avoidant people fear is actively worrying about social situations and believing or even just feeling like things will go badly while discomfort is feeling stressed and overwhelmed in the presence of others there is large overlap between these two in most people and discomfort is an inevitable consequence of fear i make the distinction for myself because i only really experience the discomfort anymore at least to any significant degree it s so bad that i feel the need to completely distance myself from people but i don t experience any conscious fear maybe i ve just repressed the fear by emotionally isolating myself and i m afraid of being afraid again if that makes sense maybe that s what that discomfort is but i don t know anxiety is specifically about excessive fear and worrying so i m not too sure that what i have can be considered social anxiety anymore if it isn t then i don t know how to describe what s wrong with me does anyone relate to this,generalized_anxiety
1pfbmbc,how do you personally combat the fear of persecution hi everyone i have my own ways of combatting this issue it is one of my recent yet strongest aspects of social anxiety i can t enjoy public spaces without feeling of extreme judgement from everyone i think everyone is out to get me harm me and make sure they know i am inferior to them i know this is an anxiety response and in reality a lot of the signs i feel people give me don t in fact make sense i combat this by wearing ear defenders in public not only does this calm me down as i am sensitive to loud noises but i do think it is a signal to people that i am sensitive therefore they will treat me better i also tend to be very passive and submissive when i walk i yield to others consistently even if they weren t going to walk my way i avoid eye contact consistently with others walking past and watch my feet i feel like these motions give people the opportunity to further push their authority on me i often feel like a punching bag to others because i don t speak up i see this as a coping skill because it feels more comfortable to me rather than showing signs of confidence eye contact good posture fierce walk i was wondering if anyone had anything else that has helped them the stuff i ve learned combatting the thoughts and everything has helped but i still get incredibly uncomfortable in public it has made me unable to relax in public and exhausted thanks,social_anxiety
1pfbkq3,shh the quiet revolution the rise of the introvert a guide for channeling neurosis also known as ocd adhd add depression and anxiety into creative or genius talent our everlasting will to live and it s seeking of survival presents us with a concept most people deviate from because it does not apply to their personality type and this concept is perfectionism the drive of continuous improvement perfectionism is what the consciousness seeks to truly liberate itself and give in to the unconscious ever wonder why you toss and turn at night unable to sleep thinking of ways to improve your life well we can blame the drive to perfection for that here s how to channel that drive to talent nietzsche kauffman kant and freud all speak about sublimation an example of that would be sublimed sexuality a sexual impulse that can be channeled into a creative spiritual activity instead of being full filled directly the same can be said for intrusive thoughts but how do we do that this can be accomplished by allowing the neurosis to temporarily take over like that it s not being repressed but instead sublimed and channeled for your benefit let s use the example of someone wanting to t0rture their foe that can be sublimated into the desire to defeat one s rival in a contest or creative battle therefore sublimating the violent nature of the thought and instead translating it to rational and creative thinking now let s bring it back to more realistic scenario say it s 11pm you re laying in bed and the thought i m not good enough comes forward instead of pushing that thought away give into it temporarily and see what the root cause is you will not be able to figure out the root cause of the thought unless you give in to it close your eyes and feed it think who says i m not good enough why do i want to be good enough and let the neurosis do the rest eventually the thought will pass and you will return to a normal functioning state however this time when the neurosis returns with that same thought you can now tackle it with rationality and creativity instead of fear slowly un reveling the root cause and eventually getting rid of the thought all together within time the neurosis will be replaced by rational and creative thinking that can be channeled and harnessed for future life guidance have fun,social_anxiety
1pfb9yw,went to work xmas party here is what helped i d been dreading it for weeks it was hell but i managed to go through it me surrounded by 12 extroverts in a packed venue nowhere to hide what helped was the following: 1 lemon balm supplements i took 3 capsules previous night and then the night of party took a capsule at 4pm and then at 7pm the supplement has 2400mg lemon balm per capsule it really helped with the physical symptoms allowed me to simply ignore the negative thoughts and awkward moments it was mvp for me and i ll be using it for the future this must be what it is like to use medication or not have social anxiety i wasn t freaking out and not frowning which i normally do when anxious 2 this was an extreme method but it did help me alleviate the anxiety a little bit and that was what if this was my last day alive it could be the lemon balm but this helped me not overthink before the event 3 don t expect a result if you think in terms of i want this conversation or activity to go well you put pressure on yourself which is not needed especially if your battling anxiety so i just engaged in activity regardless of the result if i wanted to be quiet i remained quiet rather than forcing myself to talk awkward moments i ignored it s part of the social anxiety if you check my post history i always dread the work events this was hell but i got through it now i m on wind down and will try to avoid ruminating on the event hope this helps anyone who needs it,social_anxiety
1pf9xxb,volunteering was the unexpected cure for my lifelong social anxiety i want to share something that genuinely changed my life and i hope it might help someone else here who s struggling like i was for as long as i can remember social anxiety has controlled my life i was bullied pretty badly growing up and it left deep scars that followed me into adulthood over the years i developed this core belief that people were generally cold judgmental and unaccepting every social interaction felt like walking through a minefield i was constantly bracing myself for rejection or mockery it was exhausting about 15 years ago i decided to join a volunteer group in my area honestly i almost backed out a dozen times before that first meeting but something in me was desperate enough to try anything the difference was immediate and shocking people were nice genuinely nice and i started to realize why these were people who cared enough about something to give their time for free there was a sincerity there that i d rarely encountered before they weren t there because they had to be or because they were getting paid they wanted to be there and that changed everything about how they interacted here s what really got me: because volunteer groups are always looking for people to join they actually wanted me there for the first time in my life i felt welcomed with open arms i felt respected not tolerated not grudgingly accepted actually respected and valued i can t overstate how powerful that feeling was for someone who d spent years believing they were fundamentally unlikeable the real growth came when we d go out on activities that involved talking to strangers i won t lie some people would brush me off or outright reject what we were saying the old me would have spiraled from that convinced it was personal that i was the problem but here s the thing: i had people with me when someone rejected me my teammates would reassure me it was okay that it happens to everyone that it wasn t about me personally they d console me encourage me and we d move on to the next person together those experiences taught me more about human nature than years of therapy ever could i learned that rejection is often situational not personal i learned that most people are dealing with their own stuff and aren t examining me the way i feared i learned that i could handle discomfort and come out okay on the other side today my social anxiety has diminished so much that sometimes i can t believe it s the same person i can strike up conversations with strangers i can attend social events without that crushing dread and here s what really gets me multiple people have told me that i m a warm person that they genuinely enjoy my company me the person who spent decades convinced they were socially broken i m not saying this to brag i m saying it because if you d told me a 15 years ago this was possible i would never have believed you and if i can get here maybe you can too a few important notes: please don t ask me which specific group i joined i m not here to promote any particular organization the point isn t the specific cause it s that volunteer groups in general tend to create this environment because they need people because everyone there chose to be there because there s a shared purpose it creates a uniquely accepting atmosphere that said: please be careful and look into things before joining unfortunately some groups that present themselves as volunteer organizations can have cult like qualities trust your instincts if something feels off if there s excessive attention at first if they discourage you from maintaining outside relationships get out a healthy volunteer group should enhance your life not consume it or isolate you but if you find a legitimate cause you care about environmental animal welfare community service human rights whatever speaks to you i really encourage you to give it a shot you don t have to commit to anything huge at first just show up once see how it feels for me it was the beginning of getting my life back i hope sharing this helps someone else take that first terrifying step,social_anxiety

1pf3uqi,i really wonder what s wrong with me so i have social anxiety as you might well expect from the sub i m posting this in among many other negative side effects this also means that getting into a relationship is hard i ve been in relationships before four in fact one girlfriend i met at a party when i was 17 before my social anxiety was as bad my second girlfriend i just happened to coincidentally meet on social media and my third 6 years and fourth 1 year girlfriends i met on dating apps which brings me to what i want to talk about if talking about things like dating apps matches etc makes you uncomfortable stop here anyway i won t specify exactly how long but i ve been on several dating apps for quite a long time now i haven t been using them continuously i ve kind of had periods where i use them intensively and then long periods of time where i don t or barely use them at all but point is it has been a long time and in that time i don t know exactly what number of matches i ve gotten but i m relatively sure that it is at least more than 100 and of these 100 people i have been ghosted every single time every single time sometimes it s after one message which is particularly odd sometimes it s after a day of talking sometimes two or three in rare instances maybe a week but eventually it always happens we re talking and poof they stop responding now look sometimes people don t click that s fine i get that and yeah some conversations i felt were probably not moving in a fantastic direction so i totally get not continuing to talk then but there are other times where the conversation seems to be going well we seem to have a lot in common we re both making jokes everything seems like it s going pretty well and still poof they re suddenly gone never to come back now there have been some instances where i have been asked out but of course because of my social anxiety going out with someone after talking for like an hour is just not something i can do i need more time than that i need to feel like i know someone at least a little bit then i can maybe face the insane anxiety inducing awfulness that is a first date and what do those people do who asked me out and i said basically that i was interested but needed a bit more time they said it was totally fine and they understood and then they ghosted me and after being single for quite a long time now longest i have been in over a decade and after being ghosted literally over a hundred times i can t help but feel like utter trash like obviously in those cases where i was asked out and declined my social anxiety stood in the way and obviously sometimes you just don t click but what about those dozens of other people why did they ghost me like what is so wrong with me that s what i just find myself asking myself what is so wrong with me i just feel so worthless and unloveable and the thing is aside from just wanting to feel loved i like being in a relationship i m a relationship person i love cuddling and sending sweet messages to each other in the morning and walking hand in hand down the street and giving each other surprises and cooking together and so many other things i just love being able to look a woman in the eyes and tell her i love her and hear her say it back i just love that stuff i have a high desire for closeness and intimacy but at the same time after having been single for such a long time and ghosted so often i feel hopeless with my social anxiety i don t see myself finding someone irl so dating apps or a chance social media meeting very low odds are basically the only options i have and last time i found girlfriends that way but now i just can t seem to anymore and i fear deeply that i m going to spend my alone and it just literally makes me wonder what the point is and makes me want to die so yeah tldr i can t find anyone i keep getting ghosted and i just deeply fear never finding my soulmate and i miss having a girlfriend and i feel so utterly and completely worthless and undesireable,social_anxiety

1pez07b,i need help i m physically unable to go to college clubs or join a group i have been such a weirdo since i was a kid that in elementary school everyone rejected me even before i said anything to them i got kicked out of every group i tried to join and that has led to me being afraid of trying to talk to anyone the simple act of trying to ask something to someone makes me feel extremely embarrassed of being myself it sounds weird but that s how i feel it everyone i see around me has such an ease to talk to everyone and laugh at everything i m from a country known for its sociable values i tried to join a college club because i like photography and art although i m a beginner and i wanted to join to a group of people once and for all and i can feel it i can see the same uncomfortable gaze from every person i try to approach and i know it s due to the way i look and my facial expressions how am i supposed to explain to them that i m too scared of entering the club even my mother makes fun of me for being scared of people it literally feels impossible to open the door and enter that club i can t stand their confused looks and how uncomfortable everything feels when i try to say anything it s getting exhausting please i don t want to sound harsh or ungrateful but please don t tell me to go to therapy i ve already tried it twice and it was horrible the therapist was very inconsiderate but the worst thing is that she began to talk about bert hellinger a controversial spiritualist that defended incest and h tler and his pseudo therapies like he was a respected psychologist i don t trust psychology anymore not because i think it doesn t work but because i don t want to find something worse or lose even more time like i did with this one,social_anxiety
1peyuki,extrover to introvert w social anxiety hello i am a 24 year old woman and i m in a crisis ever since i was little i was a quiet child i didn t draw much attention to myself i always had that one solid friendship with someone but i knew how to interact and make friends growing up i was bullied nothing too extreme but i was always that particular one with niche interests then in high school i didn t really know how to make new friends or interact until i became friends with a girl in particular very outgoing and genuine and i started copying her behavior from that moment on people started talking to me more boys would approach me and everything was going great then we went separate ways for university and things continued to go well for a while until i overdid it with smoking weed and going to parties mostly just to feel accepted that is where the crisis began i fell into depression i became unrecognizable i smoked all day dpdr emerged and i started changing how i saw people i was focused entirely on myself and i stopped talking to everyone after that came another phase i wasn t doing drugs anymore i removed all my piercings i started studying and committing myself again but i had lost all the connections i once had except for one group of friends a few months later i went abroad for erasmus and i was completely reborn i became everything i wanted to be i looked good i took care of myself though with ups and downs and thanks to a girl i lived with who had a personality similar to the one i knew in high school but also maybe thanks to the mood i had i made a lot of friends a year has passed and i am still here living with my boyfriend in the same student residence where we met and now i have realized that i don t know how to talk to people anymore i spent most of my life seeing people who struggled to interact as weird and now i have ended up being like them i understand them now and i would actually love to meet people like me when i talk i feel strange i come out with weird things i think i exaggerate my facial expressions because the person i am talking to suddenly opens their eyes wide i am trying to study how to approach people and the advice i get is to show interest in the other person but i can t the words don t come out or if they do they come out confused i feel alone and the anxiety is overwhelming is there anyone who feels the same way or who has gone through something similar if so what advice can you give me sorry for the english but i ve written it without being lucid,social_anxiety

1pekiwo,is it normal to like always overanalyze everything i have this friend of mine or at least i consider her a friend of mine that s always called me her best friend i don t know when we established that since personally i ve had other friends seem to care more but then again they always leave so either way i m a teen in hs but i m well learned at a little bit competitive so i ve always been on top rn i have the highest gpa in our grade but this friend s always making weird jokes like joking about how i got lucky or how it s just because she gets headaches sometimes she often feels the need to over correct me and speak over me at all times even if she ends up being wrong and even then it s just another excuse of what she actually meant and no apology at one point we were talking about college essays and my teacher said not to trauma dump because the college admission officers are probably used to reading about trauma i because the class was dead felt the need to make a joke at my expense i said something along the lines of i don t know about that my trauma s pretty special i might earn a full ride off of that alone i know that people around the globe go through a lot so i expected like ppl to laugh at the ridiculous joke which some people did but the friend looked straight into my eyes and was like be so serious you know your trauma s not that special and i had to sit there for a moment because we ve kinda been friends for years and i ve told her a lot about my life it was never really a friendship in the traditional sense now that i think about it just her sticking to me because i was one of her first friends and her only friend for a little while and when i was speaking she was always off handedly listening before redirecting the conversation to her but it still hurt it sounded like she was joking though and i do have a tendency to overthink this it s not the first time she s been kind of shady towards me but i don t know everyone around me is convinced she s the best friend ever to me am i thinking too much or does she not like me i m so confused,social_anxiety

1pebfrt,life job search and its stumbling blocks since i was young i ve felt like i don t really fit into the world growing up with an alcoholic and sometimes aggressive father severely damaged my self esteem i often think about my childhood and now realize that no one ever told me when i did something well i struggle with imposter syndrome and usually feel that i can t do anything i completed an apprenticeship learned a trade about 10 years ago then decided i wasn t good enough for the job and went to university i actually thought i would go into marketing but my professor advised me to pursue a technical field but after 5 years in two different companies i am deeply unhappy with what i worked as my partner and i have also just gone through a big move and i have to reapply for jobs in completly different country i m in my mid 30s and feel like i haven t arrived in life havent grown up and be career driven and also kind of worthless i haven t started a family or had ever a successful career plan in my mind i don t know what career path to take all the job ads overwhelm me i find many different things interesting in principle but i usually don t have any qualifications for them h professions community or go back and try marketing again i feel old and super lost as if i can t do anything but going back into my old job path is also not an option because it gave me sleepless nights night sweat the feeling of being sick nightmares crying attacks after 6pm has anyone else ever gone through something like this i think my self esteem is to blame for the fact that i don t believe in myself but the truth is i have no experience in any of these professions and my imposter syndrome isn t helping the idea of a new job excites but also scares me trying to get in touch with new colleagues and trying not to behave awkwardly i always feel a little jealous when i hear about people who trained studied for a certain profession but are now doing something completely different and are really happy with it do you have any advice just go ahead and apply but if i get a job it will become apparent that i have no experience in the field and somehow i ve never had a good training period before i feel like employers only want experts with 5 years of experience that s pretty much what all job ads say,social_anxiety

1pe7vq7,how to handle group projects with social anxiety i have social anxiety and depression i ve had anxiety since i was a kid and i m an adult now studying in university my studies have been fine except when our classes include group work they re often worth more than half of the grade so very big projects it s almost always a group of four or sometimes three it doesn t really matter since i won t be talking and voicing my ideas either way so as i mentioned during our group meetings i m mostly silent sometimes agreeing and speaking only when someone directly asks my opinion and even then i feel like thousands of people are watching me and if i say one wrong word i m getting thrown off a cliff as a punishment i find it very hard to get the courage to speak when the other group members are more talkative and say the thing i had in mind before me in these situations my mind is basically in freeze mode and my anxiety is through the roof so thoughts are very hard to form and it feels very discouraging to hear the only idea i had in mind be said by someone else i basically lost my chance to participate and now the subject has already changed i might tell about my ideas later in our group chat by text which is way more comfortable for me the times i have tried to speak up i end up getting silence back i don t understand why yes my sentences are rather short but i ve voiced my concern and now suddenly nobody has anything to say it s very awkward as if the situation wasn t uncomfortable enough i don t want to talk much since i often stutter and forget basic words which makes me look stupid it makes me feel depressed and i just try to suffer through the meeting while guilt and other bad feelings creep up i don t know how can i improve this has anyone felt this way and somehow overcame it since i ve been in multiple group meetings weekly now and i still feel the same maybe worse it s not boosting my confidence as often happens when you keep doing something and realize it wasn t so bad i desperately want to be able to contribute my part and i don t want my group members to think i m slacking off on purpose thank you,social_anxiety
1pe7l0b,should you ask your therapist about their lives and how its going so yeah i ve had 2 different therapists and a psychiatrist i m polite and nice of course but i never really ask them about their lives i m always interested when they share something about themselves but i m never asking it feels a bit awkward and of course now that i m thinking of it i feel like a bad person that i never ask,social_anxiety
1pe7d5e,my company is hosting a happy hour party thats mandatory for half of us some of us work late til 5:30 and the rest are off at 4:30 the party starts at 4:30 but if people are off it s optional for us late nighters we re expected to go because we ll still be on the clock i have maybe 2 or 3 friends here that i can be comfortable around but they re all leaving at 4:30 it s also on the other side of campus it s a large company with a campus of many buildings and i don t drive so i ll have to walk in the rain to get there and then have triple the walk to get home again in the rain this is wildly uncomfortable and i hate everything about it i already told my manager how i feel and they just said too bad it s mandatory so now i have to show up but they certainly can t expect me to be in a good mood there s gonna be cookie decorating and beer but i don t drink beer and i don t eat cookies and watch them get mad at me for not participating god i fucking hate this there are 0 people there i m comfortable being around what the hell do i do,social_anxiety
1pe67gd,i hate when neighbors try to chat in the hallway i panic and say the most awkward things every time i see neighbors in the hallway my heart starts racing today one of them started asking how my day was and i felt my brain completely shut down i ended up stuttering and saying something awkward like a nervous robot i could feel my face getting hot and when i finally reached my door i had to sit down and take a few deep breaths i know it s just a few seconds of conversation but my mind keeps replaying it endlessly,social_anxiety
1pe62ze,too anxious to even call therapists how do you get past this catch 22 graduated last may with a degree in marketing but i still haven t found a real job because i keep bombing interviews or canceling them last minute my social anxiety has gotten so bad that even phone calls make me panic and in person interactions are worse i know i need therapy but the irony is that calling therapists and doing intake appointments triggers the exact anxiety i need help with i ve had the insurance provider list open on my laptop for three weeks i ve picked up my phone to call probably 20 times and then chickened out when i finally forced myself to leave a voicemail last week i was shaking so bad i could barely talk and i m sure i sounded completely unstable they never called back which just confirmed my fear that i m too much of a mess for anyone to help my parents are getting frustrated with me because from their perspective i m just not trying hard enough they don t get that the process of finding help is the thing i need help with they keep saying just make the call just go to the appointment like it s that simple if it was that simple i would ve done it already i looked into online options because at least typing is easier than talking but betterhelp and those apps don t take insurance and i can t afford 300 a month when i m not even employed i need to use my dad s insurance but that means finding an actual therapist and making actual phone calls and doing actual intake appointments and the whole thing feels impossible has anyone else dealt with this how did you get past the initial hurdle of actually accessing help when the act of accessing help is the thing you re anxious about i feel stuck in this loop and i don t know how to get out of it,social_anxiety

1pe541t,my anxiety during the meeting was unreal today my manager scheduled a meeting for the entire team to discuss our numbers and kpis i m known for consistently achieving my targets often ranking as the top performer even ahead of some senior team members during the meeting my manager unexpectedly asked me to share with the team how i ve managed to excel and become number one he wanted me to take the lead and give a talk but my anxiety skyrocketed i ended up speaking without much sense and kept repeating myself idk feel nothing but embarrassed and a bit foolish i just wish i were a better presenter what a sad day,social_anxiety
1pe2x6q,sertraline experience hello everyone yesterday tuesday i completed my sixth week taking 50 mg of sertraline although i previously took 25 mg for 10 days so my body could adjust the first week was probably the worst in terms of anxiety although i m doing better now but this week has been awful a lot of anxiety negative thoughts and maybe it has to do with the fact that i m in exam season but honestly it s been terrible and i thought i was going to have a really good week because on monday i felt fine sociable and all that but these past few days have been awful i wanted to know if something similar has happened to anyone else p s : did you also feel like when your social anxiety decreased you were your true self,social_anxiety
1pe0fmk,im practicing small talk with ai before social events and it s actually reducing my panic attacks i have social anxiety and small talk is literally my worst nightmare i freeze up can t think of anything to say generally give stupid answers then spend hours afterwards replaying every awkward silence and convincing myself everyone thinks i m weird my therapist suggested exposure therapy but the thought of forcing myself into social situations before i m ready just makes my anxiety worse so i started practicing conversations with an ai first as a middle step ik it sounds ridiculous but its actually helping me build confidence without the pressure of real people judging me irl i can practice asking follow up questions work on thinking less about finding perfect responses experiment with being vulnerable without worrying i said something wrong it s low stakes enough that i don t spiral into panic but still feels like actual conversation practice ive been doing this for about a month and went to a work social last week still nervous but didn t have a panic attack beforehand for the first time ever baby steps but any progress with social anxiety feels massive when you ve been struggling for years anyone else found ways to practice that don t involve throwing yourself into the deep end before you re ready,social_anxiety
1pdwq14,social life i ve got a pretty simple question but it seems like a lot of adults are dealing with it silently: do you become alone surrounded as you get into your twenties or thirties i see more and more people moving changing jobs getting into routines and one thing always comes up: friend circles shrink meeting new people becomes rare and even when you go out or run into people the conversations often stay super shallow i feel like a lot of us feel this way: being in a bar or at a party surrounded by people but not really connected wanting to share a simple moment without really having anyone to do it with or just thinking: is it just me or has it become really hard to make new friends after a certain age so i d be super curious to hear your thoughts: is this something you re experiencing too has it become harder to connect with people than before in your opinion how do you do it or how would you like to do it to meet new people these days i d really like to read your experiences it helps me understand what people are really going through behind this topic that we rarely talk about even though it affects way more people than we think,social_anxiety

1pdvcu5,you re not nervous you re excited one of my favorite perspective changers is knowing that being nervous is effectively the same as being excited i appreciate this isn t for everyone but i can t tell you how much it s helped my social anxiety let me expalin you know that feeling heart racing tight chest shallow breath sweaty palms you label it: nerves your brain quietly adds: discomfort and danger here s what s wild: on a purely biological level that state is almost identical to excitement in both cases your sympathetic nervous system is switched on your built in get ready mode your adrenal glands release adrenaline and noradrenaline your heart pumps harder blood flow shifts to your muscles your breathing speeds up to pull in more oxygen the gut slows down which is why you feel those butterflies or sinking feeling chemically it s the same family of signals your body uses when something matters and you need to be more alert more focused more ready to act so what makes one feel awful and the other feel electric the brain s interpretation layer when you re anxious regions like the amygdala flag the situation as threat your prefrontal cortex then spins up worst case scenarios and your attention locks onto what could go wrong when you re excited much of the same arousal is there but your brain s reward circuits are more involved the story becomes: there s potential here something good might happen same body different prediction you get that feeling of wanting something to come emotions are basically: body sensations brain prediction story you can t always control the first part a big moment will light up your system that s biology doing its job but you can influence the prediction and the story next time you feel that surge before something important don t fight the sensations or assume they mean you re not ready notice the racing heart the fizz the heat and tell yourself: this is my body mobilising these are the same signals as excitement my system is gearing up to help me perform you switch from fear and danger to excitement and engagement then point your mind at the opportunity the idea you want to land the person you want to be proud of the possibility on the other side you re not pretending you re relaxed you re doing something smarter: letting the biology of nervous become fuel for excited,panic_disorder
1pdtfth,awkward relations with people i don t know if anyone else will relate but as a socially awkward anxious person ive had many awkward experiences with people throughout my life i don t want to get specific because its embarrassing and even though its probably extremely unlikely i worry that one of the people i was awkward with might be on this reddit and realize who i am but whenever i have an awkward experience with someone in my head i feel like ive ruined any hope of having further relations with that person like ive messed up and i have to find a new person to be friends with i want to go outside and be social and just talk to people but im afraid that i might run into someone ive been awkward to in the past because there are literally so many and its not just in my head i have literally seen people who ive been awkward with in the past at my gym and where i work which are essentially the only places i go where i could run into someone luckily ive never had to interact with them i just saw them but what if i am in a situation where i am forced to talk to one of these people i imagine these scenarios in my head like if im trying to make friends and one of my new friends introduces me to someone who ive been awkward to in the past that would just be a nightmare i dont even know what i would say these thoughts just fill me up with fear and prevent me from going outside and being social and its so annoying because i could just talk to these people and pretend like those awkward encounters never happened or i could apologize but i feel like you shouldn t have to apologize just for being awkward except for the ones where i literally just ignore people like this one time someone i knew from school waved at me and i just pretended like i didn t see them i obviously did see them but i literally have no social skills so i had to just ignore them this was very awkward and while they where still around i further pretended like i had no clue who they were i played dumb even though i am a very aware person and i feel like they 100 knew that i recognized them which just made the whole experience just so awkward its weird because i am very aware as a person im very curious and always looking around for something interesting that s my nature i would say but because of my social anxiety im forced to put my head and not look around too much in social situations because what if i see someone i know then i will be forced to interact with them and that ll be awkward so i just suppress my natural curiosity to avoid painful social interactions its so stupid that i have to do this but i do i wish i just felt comfortable enough to have conversation with anyone its not even like i only struggle conversing with people who ived been awkward to in the past its just anyone i know in general but especially people who i know and have awkward relations with its just so silly to be afraid of social encounters there are literally no real consequences except the feeling of embarrassment but i can take that i shouldn t be scared of it yet i am any who that s my spiel done,social_anxiety

1pdmu0s,have you ever gave a dumb response and felt embarrassed i have plenty of examples about my dumb responses to things i m really anxious if someone initiates a conversation and i tend to be really awkward so much so that sometimes i can be physically stiff and barely move or i just shake my head when saying yes or acknowledging how bad something is it depends on how comfortable i am about the person situation topic etc if im anxious i tend to just really blurt out or say something so weirdly worded like today on the bus i work warehousing a and was coming back on the bus with 3 talking coworkers me and this other guy had to get off to catch another bus home before we left one guy asked me who does my hair and i just replied with the name of the lady who did maintenance on my hair and he said you acting like i know who that is and i tried to remember the shop name but i didn t and i looked up the ceiling probably like how a character in a comic or cartoon does when thinking and then i tried to make it less awkward by saying the street the lady s shop in on and that it s one the way to the job since the bus to my job passes hers shop i fist bumped the 2 people that stayed awkwardly and just got off the bus mind you i fist bumped them already when we were about to get off i just went home repeating just that interaction in my head another example is my mom knows this one lady who drives the bus and to be honest i really don t know her and i don t recognize her whenever i take the bus one time she was the driver to the train station and i didn t notice so when i had my headphones on waiting for the train she ran from the bus to greet me and ask me what was i up to and i said my girlfriends town i don t know that sounded to awkward to me at least i was kicking myself for that one too i remember when my girlfriend s sister came into her house with her boyfriend and my gf was at college my sister asked me where my girlfriend was and i felt awkward since i was laying on the couch watching a movie and i said she s at the school just another one for the books what was the most embarrassing response you ve given someone,social_anxiety
1pdmkad,erythrophobia fear of blushing medications i ve been dealing with blushing since i was around 13 in social situations when i m stressed and in a warm room i feel my face heat up and i go bright red i ve recently been trying out medications and haven t had any success yet with my symptoms yet i tried propronoral 30mg and clonidine 1mg which i ve heard are very helpful for other people but i didn t experience any relief i also tried hydroxyzine and although it did help to relax me it didn t help with my blushing i just started taking gabapentin and i m hoping this works i know it can take a few weeks to build up your system has anyone tried any other medications that helped them with their physical anxiety symptoms i know the next step would probably an ssri or snri which i was on lexapro for 2 years for general anxiety and they also did not help my physical symptoms so i m hesitant to get back on one,social_anxiety

1pdkzt8,i can t be the only one who s like this does anyone else have anxious thoughts about people pleasing when you re alone like i ll make up scenarios in my head about situations where people disprove of something about me and ways to fix it and prevent them from ever thinking that to an extent everyone has conversations in their head but this feels like frantic rumination about every little thing i try to do it s actually driving me nuts and i m trying to catch myself whenever it happens but i m so tired i ll give you an example so this makes more sense lol in this example let s say i m decorating for christmas something that is fun for me i ll think things like look at all this plastic i wonder what this person would think about my decorations i m being too rough with my garland it s going to scratch the walls what if this person sees how i m doing this right now they wouldn t like it i should do this the best possible way i don t have enough decorations but i actually have too many i should buy more no i should thrift more no i should wait to accumulate them slowly over the years i m using batteries which will lead to more trash i m being too consumerism i should mop the floor but what if my cleaning solution leaves a residue and hurts my dog what s the most optimal schedule of floor mopping etc etc etc i always circle to specific people in my life and what they would think of my choices as if i m being watched and scrutinized constantly it s like i m searching for all the potential mistakes i could make and ways to avoid them or explain to people why i chose to do things a certain way i don t know why i m so terrified of doing something wrong and people seeing it makes me feel like i m so self absorbed when really i don t want attention i just want to peacefully exist among people and chill out and discuss hobbies and just have a good time i want to speak my mind without automatically filtering myself based on how i want the other person to think of me it feels so fake to be like this everyone says i m so nice but it s exhausting and it s a selfish form of nice in a way it s entirely possible that i just need to increase my medication and book a session with my therapist which i plan to do i was just wondering if anyone with social anxiety also experiences this,social_anxiety
1pdkmnr,the problem with exposure therapy the problem is that even when i take intuitive or expose myself my mind is so paralyzed in panic mode and in distress such that the interaction results in being incredibly cringe and awkward that interaction essentially creates a net increase of anxiety due to being so horrible trying to interact basically just pours fuel on the fire so if not interacting increases my anxiety and interacting increases it even more what am i even supposed to do no way out,social_anxiety

1pdjmlz,how do you build close friendships i know this is an insane question to ask but seriously i don t know how people do it and i would love if someone could lay it out more me i feel like my friendships start off strong where we will come up with things to do together places to go but they lack the closeness of just being able to come to each others house to hang out and for that to be good enough it always feels like it has to be out and about spending money which isn t super sustainable for me rn especially if i do it with multiple friends it seems that if we hang out at one of our houses it s awkward and just us talking which i sense that my friends are sick of and i wish that we could just do things in the house together it makes it tough since i still live at home with my parents as do my other friends but in my situation my family isn t very welcoming so we would be secluded to just my space anyway overall with the friends i ve had i feel like we just talk the whole time instead of actually engage in fun genuine activity and the conversation can feel a bit forced too since we normally just talk about what we are going through etc which is fine but i used to be close with these friends and now i feel them drifting away and i feel like that is due to us having such intense conversations when we are 1 on 1 or conversations where we maybe don t catch up enough if we see each other with some others but it would also be nice to know how you keep up with your friends over text because i don t do that too too much either like maybe once or twice a month just not sure how to get out of the pattern of just hey how have you been doing i ve just been striving for a more authentic less forced relationship for so long and i feel like i m too awkward to be myself and have a normal friendship i ve been friends with these people for 2 3 years now and i thought it would eventually get better and we would get close enough where it wouldn t feel so scary and awkward every time we hang out now we just hang out briefly catch up on the surface and then don t text until next time every friendship that i ve had that was a bit more successful seemed to be because i was lucky enough to find friends who led the friendship more and seemed to have a lot more experience and made it comfortable right away but i don t know how to just be fully myself and get us talking about our interests or doing fun things together rather than just analyzing our problems i totally feel like this is a me problem not a them problem by the way so i d love to know how i can be more welcoming and warm i guess to invite deeper connections with others,social_anxiety

1pdhuws,i feel like a fool that i allowed anxiety to take away my happiness and confidence i feel so much regret even thought i m now in late 20s because honestly the mind gets you like it will remind you and make you feel like shit when you don t do the things you know you should be instead you keep suppressing your thoughts and feelings you keep living in comfort zone and don t take risks you don t even try and take actions you only keep continuing making fake promises to yourself that i m so this and that and no wonder why i m not confident right now not feeling masculine and internally strong or brave because i let anxiety or shyness or previous failures just get to me i m kinda tired of this because your seeing younger people advancing in life meanwhile your not even trying and seeing within yourself that do you have potentional,social_anxiety
1pdfz98,is it social anxiety or something else do i have some mental illness whenever i walk i can t face people and if i look around i feel like people are watching me only might be judging if someone is near walking and laughs loudly i get thoughts like are they laughing at me and also when i walk i really don t like getting even close to someone i will either walk too fast and move forward or literally will stop there for some seconds and will start walking i don t like if my purse or anything is touched or i touch mistakenly also since the road is crowded maybe it s normal i do everything to avoid people i try to stay far from them so there s no chance of touching it s like a war for me to go home from office i watch series on my mobile to avoid people i just look down and walk sometimes i feel people can clearly see how nervous and uncomfortable i m while walking if i see someone i get so much nervous i forget how to walk then in mind i have to say just keep moving legs even i can t cross roads i had one accident when i was 10 years old so now i really can t cross i haven t forget that and actually no one ever taught me also but i have learnt it it s not like idk how to cross the road but i just can t i get afraid and it s just too hard for me 23f edit : idk if any bad experiences from the past have made me like this or not but when i was younger at that time i really had bad experience like men randomly touching inappropriately in the market because it s crowded and that time i didn t had guts to fight to them and also some man have followed me so many times i literally use to cry because of that and yes i don t feel safe while walking everytime,social_anxiety

1pdflpt,how to start conversations with people if you have social anxiety bruh why am i so scared to talk to this girl she s an introvert has no friends and she kinda doesn t give a shit who talks to her but she keeps staring at me and looking at me since school started and i m scared she won t talk to me but what i have noticed is she seems to be trying to get close to me on walks and i do as well but both of us being introverted and shy is a bad mix like bro i go beside her last week on a walk on monday said how are you and it came out so bad she didn t hear me and just saw me looking at her i hate how i built up enough confidence just for that to happen we just stared at each other then i looked away then she did like bruh i think at this point it s time to just say fuck it and talk to her the worst that can happen is she doesn t care if she doesn t care or acts like she doesn t and continues staring at me i mma just ask why at that point like damn she is really pretty black hair a bit tanned but damn i don t know why she likes me probably because i barely talk to anyone and i m introverted by the way at the end of the school day i walked beside her because we were going the same way she started going behind me and i kept kinda looking at her then it was too late to talk to her since my friends were there waiting for their parents other signs she likes me: she s staring at me looked at me like 10 times in a day when i came into the art room she looked at me when i m talking to teachers she looks at me in the computer room she looks at me because i m kinda to her right across the room one time i was talking to the teacher and she was looking at me and i could see her looking at me so i started smiling and getting uncomfortable since she was looking at me i can t hold eye contact with teachers or other people for long and then her looking at me behind the teacher bro then i kinda kept looking then i got very anxious i get anxiety in public places and when i m not with a friend and this doesn t help since i think for a long time before talking to people or starting a conversation people normally come up to me because i m chill but damn when she looks at me my heart just starts racing another reason she might like me: she got a friend she was with to ask me to talk on the phone i was like why so i said hi then she giggled and was like hi then i was like they making fun of me that was last school year,social_anxiety

1pdetkf,dealing with social anxiety and looking for help i ve been struggling with social anxiety for a long time but i never talked about it because no one around me seemed to deal with the same things i thought i was just overreacting now that i m getting closer to turning 18 thinking about college getting a job and preparing for the future the anxiety has gotten worse and i m genuinely worried about how i ll manage i ve been physically abused throughout my childhood and even now it still happens sometimes though it s mostly verbal abuse i ve also been bullied for years i recently learned that past trauma can play a big role in developing social anxiety and it makes a lot of sense because i ve become extremely unsocial i do have friends but i only see them at school i don t hang out with anyone outside of that and i basically spent this whole summer at home without going anywhere i constantly feel like people are judging me being at school is uncomfortable especially during lunch if someone looks at me i immediately assume they re judging me and i lose my appetite there were times when my friends literally had to cover me while i ate or check if someone was looking just so i could feel a little safer but even that didn t really help public places are hard for me i hate being in public and i can t bring myself to use public transportation alone go to the mall alone or do basic everyday things that most people don t even think about it feels overwhelming and exhausting i had my first therapy session this monday and i ve already scheduled another one for next week it honestly felt good to finally talk about everything and let it out but therapy is expensive and i don t think i ll be able to afford it long term realistically i can maybe manage around 10 sessions i m also planning to see a psychotherapist once my spot opens up since the waiting line was about three months is there anything else that could help maybe medication or other alternatives i just want to get better but i m scared of going into adulthood feeling this way,social_anxiety

1pd98fp,use your big girl voice how about i punch you instead i hate how people are always condescending and treat you like you re some lesser type of being just for not talking or being a quieter person in general in terms of social anxiety i think i ve massively improved from where i was just a few years ago but i m still quiet and i don t think that part of me will ever change i still hate how people are patronizing and look at you like you re dumber or something just because i don t open my trap as much as others do many of us have rich inner worlds and are just hesitant anxious to share it with anyone else thank you very much it just makes me feel like an alien or something the quote in the title was said to me yesterday by a substitute teacher i m a senior in high school not totally related but i hate how as you get older your quietness or social anxiety is expected to just go away and if it doesn t then there s something wrong with you don t people see how rude that is you wouldn t be so happy if i said to you shh use your inside voice some other gems i ve been told: you re really quiet you know that yes i m aware what are you trying to get at you can teach your sister how to work the register and she can teach you how to talk said to me by my boss she talks yes and you need to do less of it it s just discouraging because almost every time i think to myself huh i think i ve been getting better with this someone comes along and says something like that it just pisses me off to be honest why is it seen as such a problem to be quiet sorry for the rant lol i wasn t expecting it to be this long just needed to get it out of my system i guess,social_anxiety
1pd8pwd,is this a common social anxiety experience or just me i don t really know why i do this but when people start to get familiar with me know me by name or anything like that my natural response is to pull away and start avoiding them as an example there is a local distillery i like and one day i walked in and the bartender welcomed me by saying hey insert my name here how s it going and my immediate thought was i want to leave and never come back does anyone have a similar knee jerk reaction like this or have any insight on this i don t really understand why my first reaction is to flee,social_anxiety

1pd1tvl,how do i stop ruminating after painfully awkward social interactions for context i ve had pretty bad social anxiety since about 13 years old it s gotten worse and better throughout periods of my life but never fully goes away right now i m 23 and i ve made a lot of progress in rebuilding my window of tolerance most days i mainly just struggle with overthinking worrying that i m a fraud not good enough annoying soaking up others personalities around me to make up for not having my own now that i have a few friends i have some days where i feel completely inept at socializing like i forgot how to be a human being my face heats up and i feel instantly embarrassed when someone talks to me it s worse with work friends because i have to see them nearly every day even on the days when i feel like a shell of a person the more i fumble in my interactions with them the more i ruminate on it it fuels my anxiety and makes me fumble even more i constantly have the urge to apologize for making things so uncomfortable or explain that i ve been feeling off i ll replay the interaction for days or weeks afterwards cursing myself for being so alien i just feel so inferior to them all like they ve figured out how to be a whole person and i m just trailing after them stumbling along it s so much worse when i get to the level of friendship when we greet hello and goodbye with a hug or a dap i constantly fuck up somehow and create a super obvious awkward situation it s like my hand eye coordination and spatial awareness completely evaporate when i m nervous i m pretty open about my mental health with friends even new ones so we ve talked about anxiety depression cptsd etc even so i just keep wondering if they re as uncomfortable as i am if it s contagious i feel so guilty and frustrated i just want to have normal interactions and feel comfortable enough around people to build close loving friendships i really value meaningful deep connections and it feels so impossible to obtain when i m like this i don t know what the solution is but i wonder if i could just stop ruminating on my awkwardness then maybe it would stop the vicious cycle before my anxiety deepens does anyone relate,social_anxiety
1pd1ftp,huge improvement after quitting nicotine hey all just wanted to share this with you as i ve come to a huge revelation and i can t quite believe what i m experiencing i ve had social anxiety since i was 10 11 and i m now 21 mostly stemming from self esteem issues at the root of it and also bad experiences at school hugely socially awkward get flustered and bright red when attention is on me in social situations internally feels like i m in a fight or flight response when trying to uphold a conversation with someone i m not fully comfortable with so basically everyone bar a few people but in the last few years since i ve grown into an adult i ve also gotten quite the knack for masking it to try and look atleast somewhat normal on the outside anyway i ve been a heavy nicotine user for around 4 years solid daily started off smoking then went to vaping then in the last month of my nicotine consumption i switched to zyns randomly on a whim i quit cold turkey 2 weeks ago and somehow managed to stick to it and my lord it s a completely new world to me i can still feel i have social anxiety but it feels genuinely 10x smaller and in the back of my mind quitting has genuinely transformed the state of my mental health my depression and lethargy have massively improved by the end of week 1 i was just walking around at my job absolutely buzzing with life just happy to be me i started looking after myself properly keeping my room tidy and keeping on top of laundry self hygiene better and i feel so much more confident my self esteem is through the roof not in a cheesy way but for the first time in a long time i ve held a positive image of myself in my mind for a sustained period that s the key to it for me i think the self esteem issues were a large root cause to my issues and for some reason quitting has helped that immensely so if you have social anxiety and were considering quitting nicotine please take this as your sign to quit i thought it would be wayyyyy harder than it is first few days it was all i could think about but after that it s pretty easy the main thing for me has just been identifying and calling out the random day to day cravings for what they are environmental factors from the past that trigger your mind into thinking it s nicotine time remind yourself of that and keep a negative image of nicotine in your mind when you think about smoking again etc and it s really manageable i know it s only been 2 weeks but this has genuinely changed my life just wanted to share and potentially inspire someone else to try it out,social_anxiety

1pcwoyr,how does medication feel when it s helping social anxiety feel like i have some form of social anxiety alongside my adhd depression and some very mild autism i don t get any physical anxiety symptoms when talking to people or anything but i just always feel slightly awkward when talking to others part of it is because i feel like 80 of the time i m just not too invested in what the other person is saying and it feels like i m faking my reactions and responses all the time bc i don t really care about the topic i wish i did care about it but idk something there is just off for me i think part of it is just i care too much what others think and wish i could turn it off like a light switch but it just doesn t work that way after most conversations i always think i should have done this i should have made a joke i should have been more playful and lighthearted etc frustratingly the only thing i feel like that has helped me socially is alcohol it just makes me feel more sure of myself not feel as self conscious i m more outgoing and extroverted less serious and more talkative i feel like i know what to say to keep a conversation going it helps me truly not caring much about what other people think about me and i actually am generally 100 interested in what other people are talking which rarely happens sober it makes all the things i wish i could do during conversations just happen automatically it all becomes natural and easy like it should be the problem is i obviously can t rely on this in everyday life or for every social situation bc that s an easy road towards addiction i have tried a variety of antidepressants stimulants and anxiety medications for my mental health issues such as prozac zoloft auvelity wellbutrin ketamine therapy tms adderall vyvanse ritalin concerta intuniv strattera buspar metadate focalin dexedrine and more but none of them have had any real affect at all on my social anxiety let alone the way alcohol does i m not sure if maybe my expectations are just off about how medications are supposed to act on social anxiety but i always assumed they would be like the effects of drinking alcohol but instead of taking 30min to kick in it ll be 6 8 weeks for it to fully kick in obviously you wouldn t get the drunk everything is super fun and life is so wonderful feeling but i thought they would have the social benefits listed above or atleast some moderate noticeable change to any of those aspects maybe medications just didn t work for me but for those who take medication for your social anxiety how does it affect your social anxiety and what does it feel like is it just treating the physical anxiety symptoms that arise when in a social situation panic attacks nausea etc or is it like alcohol where it loosens you up everything is natural and is noticeable when it s working,panic_disorder

1pcqh63,i think my social anxiety is turning to paranoia just wanna see if anyone can relate i guess and what i could do about it it s been gradually getting worse i ve been growing more and more secretive especially around strangers and my online boyfriend whereas before i was an open book as an example there s a christmas thingy going on in a discord server i m in and they ask a question each day for us to socialise and share together today was the first question and it asks what our best christmas memory is the way i started thinking things like why do they need to know that i shouldn t share that it s none of their business what can they do with this information i should keep it secret i don t know why i just feel like i shouldn t share things like that like it s some sort of precious thing that i need to keep to myself and i m also scared of what all the random people in that server can potentially do with that information even though i can t really think of anything it s weird because even when i already had bad social anxiety i never had a problem with sharing things like that i actually loved talking about myself online because it was the only way to socialise that i had i miss it,social_anxiety
1pcp6sz,presentation tips hi all this is kind of short notice but i d really appreciate some advice i ve been at college for a few years now but i have done my hardest to avoid doing presentations on my own due to my fear of speaking in front of people i m very quiet by default and have a pretty bad stutter when it comes to doing such thing but tomorrow i have a pitch presentation for my graphics class we had the options to do a video with a voiceover but i wanted to do my best to branch out and get out of my comfort zone for once especially because my pitch is something i m very interested in i m just super worried about fumbling and making a fool of myself in front of my class and also with a time limit tldr any tips for first time presenting alone as someone with terrible social anxiety anything helps many thanks : d,social_anxiety
1pcota3,why am i so rude how do i stop i m spiraling please tell me if what i did is as bad as i think it was went to target by myself with the intention of buying something which is a big deal for me being that i hate checking out and am also really anxious when out by myself lucky for me the self checkout was dead when i got there anyway i chose to go to one of the self checkouts closer to the guy who was overseeing them and on my way there we made eye contact and he greeted me and said how are you i said im good and asked how he was back and then he casually went on to tell me that he was there until 8:30 and stuff like that i m not sure what to do when people actually start talking about themselves or anything like that when you ask how they are or if they just start talking about it even if you didn t ask anything lol asking how are you is just a courtesy thing to me like if i didn t ask it back i d be rude asf i also just feel uncomfortable speaking with strangers especially with other strangers around i ended up saying oh really wow and continued paying for my thingsi realized how terribly rude it sounded a second after saying it and wanted to die it was mostly cuz i just didn t know what to say and i was stressed about being in publicwhat made it worse was that he was handicap and seemed rlly sweet like he was just trying to chat cuz he was bored there cuz it was deadwhen i left i did smile and say thank you and he said have a good day and i said thanks you too not that it makes up for my dryness this isn t the first time i m rude to someone who tries to small talk either i just feel really uncomfortable and insecure talking to strangers and i think i put up my guard rlly quick this has been the hardest thing for me more so than actually going into places the whole thing made me want to stop trying exposure therapy all together cuz i felt like an asshole,social_anxiety
1pcnoku,how do you guys get yourself to be included again hi everyone i m new to this community on reddit and i was looking for some advice to give some background i moved to a new school in 8th grade and started high school in a super small town where everyone already knew eachother i struggled a lot making friends that want to actually get to know me outside of school but i did make one really good friend group last year one of my friends that had a crush on me i politely said i wanted to stay friends and he said he was fine with that got a new girlfriend i didn t care and i didn t know her that well but i always tried to include her she would always decline group hangouts turns out he thought i was trash talking his girlfriend when i was venting to my friend that i was sad he started ignoring me he sent me a really mean spirited text and when i responded with an apology he left me on delivered cut to this year my senior year he s suddenly back in the friend group despite blaming multiple of us for trash talking his relationship suddenly that entire friend group has been going to parties and hanging out without me it s weird to me that they wouldnt just call me and ask since indont have any classes with them this group has a history of stopping inviting people that did something wrong instead of confronting them i ve been really lonely this year and basically have no close friends i don t have any classes with the people i used to hangout with the loneliness has gotten really bad and i ve just been feeling worthless and hopeless i m scared to ask them about it or tell them that i m feeling left out i don t want to annoy them should i just ask if they re avoiding me should i just give up and accept that it s senior year and everyone doesn t need more friends,social_anxiety
1pcnc3n,i feel like i just can t do this anymore social anxiety had ruined literally every aspect of my life not a single issue in my life can t be traced back to my social anxiety i have been missing classes in university which is a whole other issue on it s own i fell so behind on work and i just feel like the biggest idiot in the world oh this very simple class requires only a group presentation to pass oh well fuck me i can t even open my stupid mouth to another person gg i guess i heard this metaphor about a glass of water in a ted talk guy was talking that stress is like this glass of water if i hold it for 1 minute nothing much happens if i hold it for 10 minutes my hand will begin to tire but if i were to hold it for 8 hours my arm would go numb and i just resonate so much with that my entire life i have been carrying this rock on my back called social anxiety i don t have a single friend nobody to text nobody to hang out with i just feel like i m at my end i can t do this anymore worst part is i feel like nobody really knows what real social anxiety is they just think i m a little shy or stressed when meeting new people,social_anxiety
1pcn90p,do you hate it when people are clingy it was my second day at a new place i met this person who talked with me we had the same sessions with lunch in between i thought they would leave me alone and go off on their own wrong this person stuck to me like glue even through lunch i told them that they didn t have to hang out with me but they said it s fine and kept hanging out with me i didn t tell them to leave me alone because i thought they would leave me it was annoying i did go up to them i think after i went to check something but that s because i felt guilty if i felt like i ditched them i think i did then say they didn t have to hang out with me but they said it s fine and stuck to me i can t remember if they asked if they could stick with me but i might have said yes but only because i thought they would leave me after our next shared session they asked for my social media even though they only stuck with me for only like 4 hours edit : and before our final session i said again they didn t have to hang out with me i can t remember what they said but it was to the effect something like you don t want to hang out with me in a weird tone so i just let them stick with me it was only one day but still i never saw them two days after that it was a new big place and they were so clingy i got anxiety they were going to come looking for me i had no clue what to do if they did a relative told me if they say hi reply hi back and then leave them without a word anyway i left that place because it wasn t right for me the person was the the kind of person you never got at my old school so i wasn t used to that,social_anxiety
1pcn8r6,how do you talk about yourself when you don t have experiences to talk about i m pretty socially anxious and have no real friends so i spend most of my time home alone on my way to school i was talking to the only person i would call my friend even though we don t hang out or anything and with him i can talk to normally and everything but then he asked me what s going on with me and i just couldn t answer it cause nothing s going on while he talks about how he got drunk with his friends or went to see a uni he s interested in i was at home doing nothing i have a lot of hobbies to fill my alone time with but i don t know how to talk about those cause i don t want to bore them with it especially if they have no interest in that hobby for example i draw a lot but i don t even know how i m supposed to talk about it i realized that this is probably the reason why we don t hang out or the reason why i can t make friends with anyone cause i can t talk about myself or the things i like they can t even get to know me cause i don t tell them anything about me can someone give advice or at least relate to what i m feeling,social_anxiety
1pcih58,how to deal with intertia avoidance from social anxiety hi all i 22m have had pretty bad social anxiety for a while now i m currently getting a master s in social work ironic i know but my anxiety is making it really hard for me to do my internship because i m incredibly nervous when working with clients and i m always worried about crossing ethical boundaries to the point where i feel like i come off kind of cold and disconnected i feel like my social anxiety is sort of atypical though because usually i m actually really good at small talk and i can make friends but the thing is i only really talk to people when they talk to me the issues i have are in not being proactive socially for example i stay back when i see people needing help because i don t want to embarass myself or assume that i don t have the skills to help them which i know is incredibly selfish and something i need to work on i don t seek people out to make friends with them i kind of just wait until they come to me and i don t take risks because i assume i m going to fail i was in therapy for like 4 years and it didn t really make a dent honestly it kind of just got worse over time i ve really tried to live by the do it scared mantra but it s so much easier said than done i feel like i just live on autopilot and i m curious if anyone relates has any advice thanks in advance,social_anxiety

1pbqrk2,how to streamline thoughts with my functioning anxiety is inhibiting memory and coordination i m not sure i m using the right phrasing for this but i ll elaborate i ve had social anxiety since i was in 6th grade and whenever i get any amount of anxiety triggered over anything which is about 50 of the time my brain struggles to coherently function a wrench is thrown into tasks that are muscle memory even basic built in tasks like communicating become much harder to streamline : instead of inherently knowing what i want to say and verbalizing it in a streamlined fashion i struggle with hitting basic sentence beats and sometimes even remembering where in the conversation i m at and what im trying to explain this is just one example but it makes me hardly functional in a handful of things when i know im capable of performing those tasks i ve joked to my therapist that sometimes i wish i had a lobotomy so that the buffer between overthinking and actions is eliminated basically that meme of no thoughts head empty except i mean it literally if my ruminating overthinking compounding thoughts didn t exist i could just do basic tasks like every other person can i don t even know if other people with anxiety and social anxiety are this bad at functioning sometimes im so dysfunctional i genuinely think i have damage to my brain because there s no way someone consistently and constantly forgets how to verbalize properly right basically my question is: does anybody experience this and how do you stop the wrench from being thrown in are there any specific medications or combination of things that have worked for anybody else when it comes to how memory coordination and anxiety interact a little more context: i ve been on lexapro for a few years started buspirone at the beginning of the year and am juggling adhd meds which are a more recent thing lexapro has definitely improved the streamlining by a little bit but i m still having constant difficulties,social_anxiety

1pbndio,story time hated for being socially anxious i m coming to the realization of how easily socially anxious or shy people are labeled as rude dismissive or cold just because we re quiet loud people are seen as confident and the quietest people are seen as a problem because we don t preform how society wants us to i m wondering if anybody has experienced something like this i m an arotc ms3 and in my school s program at the end of the semester we do peer evaluations you rank everyone in the class from best to worst based on their overall performance attitude as a cadet and write comments about your top 3 and bottom 3 explaining why you ranked them there i m a very reserved quiet and socially anxious person it takes a lot for me to open up to people i ve managed to make some friends non the less because i try to be as helpful caring and empathetic as i can to everyone the people i ve personally talked to said they ranked me high in the peer evaluations i ve had people tell me very nice things such as they trust me and they look up to me as a cadet i assumed i would rank around in the middle because i m quiet and don t know a lot of people but the people who do know me really seem to like me i was correct i ranked 28 57 exactly in the middle i was happy about that until we moved onto the comments i had one bad comment my jaw dropped as i was read a paragraph of the most detailed and personal attack on my character and existence as a human they said when people talk to me i m dismissive rude hostile and that i create tension for no reason i was in such disbelief that i literally couldn t speak it took me a few minutes just to process what i had heard and i kept trying to think of any reason someone would write something so hateful about me i eventually came to the realization that a lot of people see shy and reserved people dismissive it doesn t help that my voice is also very monotone i wish i wasn t like this but i can t help it this is who i am my theory is that this was not written by somebody who truly knows me i just find it so interesting how differently people can perceive the same interactions there is not one person in the entire program that i have disliked felt annoyed by or ever thought negatively of knowing that there s somebody in my class who hates my guts makes me so sad i really want to figure out who it is just to prove to them that i m a nice person anyways that s my story i m curious if anybody else has had strange hatreds misconceptions about them just because they are quiet great end the the semester,social_anxiety

1pbnazu,do i actually have social anxiety or am i just introverted i ve always felt like every time i went outside everyone was looking at me everything i did was judged even if they probably never noticed me i don t even visit my friends the way to their home if you know what i mean anymore because i absolutely despise this feeling of being surrounded by strangers or anyone i m not friends with it s almost as if people or anything that has me going outside of my house is a chore i know asking on reddit isn t diagnosing but i feel like this behavior is more than me being introverted i also feel connected if that s how you call it to all of the symptoms signs my parents refuse to get me diagnosed because they think mental illness means i m going crazy and need to immediately get thrown into a psych ward sorry for bad grammar or if i sound edgy or anything like that english is not my first language,social_anxiety
1pbmad4,is this about rejection or something else this weekend i posted in a discord server that i was a little bummed and disillusioned because i didn t get a response i had been hoping for to something i made and that i was less sure about doing something else because of that i was hoping for comfort and encouragement from other members but i was nervous because it felt vulnerable so i stayed away from the server for a few hours to distract myself when i finally looked the first response to me made it sound like i was acting entitled by being sad i felt like i was being publicly shamed i made a defensive reply didn t read anything else people had said and muted the server i haven t been able to look at it since for all i know that was the only jerk but i needed to calm myself down and now it s been so long i feel it would be disruptive to respond to anyone else even to thank them for kind words because the way discord works would drag the convo to the forefront again but also maybe other people thought there was something wrong with me being a little bummed too it s a shame because while i didn t have friends on the server and it always seemed a little cliquey i thought of it as a place with kindred spirits and now i ve cut myself off from it i feel like this is typical behavior for me i just don t know if i should be looking for advice on dealing with shame rejection or just general social anxiety,social_anxiety
1pblilj,can a man ever change without losing who he is i have had this internal struggle for a long time there are a few characteristics of mine that i feel are quite different from others this gives me quite a few strengths and a few significant weaknesses too i am always afraid of changing myself my thought process is that if i change myself i would become someone else who is not my true self due to this i am always hesitant to change myself to give a bit of background about myself i am 25m i am a very introverted person i generally keep everything to myself but i am quite good at observing everything finding patterns and always curious to know about all the stuff this took me distance and made me who i am today but it came with a big disadvantage i always took time to trust new people it always takes time for me to connect to a person and trust them this made me very bad at small talk and forming new bonds whenever i tried to be more extroverted it always felt like i am faking it and not being my true self at this point i want to change but not by destroying my true self has anyone else struggled with these thoughts i need some genuine advice,social_anxiety

1pbjpln,my social anxiety at present so i thought i d give an update on my situation just see if anyone feels similar or can relate as at the moment even i m not sure how to proceed moving forwards or process things for context i was on citalopram for 6 weeks then came off it kind of cold turkey it s been about 2 3 since that so last night i ventured out to see my friend at the pub we had a good catch up i was mostly fine ish i enjoyed chatting felt fairly comfortable however he had to leave earlier than me as he was driving back to wales i stayed on my own to finish my drink that s where my anxiety shows reminds me i definitely have it so i tend to just feel a bit awkward wooden almost like a spare part so to speak i say to myself over over just relax chill out enjoy your own company but it is always a challenge i went to order another drink from the bar even doing that i felt off i eventually drove home found myself super tired even though i only woke up that day around 2pm it s all such a surreal feeling on one hand i m grateful that i m able to get out meet a friend etc but on the other hand i know i ve completely got an social anxiety problem it affects my whole being my personality confidence everything i m not able to just enjoy being present anymore always feel a bit awkward i don t know if other people even realise it but in my own head it s 100 an ongoing problem can other people relate,social_anxiety
1pbdoni,body shaking experiences hi i don t speak english so i m sorry for any spelling mistakes i m 24 years old and i ve suffered from social anxiety since childhood i receive a disability pension and i work at a reception desk so financially i m taken care of but i don t want this to be the end of everything i want to get treatment and move forward however more than the fear of human interaction itself i m terrified of something else a thousand times more: that i will start shaking my hands head legs my whole body it limits me so much it s hell for example when i go to the cinema i can t even buy popcorn because i shake so much when paying in general paying for things is my nightmare when i m in the kitchen and someone comes in who watches or judges what i m cooking or baking i start shaking too the same happens when i count money at work visiting the dentist is also a nightmare i can t even drink from the cup to rinse my mouth four days ago i started taking 50 mg of sertraline i d like to try therapy eventually but later because christmas and the dentist are expensive and at the moment i wouldn t be able to save anything if i started therapy too i just want to know if any of you have personal experience with reducing body tremors or even getting rid of them completely it s truly destroying my whole life the worst part of all this is that i actually have potential i m really capable and i want to work but the shaking has prevented me from doing many jobs my general practitioner refused to prescribe propranolol because of my low blood pressure : i also have to add that i shake even in front of my friends my own grandfather my brother even though they re family but for some reason my brain sees everyone as a predator thank you for reading and for any advice you might have,social_anxiety
1pbb5ga,i wish all businesses would have websites i really should go to the dentist again for a check up been two years now since i ve last been but the only way to make an appointment with my dentist is through a phonecall so i keep procrastinating on it because phonecalls are so stressful especially because i want to ask if they offer certain services too so that makes me even more insecure about it they don t have a website or an email address to contact that i can find though so a phonecall seems to be the only way i hate that i really wish that every company that did appointments had at least a small website or at least an email that you can use being forced to use the phone sucks,social_anxiety

1pb4ut6,having social anxiety as an artist as you probably know being an artist requires to interact with people at some extent and is probably the thing i struggle the most over time i ve been able to respond to people who like my work and leave nice commentaries kinda but when it comes to interacting with other artists i usually feel so weird around these people even if they re friends i know for some years i can t interact with them without being dry in my responses or ignoring them completely i have a group of friends which i m more confortable with but even then i tend to ignore them not because i want it s because i don t know how to react i enter to discord vc with them but i never use my mic and when i do it i m very dry and i get very tense then there s the people who want to collaborate with me doing a drawing together or something like that i want to do it but if i do it i end up feeling super weird and sounding like i don t give a shit about it ironically i can handle stuff like commissions decently the problem comes when the relationship becomes more personal the worst thing is that i know if i don t do this stuff i won t be able to be what i want to be,social_anxiety

1pb1mi1,i don t think i can get out of it i ve never really posted on reddit before but i struggle with severe social anxiety i am not diagnosed i have been too scared even to get any help i ve only come to terms with this recently all my life i thought i was simply shy i never knew i would fall this deeply i find social interaction challenging and i no longer enjoy it as much as i used to i saw old videos i used to film on my leappad ultra and it was like a completely different person it was so far removed from who i am now even speaking to family members has got me feeling anxious and i know it shouldn t but i feel like a disappointment i am 19 years old and i have never had a job i could never land an interview because i get nervous and stutter even on the phone i never had any friends in high school because i took online school during the first year due to covid and i never got accustomed to the new environment when i went back to in person school everyone had someone so i kept to myself this affected me throughout my entire life i am in my second year of college and still have no friends my life consists of doing schoolwork playing mobile video games and then sleeping i know i have it better than most people i can focus on school work without worrying about managing time with a job but i don t want to stay like this forever i want friends even if i ll never be seen as a best friend even if we re just class friends i want a job but i can t land an interview because of my social anxiety i close up even when i m prepared even when i spend an entire week preparing for one day i feel like i will never be ready every year i feel like i m changing like i m starting a new chapter as i ll finally get out of this whole i dug myself into but i fall right back into this pit and i wonder if i m stuck here forever,social_anxiety
1pb19a5,i walked away from my bf and his family because i felt excluded my boyfriend asked me to come with him to see a cousin of his at college their culture is very close and social and he asked me multiple times to come i told him i didn t want to but because he asked and i was trying to beat back against social anxiety i decided to go i was very extremely nervous and those negative thoughts of rejection tried taking over but i fought against them i made myself envision the best be ready to be open and show interest in her and the dynamic my bf told me that they would speak english so i didn t feel excluded and that made me feel better however those two spoke 90 95 of the time in their language although they re both fluent in english and i don t understand pretty much any of their language it s a very difficult language spoken by one country of a few million people not well known i still walked with them though and hoped for the best my bf tried to include me in the convo and when i answered his cousin just gave a little throwaway comment to appease the contribution it seemed like it wasn t really something relevant or that she had or cared to have a response to and proceeded to speak in their language with my bf again i was trying to walk in line with them but my bf and his cousin did the infamous 3rd wheeler treatment of walking in front of me while i ended up following them and trying to get back in the line when his cousin saw her english speaking friends though she immediately went to speaking english with them i looked at my bf and he was smiling and looked happy his cousin and her friends appeared happy and i just felt rejected again like i failed again so i asked him for his car key he was still smiling and focusing on the scene unfolding and said we were all going to the car i asked him two more times for the key and he gave it to me completely engaged with the social stuff i sat in the car the remainder of the time he texted asking me to please come with them and that his cousin s bf was coming with them was an english speaker and and they would speak english i respectfully declined told him i was talking with family and to enjoy himself and take his time i fought back tears in the car and wiped them when they came back about 30 minutes or more later he asked me why i was angry and i tried not to answer and just said i was glad he enjoyed the visit he kept pressing for an answer so i broke down and told him how it felt he was trying to be understanding but said that it was disrespectful to him and that they basically did the same thing with his cousin s bf he said his cousin was asking where i went i m concerned i may have overreacted or been selfish about the whole thing i just feel bad that i made a huge effort felt excluded and when he told me he was too shy to meet my family on this very same day i didn t pressure or ask him to i think i have an additional problem with unconsciously expecting people to be as kind and inclusive as i would make an effort to be with people so they never feel how i felt in that situation but i rarely get the same treatment by others was i wrong or my vision warped,social_anxiety
1pb0ie3,anxiety and friendship drama over a year ago i got invited to a friends wedding out of town the day i got the invite i responded immediately that i couldn t make it as my family members wedding was two weeks later that same month also out of town i knew about the family wedding almost a year in advance i apologized profusely and offered to through a bridal shower was told no fast forward a month later i notice friend being silent to my communication so i asked if everything okay she sent paragraphs back saying i blew her off and never show up for her explained i also seemed unexcited to be at her birthday as well in the past i had no clue i seemed that way cause i have social anxiety and she knows that i responded recognizing her feelings and explained i really did my best plus apology i couldn t do both weddings and my family comes first she ghosted me after this text and never responded fast forward a year now this person is still bashing my business in town unfollowed me on all social platforms and still follows my friends could i have done anything better in this situation tbh i haven t seen her but the anxiety of running into her has been stressful i hate it s still bothering me and doubt she even thinking of me,social_anxiety
1pazowz,genuinely wigging out beware long rant ahead i don t even know anymore man i am alive yes but not living ever since graduating high school i ve been sort of stuck i go through periods of going to therapy and feeling optimistic about my future then being completely shut in my house just barely coping by playing video games and listening to music i am in the latter period right now and it sucks because i feel like i ve soft locked myself into an unfulfilling and meaningless existence 24 7 i m stuck and i m scared and i don t know where to start even the tiniest of a baby step seems like freefalling off a cliff most times on better days i just tell myself that i m doing the best i can right now on bad days i can t help but feel like the biggest loser in the world who too scared of getting a job or going outside and is a leech on my family making excuses for myself to stay in my comfort safe zone and be lazy all day i m not trying harder i m not pushing myself enough i am on the ground and in the end i ll only have myself to blame if i die in this exact same spot i choose to turn a blind eye towards getting better so i can get a couple achievements in whatever game i m using to distract myself in the moment but it s so much easier to do i think this is more about my mental health in general than any specific problems regarding my social anxiety but i just have to write i haven t done any kind of journaling in the past three or four months and it s lead to a pile up of overwhelming thoughts in my head get out get out get them out urrghh,social_anxiety
1pazjrq,some of my best tips advice to help overcome social anxiety as someone whos dealt with it severely im not here to sell anything i just wanna help whoever i can first some backstory when i was maybe 11 13 i was so quiet and anxious id often struggle to talk above a whisper as in physically id have one best friend who i would whisper everything to i could barely even answer my name on the roll call and more times than i can count someone else had to point me out to the teacher or answer for me now at 18 i can go anywhere talk to anyone i talk to people i like people i think seem cool bartenders servers hosts of events people ive never met before i can politely ask for a messed up drink order to be fixed i can talk into a microphone in front of a bar full of people people semi regularly comment on how they envy that i can talk to anyone and not get nervous and here are some things that helped me: 1 think of some people who really shouldnt be talking but they do anyway maybe its a coworker whos just always being rude to people and to top it off they speak at 5x a normal volume and dont stop talking and make it everyone elses problem you have to listen to them so you know what you can make them and whoever else listen to you too because youll still be more decent than them and have much more useful things to say and even if other people dont agree its really your own opinion that matters to a degree 2 back yourself no one else can speak for you and you deserve support that only truly comes from yourself even if you have someone in your life who sometimes does it life is unpredictable and its so important you can advocate for yourself it will improve your life so much 3 nothing really matters that much any one person s experience is ultimately irrelevant not in a mean way in a comforting way of course its not good for you to be upset or something but at the end of the day if someones rude or rejects you or disagrees with you or finds something you say weird there are like 8 billion people on earth and it wont cause any major catastrophes or leave any real impact in time even if it hurts its not the end of the world 4 if you do accidentally embarrass yourself somehow and it spikes your social anxiety think of how much worse it couldve been to frame it if you accidentally knock over a drink like i did the other day fix it up and then think hey at least i didnt set the whole bar on fire it seems silly but it gives perspective to something that seems catastrophic and makes you realise even if its not ideal its also not completely terrible 5 learn to assume people will like you and dont bother with people who dont this one takes a while and builds over time as you see more people who like you but it gets to a point where if youve started chatting to 6 people at an event and they all get along well with you and then one person gives you a weird look youll be able to think wow whats their problem everyone likes me and then shrug it off and find people you get along with 6 think worst case scenario unless someones physically dangerous in some way really usually the most someone can do is be rude or unpleasant which sucks but then you just ignore them and try your best to carry on you need to remind yourself that even though not ideal you can survive an unpleasant interaction also youd probably be surprised by the amount of people who are decent its easy to think things will go badly and then if you just never try you ll keep believing things will often go badly when in actuality it ll probably often be fine hope these help someone even a bit and if anyone has any questions just let me know and i ll try answer them,social_anxiety
1paz4rg,i wish silence was more socially accepted i realized that i love being with people when i don t feel pressured to talk to them i don t even dislike small talk it s just often too much and i hate that i feel pressured to participate in it i feel like conversations irl go way too fast for me and they re so hard to navigate i don t really have an interest in most things people talk about i feel like most of my opinions aren t interesting enough to be worthy of sharing and when i do feel curious or interested about something usually i miss the chance to talk about it because other people monopolize the conversation and change subjects very quickly i don t blame them i understand that some like chatting and or get anxious about silence and it s up to me to interrupt but when there s no room for even a little bit of silence it makes it so exhausting to follow conversations if i don t isolate myself often i feel emotionally and mentally drained and can t focus anymore i wish it was okay to just be with others without interacting all the time especially verbally i have so much fun connecting through activities like games music cooking projects i spent so much of my life thinking being quiet was a problem and trying to fix it but pretending to be something you re not is exhausting i think i m gonna try to stop and just be who i am lol,social_anxiety

1pat64f,how do i ask people to hang out im 19m and ive struggled with making friends and having had any in seven years i have no friends right now but im trying to make them i am probably autistic and have bad social anxiety for some context at work ive been really talkative and most people like me there are some people im closer to than others and they have offered to do things for me and have hypothesized about us hanging out outside of work but we havent actually done anything i really want to hang out but idk how to transition from just talking at work to doing things outside of work i know i am overthinking it but my age and lack of friends are issues i am a little older than some of them 1 2 years so i am hesitant to be the one to initiate anything because i am an adult while they are in high school i also worry about the fact that if we were to hang out it would either be one on one which might be seen as weird to ask for or i have to wait for them to initiate it or for it to be a group event this is the closest ive been to having real friends in so long and i dont want to fuck it up,social_anxiety

1pas6wi,hanging out 1 x 1 feels like i m at the dentist maybe this is just for me to vent but i m feeling so unbelievably broken right now no one in my immediate life struggles with this anxiety the same way and i have no one to talk to about it lately ive been going out a lot by myself two to three times a week dancing at clubs networking making new friends the works it s really upped my confidence and i ve surprisingly had very little anxiety putting myself out like this after a year or two of pretty intense isolation however as soon as the idea of being around someone alone without the flashing lights of the club and the super loud music i literally cannot breathe people meet me and see me as this cool outgoing person but as soon as i m alone i freeze up feels like i m actually pulling teeth i hate it about myself so much i can even have an anxiety filled day and feel okay to go out and drink and party but as soon as someone asks if i want to meet up beforehand i instantly can t handle it anymore when i was single it was easier because intimacy could be used as a crutch but now that i m married i feel like it s actually impossible which i hate i don t want to feel like i have to make out with someone because i m too awkward to say anything does anyone else struggle with the same thing how do i move past this bro im almost 30 i can t have nightclubs be my main form of socialization forever,social_anxiety

1pag4f9,to the stranger who eased my social anxiety i am a highschool student currently taking steps to signing up to universities abroad so a few months ago i had to take an ielts test i forgot my passport which was required which made me lose a lot of money for the test i missed my mom scolded me in front of the other candidates in the room the announcement echoed throughout the building and everyone left to take the test my mom quickly followed after grumbling as she left the building humiliated i stood outside the english center alone leaning against the wall while trying to calm myself it was soon after that a middle aged man approached me he was smoking too near and i hated cigarettes but i put up with it because i didn t want to come off as unfriendly he asked me what happened and i explained he told me he was the father of one of the candidates and that his son was going to apply for a scholarship abroad i replied i was on the same boat and for the first time i managed to throw back words normally to a complete stranger we had a nice conversation where he told me about his stories of working abroad it made me realise was this really what i was afraid of this whole time i am perfectly fine on my own after all i needed no friend to speak on behalf of me the next days i tried quipping in some words with strangers what made you start a juice business to the lady who owned the orange juice stand i often bought from your dog is so cute what s his name to my neighbor who walked the dog often what books do you like reading to the kid hanging in the public library i still hesitate to speak sometimes but exposure therapy worked way better than expected starting it may be like a leap of bravery but man does it only get better so thank you to the man who approached me whoever your name is what seemed like a normal conversation to you that you probably forgot the next day already was a push for me to take the leap,social_anxiety

1paf844,it s scary to leave messages on the internet hi folks i ve read a lot of stories about people struggling with social interactions in real life i feel the same way but i ve never seen anyone say they re scared or awkward about leaving messages on the internet for me it s like i just can t write anything on the internet: comment messages in a big group even just like or dislike sometimes or post anything i m scared because i don t know how people will react i can t see their emotions so all i can do is guess what they re thinking what if they misunderstand me do you ever feel like this how did you get over it i doubt i ll get many replies because the people who worry about this as much as i do probably can t bring themselves to post either i get it our profiles are empty lol well at least you ll know you re not alone you won t believe it but this is probably my first post in years that s just how afraid i am of social interaction even online,generalized_anxiety
1paeife,i m an introvert but it hurts to be alone i stopped studying after finishing high school not by choice but for other reasons the thing is since then i haven t had an environment where i can socialize not even a course or any other place where a teenager young adult would normally spend his time socializing and meeting people obviously i tried to make friends online and currently i have three good friends i even tried dating apps but i didn t get a single match on any of them not even those where everything is supposed to be slower or for shy people but sometimes the lack of physical interaction weighs heavily on me i obviously talk to and see my family but not people i consider friends or even romantic interests i had a long distance relationship during those four years but it eventually ended and it made me miss that physical connection even more i m already a very shy and introverted person i might have had social anxiety i m even too shy to want to go to a psychologist and get diagnosed but now i m 18 years old and i feel like my entire youth has been wasted and i don t know exactly when things will change every time i have to go outside even if it s with my family i get incredibly panicked my stomach hurts my hands sweat and my mind races sometimes i just can t sleep thinking about that day or how much i wish that date would happen so i could go back to normal the easiest answer would be just go out and meet people like you but my shyness my insecurity and the fact that i like being alone even though it sounds contradictory leave me feeling stuck no matter what option i consider my family knows that a little but they don t know how much this affects me it s also difficult to manage when i also feel depressed sometimes and especially with the pressure of deciding what to do now that i m 18 it s huge i don t know if i m a burden to them or if there s a magic job for people like me sometimes i feel literally cursed because every option i try either fails or is simply impossible in some way,social_anxiety
1padouj,i don t want friends this might just be a vent post lmao apologies in advance if i sound like i m just complaining i am m17 almost turning 18 and have no driver s license job or friends 2 years ago i developed paranoia that inhibits me from forming relationships i do not want people to get close to me i am afraid of rejection so ultimately i avoid trying to connect altogether the process of making friends is physically demanding and requires emotional stability a bit of charisma can go a long way but i am not charismatic for me actually trying ends in unnecessary tension awkwardness and discomfort for both people and i realize that this is self sabotaging because i tend to withdraw if i feel like i m imposing on an established friend group when i haven t been invited they see that i m guarded because i anticipate rejection and they understandably distance themselves from me it is much easier to isolate yourself from others when all you ve received is judgment and condescension i recognize this is a very pessimistic way of thinking about it a bit cringey but there is no incentive for me to make friends when my social anxiety was at its worst i would never talk to people because i knew that if i did then it was another opportunity for my classmates to tease or mock me for my stuttering i constantly feel like a burden and always feel like people have to tolerate me when i m socializing i m so embarrassingly awkward that it makes it impossible for someone to like me plus not getting along with a person damages my reputation and theirs because if they do decide to befriend me they ve now just associated with an antisocial loser who can t provide value the person you ve talked to knows you re weird and are more likely to make fun of you though i could be projecting food for thought but why would they want to talk to you it s not like you re the only person millions of people are secure and capable of maintaining a healthy relationship that will uplift both parties on one hand i want connection but i m scared that the person i am friends with will only like me conditionally,social_anxiety
1padaiz,anyone else forgets how to walk in public i always feel really awkward walking in public with all the cars honking people walking wind and sun getting into my eyes making me tear up my nose running from the cold i feel like i lose my balance and can t walk in a straight line anymore it s like sensory overload i m never sure what to do with my hands so i just keep wiping my eyes for no reason and i don t know where to look when people are walking towards me or in front of me walking in public is always a very painful experience for me does anyone else experience this,social_anxiety

1pa33k5,trying to overcome my final boss of social anxiety: dancing in public i ve had really bad social anxiety my whole life and i ve made a lot of progress i ve been able to go to concerts huge wrestling events and my career requires me to be social the final boss for me has always been dancing even when i was on dance or cheer teams when i was younger that part was always really difficult i used to think part of the problem was the genres of music i was trying to dance to i went to a club once and while everyone else was dancing i just felt frozen and awkward if i tried to do a dance move it would barely last two seconds because it felt so unnatural maybe it was the newer hip hop music they weren t the songs i felt comfortable moving to i think dancing to older hip hop r b latin or house genres might be easier for me but honestly it could just be that it was in public recently i ve been fascinated by people who can just dance in clubs or open spaces and i started thinking about what it would be like to do that at i have a concert coming up with a house music dj set so i started watching videos from soulection zack fox sets etc to see how people at those today i got up and started emulating what i saw my brain is very technical so i can t just move to the music i need to see what it looks like to understand it and honestly it was so fun i got a good workout and it actually brought me joy i think i might start doing this regularly i just kind of wanted to share this but if anyone has any advice by any chance i d love to hear it maybe this is my final boss but maybe it s easier for somebody else out there,social_anxiety

1p9wusy,why did my communication suddenly drop even with close friends i ve noticed a sudden decline in my ability to talk to people especially close friends i used to have effortless long conversations with one friend in particular and now i barely speak or avoid talking because i freeze overthink or forget what to say it s not due to a fight or loss of interest the comfort is gone for no clear reason it feels like: hesitation before speaking searching too long for the right words fumbling or blank mind awkwardness avoiding conversations i m trying to understand: what causes this shift specifically with familiar people is this a form of social anxiety burnout overthinking or something else what actually helps restore natural conversation flow without forcing it would appreciate input from anyone who has gone through this or understands the psychology behind it,social_anxiety
1p9wlbr,do i have social anxiety first off i imagine this is probably a question asked daily on this sub so i apologize i also apologize if i articulate my thoughts badly and yall don t understand what i say because i m also in the dark about why this is happening ok it started at around the previous grade everyone took these extracurricular sports events me and those who did were exempt from coming to school so i ended up going a semester and a half with literally just me alone in the lecture halls fast forward to now i am in the first sem of 12th grade and i am js extremely paranoid of talking to people i don t know why i feel this way i m pretty much close friends with everyone in my class and have a long history with them but whenever they hangout or do something i m just so afraid of going up and talking with them so i end up sitting in class all day and even they find it weird why i seclude myself and even i do too past few days i have been getting better but i still overthink like crazy about what i m gonna say and if my opinions are even welcome and i dread coming to school because this cycle of worrying and feeling pressured that i m not talking enough is really fucking draining at times i don t know why this is happening i m friends school friends i should clarify i don t hangout with them outside school with them but i m js so nervous and it genuinely baffles how people can js go and say whatever s on their minds sorry if i m unclear i don t really know what s going on either if i had to take my best guess on what s wrong i think i might say lack of any self confidence and or overthinking edit:if yall know any in the moment tricks to relax and stop overthinking like meditation or something pls tell me,generalized_anxiety
1p9w41p,i just started college again and safe to say my social anxiety is going away it s the end of the semester and of course i was a bit shy in one of my classes but but of course there is one who i never have a chance to talk to anyone since it s only an hour and once a week and they re kinda boring but then i along came a class where i got to talk to people i got really comfortable like a few months passed and they say and waved and i said hi like i even got the courage to talk to someone i liked and go up to them and start talking and it s sometimes hard to do that for me yay and also i notice my old high school senior self is returning who was very social well o i have some friends still from before one off motivations or talk to my peers was the only thing i will regret is not talking to them the reason why people don t make friends is because they never even bother talking to them would it matter in 5 000 years so i m like actually went up to people i m interested in being friends with and yeah now i m comfortable enough to even talk i mean yeah the semester is almost over it may not be the same people but still i am proud of myself but i notice it s easy for me to go up to someone who seems to be interested in me even asked for their socials,social_anxiety

1p9tjeg,i think everyone hates me this started in covid years i was at home the time and i didn t speak to anyone like none of my classmates unless i wanted notes from them and then we started offline classes and i realised that i have become very socially anxious i started overthinking everything i said sometimes what i thought of saying didn t come out the way i wanted or i would say the wrong thing without meaning to which led to so many awkward moments in high school eventually i just gave up talking and started reading books in school i i was in two schools over the last 3 years of hs and i found some differences in the first one that i was in during the shift from online to offline despite the awkward moments kids were largely very friendly i had good one on one convos with them just that when we were in a group they would just not hear me even after i repeated what i said not respond to my texts in the class grp etc i felt like a wall to them i don t know if it was intentional or not coz i used to wear a mask and maybe they didn t hear me properly and i couldn t exactly open up with them either coz they had all kept in touch and had become this big grp and they couldn t match my interests either i wasn t friends with anyone that year but when i would have my lunch alone they would call me to sit with them but it was out of pity as when i sat with them they would talk amongst themselves and not really care about me in my second school i thought i could have a fresh start bcoz the people in my class matched my wavength but the people who were interested in the same things as me like i found a grp and i thought we could be friends but one of the girls did not like me she made it very obvious she would give a blank stare or ignore things i said and only respond to the other girls and other people would be nice to me but the second someone they wanted to speak to would come they would ignore me all of a sudden and then there were people who were nice to me throughout but they were part of a big grp in school and didn t match my imterests either so again i ended up having no friends some girls were nice to me in the beginning but towards the end of the year would start being cold to me and would be nice to me again during some days like graduation day lol one girl just took one look at me and just decided to look down whenever i said something and just didn t respond to me it was very annoying i never had the courage to ask why they hate me coz in my memory i never did anything to them on purpose the hate was just for no reason and i was just scared to hear the actual reason it still bothers me sometimes i am meeting the same kind of people in college now and on some days like today i just feel everyone i come around just hates me i am aware that it could just be that they aren t in the mood sometimes or i may be overthinking the blank stares i get but there are people who do this intentionally but why always me i ust want to know if other people go through it as well and how did they get past it i am sorry for the long post it s my first time posting i just want people to have full context before commenting,social_anxiety

1p9nryb,venting advices are appreciated i am a 25 female i have been battling with depression social anxiety and anxiety all my life ever since i can remember i don t believe i was a happy child i always wanted to be social and to have a free soul i feel like that s what i am hiding under all my insecurities and problems as a teenager i always thought i would get over this mindset that i have but it never happened i went to therapy doctors and i got advice from people nothing worked i am still in therapy i thought i was seeing the silver lining at the end but after a while i am back in this shit place i tried everything i tried to be active have a healthy life i did yoga i went to the gym i meditated i ate clean i won t lie the healthy life actually made me feel better but i could never get the pressure on my chest out it s always there before i started my healing journey i thought that pressure on my chest was guilt i thought i was experiencing guilt about being alive doing what i wanted to do it always felt like i needed to be living according to other people s rules i became bitter and jealous of those who had free souls i hated pretty women i hated my face i hated everything about myself i hated how i acted how i walked how i moved i hated that i hated myself i became insecure about people knowing my secret that i hated myself i wanted to seem confident care free happy just like i always imagined i ve been in relationships where people took advantage of me i wasn t treated right but i stayed because i felt like i was a half life without a person i became addicted to sharing my life with someone and that person protecting me against all the evil of the world i knew it wasn t realistic i just hoped because it was easier than healing i let myself go started doing drugs and become severely underweight started smoking going to parties and being someone that i wasn t i just wanted to fit in i just wanted to feel how real peace felt i abused drugs so much that it started becoming a problem i left my boyfriend and his friends it was the most toxic environment for me and i lived in it for a year then i started my healing journey gained weight stopped drugs started the gym and painting i met a guy online he was different from everybody else i immediately felt that we had a soul tie i believed we were meant together he drained me i just wanted to stay with him i wanted to be with him and get married to him so i stayed whatever he did i kept seeing him i blamed myself for every argument we had for some reason he wasn t leaving me as well he was constantly mad at me and became really manipulative he didn t leave until one day that s when i learned he was in a relationship the whole time even though it felt like hell for a few months after he left i felt so light afterwards i started working hard so that i could study abroad i believed it was going to solve all my problems the funny thing is that i always did the same thing i changed schools a few times i wanted to be in a new place because i believed that i was going to forget everything and start clean when i came to a whole new different country for my studies i felt this adrenaline i was hungry to meet people have conversations i couldn t believe what was happening i wasn t overthinking about my interactions i didn t have anxiety i was so happy to be in a new country a fresh white clean page i met my now boyfriend he is thoughtful amazing the best thing i could ask for he cares for me and loves me but after a while i started being so insecure again i believed i didn t deserve him and i wasn t enough for him i started feeling like an ugly girlfriend next to a very handsome man i started to struggle at school i became so overwhelmed that it paralyzed me i couldn t do anything the stress of being in a new country and trying to settle made me feel even worse i was just existing at this point i started feeling disconnected from myself i stopped seeing the new friends that i made i felt more and more insecure as people and my boyfriend got to know me better as it made me feel more vulnerable i wanted to take a step back and i did take a step back from friendships but i felt too attached to my boyfriend again feeling like i couldn t breathe or do anything without him i knew that was a problem i constantly talked about my attachment issues with my therapist but i am a bystander in my life i watch as things happen because my fears outweigh my reason i let them control me now i feel defeated i am opening up to my boyfriend a lot more but i am terrified of him seeing the actual me which is this ugly insecure girl i am in the cycle of self sabotaging again i know it and feel it coming stronger but i am paralyzed i don t know what to do i am so tired of living the fact that i will never unalive myself makes me feel more stuck i can t believe i have to live through this i feel so defeated i am in an lovely country have an amazing boyfriend in a major that i like i have a roof over my head i am healthy and able bodied i have a supportive family i can feed myself as ungrateful as it is i am not happy and i feel like i will never be truly happy what is happiness you might ask i don t expect anything crazy i just want to be confident in myself and be grateful for what i have i don t know how i don t know if there s

1p9e9kk,social anxiety life is starting to take its toll on me i love people and feel super good when i have a good interaction with someone but sometimes its hard for me to interact like i dont show it but afterwards im constantly replaying the interaction and i always just worry about what people think of me because of things ive done in the past if i was ever mean or was weird what also makes me sad is how old versions of me live in so many peoples heads im in high school and i got bullied in freshman year because i was really socially inept i loved so many people i met in my exploratory classes and shit but no one really gravitated towards me because i was so fuckin awkward i kinda just got picked on and i didnt realize it at the time like what little innocence i had was destroyed im a lot different now and actually do stuff but just thinking about who i used to be and how thats probably still affecting me today hurts basically im always just swallowed in my own self doubt and i feel unappreciated sometimes i just cry cuz i feel like i cant interact properly and it makes me sad like i always just think like im sorry for being awkward dont think i dont like you im sorry people think im funny and making people laugh is one of my favorite things but a lot of times i use it as a way to hide what im going through like i always bottle up my feelings and then when im in my room i just end up crying cuz after a while i cant push it down cant handle the pressures of daily social life other people see me as a happy person people dont know that im sad a lot from being insecure and even if they werent trying to hurt my feelings the littlest mean comment can fuck me up pretty good if its from someone i like trust i wish theyd see what it does to me i cry a lot for a guy haha too much nowadays,social_anxiety

1p9d18j,family gatherings put me in fight or flight 27f i went into the holiday season with the intention of tackling this fear head on and being more social at family gatherings to give some context i went to my dads we have a complex history of a strained relationship but i ve made a point to work on the relationship because he is the only parent i have left my mom died 9 years ago needless to say my moms death added a layer to my already layered trauma and i ve always been more of an introvert but i can be extroverted around the right people but i don t fit in with my dad s side of the family they re in my opinion very closed minded and i m a failure in their eyes a woman who hasn t found a man to take care of her and hasn t pushed out any kids when i walked into the house no one acknowledged me and it felt so uncomfortable my heart instantly started to race and i immediately found a place to hideout i pretty much talked to the kids because i feel like they re the least judgmental and the easiest to talk to but i m sure that makes me look weird i feel like nothing but an embarrassment when i don t socialize but it s like i have this wall in me i get so nervous and when i don t feel like i have anything meaningful to add or i don t feel like the people around me even care about what i have to say why would i say anything at all it just stinks because i want my dad to love me and i feel like all i do is disappoint him however at the same time he disappoints me a lot too i could hardly eat anything because i was so nervous the whole time i feel cursed with this on the drive home i balled my eyes out and thought of all the reasons i should unalive myself,social_anxiety

1p9ai6i,people stare a lot nowadays has anyone else felt uncomfortable about how people look at you in public nowadays like especially at the malls like i can t be the only one who noticed but everyone just looks in public and stares and it makes me really uncomfortable im really pretty but it s just there facial expressions that make me uncomfortable and makes me want to avoid eye contact i don t remember it being like this or this bad when i was younger back then i feel like people didn t stare or look as much like they do nowadays they probably did it back then maybe it s because i wasn t socially conscious yet i was a kid so peoples glances and stares didn t bother me back then i can t be the only one who noticed this tho people do it more now and it bothers me it s like everyone is copying each others facial expressions like what s wrong with this generation does anyone else notice this too or get uncomfortable especially the men be doing it the worst they stare and mug at me or smirk or have a rbf,social_anxiety

1p945p6,i don t care i don t care about what happens to me bad or good things end up the same way for me regardless in the past when i ve put my best effort into things i ve been rewarded with abysmal failure when i do nothing the same thing happens i ve accepted that this is the way i am due to this disorder and it will not get better i ve tried therapy medications exposure supplements and many other things but none of it has ever worked consistently i feel as though i should ve died a long time ago and i m living on stolen time i don t feel like my life is bad or good i don t feel like i m living any kind of life i spend every day in my room smoking weed doing the same thing over and over and over being a dependent and needy man child who s 25 years old and i still rely on my parents for everything it s 2 pm and i ve spent the day so far lying down feeling sorry for myself and talking to chatgpt about my emotions it s pathetic when i ve tried to work i was fired twice due to my employer stating my incompetence and anxiety even after my last employer made almost every accommodation and tried their best to support me ultimately i couldn t handle the stress of the job and was fired not told that i could voluntarily resign as they had done for other coworkers i was terminated i don t blame them for their decision as my performance from their perspective was abysmal i was constantly shaking and couldn t speak even simple sentences to clients when i received the report the reasons for my termination were outlined in detail including what each of the people who were training me thought when i had got this job i was so happy for once because i was doing something totally out of my comfort zone that required interacting with a lot of people i thought i was personally progressing well as my training went on and i was really proud of myself and felt something was finally changing but reading the report it looks like i was never made out for the job in the first place and i was never actually doing well from their perspective they just wanted me to succeed i guess because they thought i was nice that s all that anyone has ever said about me oh he s nice they don t know anything more than that it s like i don t exist already i feel like the only people who really care about me in the world are my parents and it s because they have to they have a biological instinct to care for me i wish there was a way they could accept that leaving would be the better option for me my brain isn t built for this world i am too sensitive and the world is too unfair and harsh of a place i can t kill myself because i know that a parent losing a child is one of the worst things a human can experience they are the only people who have supported me for this long yet i give them nothing in return except for making their lives worse by making them constantly worried and sad by repeatedly using harmful coping skills mainly drugs and lying to them about various things i guess if i can t kill myself and my brain is flawed i might as well use whatever substance is available for me to make me feel better and i hope that i eventually get cognitive damage so i become more stupid and less aware of whatever is happening here,generalized_anxiety

1p8i7u4,how to talk to my crush i m kinda confused about whether this shy girl likes me as i said in my other posts she seems to be staring at me a lot and i connected the dots about why i think she has a crush on me the first sign was her and her friend the one i know looking back at me on the walk and laughing then she kept looking at me both her and her friend at the start of this year she was staring at me all the time when we came back to school i noticed she was talking to this gay guy during p e and she was dead on staring at me while i was running in soccer then in class i was looking at my friend when the shy girl s friend looked at me i looked back and she laughed i know that friend definitely doesn t like me as i talked to her a lot before but ever since the shy girl started staring at me the friend started acting weird too a week before halloween i counted the shy girl looking at me 10 times it s not my imagination today she was looking at me a lot while she was by herself even when people were working in groups she was alone or just with one friend and still looking at me it s starting to make me mad and also feel sorry for her i know what it s like to not have anyone i used to be really introverted and had anxiety from ages 13 to 15 but i made some friends who helped a lot now everyone sees me as the chill guy who doesn t talk much but can have a bit of fun anyway on monday i tried to talk to her on the walk i went beside her and said how are you she didn t answer so i just looked at her she turned her head we made full eye contact i looked away she looked away and then i walked over to someone else i m pretty sure it came out weird because i can t talk to anyone unless they talk to me first in the next two classes she was still looking at me this week she keeps looking at me anytime i talk to a teacher in the computer room i saw her looking at me when i was by myself one time my friend was behind her and when i was walking by she was by herself she made eye contact i made eye contact it felt like she thought i was going up to her i didn t know why but it felt like she wanted to talk to me and i probably seemed like an ass for not doing anything i don t know why anyone would like me and i only connected the dots a month ago also her friend in 5th year got her to talk to me on one of those old phones this is how obvious it is when women like me i m like why to her friend and she said just talk smiling i go on the phone and say umm hi and i hear the shy girl giggle and say hi then her friend said say something else and because i m so socially awkward i think i said how are you or i said nothing i don t know what to do i think i m gonna try again today i went out the door before her to go to the other campus and guess who somehow catches up to me out of nowhere her just a tiny bit behind me not too close could she have been trying to talk to me to be honest i d want to be friends with her before even thinking about dating but she is my type a shy woman with dark black hair and a bit of a tan i d really like to get to know her but anytime i m near her i get butterflies my heart starts racing and it probably happens to her too i m sick of my social anxiety but it s worse around her i hate the feeling but it would be nice to take the risk even if it just leads to us being friends i hated seeing her sitting alone at the park today i just know how she feels having no one we re alike in that way we keep to ourselves and talk only when spoken to hopefully things work out but i want ideas on how to talk to her and how to get her to talk to me,social_anxiety

1p7piii,fundraising street sales is like therapy that pays you it s so great i wish i did this 10 years ago i m 32 now i actually interviewed for a fundraising job 10 years ago but it was a large group interview where we had to pitch in front of lots of people and i was scared as hell and stumbled completely my anxiety won and made me look a fool fast forward to 3 months ago my misery reaching peak after being rejected for being nervous on a date i was totally fed up with myself i was tired of being a mouse and hiding my true self to people i started going to the gym eating right going outside more then found the courage to join a local charity to fundraise it was smaller group session this was manageable for me i got the job barely then the first week came i got a sign up literally the first person that i stopped by complete beginners luck after that nothing just fear of approaching people but 1 on 1 conversations weren t that bad especially if i could hide behind the easy pitch so i got like 8 over next 3 weeks during this time not much changed i gained a little confidence but as i said i hid behind a pitch but then 1 day i was feeling a bit more merry i was happy about life and the present moment so i decided to let loose spontaneously and i became literally the most charismatic version of me i ve ever witnessed like i was magnetic for 1 hour and i felt free in the world for the rare few times since childhood i had wanted to quit 10 before this day but something kept telling me to push on this charasmatic day was not replicated the second day hell it only came back to me in about a week back to my old patterns of thought and hiding behind the shell but the gap between those free days has been getting shorter and shorter ever since like my brain is learning that people aren t scary anymore i m at about 50 50 days when i m confident days when i m not in my new fundraising gig when working with very charismatic confident people i still notice i hide myself like i m intimidated by what they think but i keep letting loose i keep forcing myself to focus on my validation and not others and it s fucking working bit by bit i literally can t wait to go back into work now it s so thrilling growing socially and becoming more confident the job becomes like a drug like a life changing therapy that you get paid to do i recommend anyone doing it if they can and if not build yourself up to do it social anxiety is about not being proud of yourself enough to be vulnerable in front of others to show your true authentic self learn to respect a little thing about yourself could be changing your diet going gym etc then try fundraising maybe for a day a week volunteering but it s key you keep at it the trouble with social anxiety it takes time to change ask yourself honestly are you progressing fast enough how much time do we have left,social_anxiety

1p7gmyh,should i go to this event hello so im at crossroads with a situation and i think explaining to people who understand would help me decide so i m graduating highschool next year which is already scary and in my country there s this big thing around it it involves doing soo many things going out constantly etc in about two weeks there s this thing they call something like the welcome to our prom year every school about to be in their last year goes each with their classmates you have to make your specific clothes and then you just go and drink and party from afternoon i think until it s time to go to the club everyone goes to this thing it s like mandatory without being it it s the only thing my classmates have been talking about since the start of the year i know i should probably go but here s my situation: i don t have friends or anyone i talk to at school only these two girls who do group projects with me because they know i don t have anyone and even they are like omg look at our super friend obviously as a joke a couple of other classmates also make those jokes about me or that im the excluded one im not really that bothered by it because i know it s simply the truth and i don t care about them to feel that bad it s not like i believe they re anything other than a means to an end to make it short some classmates had tried in the past to include me but i was so scared and ashamed i rejected them until they stopped asking so i really don t want to go because there s no one i could talk to it would be very awkward i would leave feeling really down everyone would go to talk with their friends from others schools etc but in the other hand it s my last year of school and i don t want to be locked in my house forever i want things to change i just don t know how to make the first step or with who also i know my mother would be really mad at me even if she s used to this from me and she would probably be cruel about it tell me what you would do in my place or helped me decide what to do,social_anxiety
1p7fdne,why strangers are sometimes easier to talk to than friends the paradox of stranger intimacy many people find it easier to share deep feelings with strangers than with those closest to them this isn t a flaw in your relationships it s human nature the weight of history existing relationships come with context friends and family know your past your patterns your usual self this history can feel constraining when you re struggling with something new or out of character fear of changing the dynamic revealing struggles to people in your life risks altering how they see you will they still respect you will they worry too much will it burden them these concerns create barriers to honest communication the clean slate effect strangers offer a fresh perspective without baggage they judge you only on what you share in that moment not colored by years of accumulated impressions no stakes no pressure there s freedom in knowing you ll never see someone again you can be completely honest without worrying about ongoing consequences or awkward future encounters professional distance the slight formality of stranger interaction can actually make vulnerability easier it s like therapy the structured distance creates safety for emotional exploration unbiased listening friends may have their own agendas or opinions about your situation strangers can offer a neutral ear without the complications of invested interest the gift of anonymity anonymous communication takes this further without even the social dance of introduction and small talk you can dive straight into what matters breaking the isolation sometimes we just need to say things out loud or write them down to someone anyone strangers fulfill this need without the emotional complexity of close relationships understanding why strangers feel safe doesn t mean your close relationships are lacking it means recognizing that different connections serve different needs both matter,generalized_anxiety

1p7d68y,i did something i m extremely terrified of doing so as someone with social anxiety my biggest nightmare is presentations i did them a whole lot in highschool but unlike some people say i never got used to it or anything it was always the same crippling anxiety all over again and sometimes i got physically sick over it when i got to college my fear of doing them was so much worse that i just didn t do it and of course i failed my classes but today i decided i had to do it it wasn t super complicated so i decided i could do it let me just say it went terribly when i went to sit back down i overheard some people making fun of me wich made me feel worse but i m still proud of myself because this is such a scary thing for me and i somehow managed to get out of the house and face my fears unfortunately i have more presentations coming up and because this one went so bad i m still as scared as before if not more but the whole point is that i did it so i think that counts for something i guess i just wanted to share this with people who understand how big of a deal this is everyone else would just think i m silly for dramatizing it :,social_anxiety
1p7d1c9,living with social anxiety feels like carrying an invisible weight there was once a time when i thought that social anxiety just meant being shy or awkward in social situations however i now see that social anxiety is much more complicated and difficult to manage than that social anxiety means standing at the entrance to a room filled with people while your chest feels tight you want to speak but cannot get the words out of your mouth you can replay everything you said hours after the fact over and over wondering if what you said was weird you are constantly either avoiding phone calls canceling plans and then feeling guilty about spending time alone because you want to connect but panic when you re trying to make that connection ever happen to me the worst part of having social anxiety wasn t the panic attacks but the feeling of being an observer instead of living your life i ve been tackling from different angles and ways i keep rack of my anxiety symptoms practicing my breathing techniques and writing down everything i think of throughout the day have given me small victories all those small victories have led to me making progress toward overcoming my social anxiety,panic_disorder

1p798iy,struggling with social anxiety hey everyone i ve been trying to push myself socially so i ve started going to badminton games with strangers i m a beginner and most people there play way better than me they try to guide me i try to respond politely but my social anxiety gets triggered badly here s the problem: when someone plays a great rally or hits a good shot everyone reacts naturally cheering laughing appreciating but i don t know how to react i either say yes good one very softly or don t react at all because i feel awkward and then i start thinking everyone must be judging me as rude or uninterested honestly i m not doing it from the heart i m reacting just because of fomo it all feels forced at the same time i can t focus on the game because my brain keeps running: what are they thinking about me am i too quiet am i making mistakes do i look weird as a beginner why can t i act normal like others i m trying my best to show up but every time i feel like i m incompatible with people or that i ll never be able to connect socially it hits my confidence really hard i also live alone so now i am thinking it would have been good if i will be living with someone or have some friends nearby has anyone else faced this how do you handle sports or group activities when your anxiety makes even small reactions difficult any advice would really help,social_anxiety
1p78lj7,what s the deal with me this is a long story so hear me out: there was a time in my life where i was social and thought i finally belonged somewhere my high school class before i never really felt truly in a community but having genuine fun with them and rediscovering the joy of interacting with people but i was still closed off and introverted then last year after failing at handling having a crush i decided: screw it i wanna come out to some people and i want him to know i like him eventually 2 people the whole class knew then and spread the rumor around however those days felt like i was free those days even if that happened were the best for me i was getting really active talking to people moved by excitement i said merry xmas to them talked to them about about my personal issues stuff i wasn t doing with anybody before then something felt off inside i thought that they were taking advantage of me and i blamed it on them on not setting boundaries and that feeling of energy rush being around people left i hated myself and my way of communicating now after a year i m scared to have autism to be different and when i talk i never say something personal about me i dunno if it s because i fear the past or whatever but there s always a context in which i think: if i say this people will react negatively example from today: i thought about coming up to the group i usually hang around in and casually start with: hey guys do you watch tv series i recently started hazbin hotel and damn it s good when there s a slight moment of silence and i don t speak over others then something pulled me off: don t creeps start up at people like that i thought screw it but i was left with a bitter taste in my mouth so i awkwardly stood there without saying a word until i went back to my seat and minded my own business it s stuff like that how can i break free from this constant pressure on me,social_anxiety

1p72620,feeling a physical reaction when talking to people my social anxiety is so bad that any kind of interaction with people socially or chit chat at work or even a work training about mental health makes me anxious i m even anxious to sit with collegues at lunch time because i realise how far behind i am in life and become hyper aware of my own life making and keeping friends seems impossible because again being in a social environment takes everything out of me i feel most comfortable alone or with my boyfriend i believe that my boyfriend is always there with me and doesn t judge me and will be there so that s why it s different,social_anxiety

1p6zil5,how to stop feeling like a gross weird alien first off hi to the maybe 2 people that will read this bc i m invisible and non existent everywhere and that includes the internet i was talking to my therapist earlier about my attachment issues and i feel like i m close ish to getting over the mental block of feeling like a weird emotionally stunted alien that repels everyone but i just can t get over the fact that i m 23 and still pathetically unable to socialize with people without being scared that i m coming off as weird or that i ll be ignored entirely especially since a couple of weeks ago i tried to reach out to someone that i wanted to be better friends with sent a meme and they didn t respond at all and today i posted in the group chat talking about something i enjoy a lot some other friends of mine have a modded minecraft server and it s become a hyperfixation of mine and similarly no one responded my therapist alluded to the possibility of me just being with the wrong friends but i live in a state where everyone s standoffish af and it s famously difficult to make friends wa so starting over from scratch doesn t appeal but i m honestly thinking of just leaving,social_anxiety

1p6x94p,how do i come to terms with being a generally undesirable person title basically i have made a big effort to put myself out there recently but the truth is just that there are always people more outgoing than me with better personalities than me who can just effortlessly do everything better than me and therefore draw in all the friends i have been going to this club 2 hours a week it is the only time of the week where i really talk to anyone the rest of the time i am just very lonely there have been a few times where i thought i was coming closer to making friends with people just to be hit with the realisation they have tens of people more sociable and more desirable as a friend than me so i don t really have a chance and i don t really see the point in going anymore because i know i will just forget how to talk and feel like my presence is embarrassing and unwanted the last couple weeks i didn t really say much to anyone and then i left the club feeling really bummed out which sucked because i always hype myself up and look forward to this one opportunity for connection in my week i have felt this way my whole life i tried joining a club in january as well and i just stopped turning up after a month when i realised how pointless it was i moved recently so thought i should try again but it is just the same as always: even when i try to talk my speech is disjointed and strange i have weird interests even when i meet other strange people it is like i am too alien to click with anyone and make real conversation i feel stunted by my social anxiety and autism my anxiety always gets the best of me and i freeze up i have basically no social life and no support group i also am referring to myself as undesirable in a romantic sense i just don t feel like i am ever going to really be wanted i really crave feeling wanted and desired in some capacity i am trying to get used to the fact it will never be fully reciprocated but i dont know how to without getting depressed i just feel very lonely lately as always and now i m up at 3am again with a churning feeling in my chest unable to sleep wishing i was someone else so i could live a normal life without this debilitating anxiety that prevents me from have any social life,social_anxiety
1p6wc0g,at almost 27 i feel too old and like it s too late to actually have friends and a social life i m getting closer to 27 and literally pretty much my whole life especially since i turned around 10 12 ish i ve never had friends because of my social anxiety i ve only ever had two ex best friends who i haven t even seen and talked to in over half a decade now because they have lives and families of their own other than them i ve not had a single friend and i m not kidding when i say that i have been spending all these years even back then too in my teens in my room or house in general bedrotting and being on my phone all the time or listening to music or watching something i ve never partied a day in my life i ve never been to a club or anything like that i ve never had a single friend group not even a friend group of only three people it was always only me one on one with either of my two ex best friends that s it that s been my social life i ve never even had a job because i m so scared of working in the public and having to deal with people i literally hardly have any actual memories of my youth to look back on at this point and i feel like it s way too late for me now i mean let s be real how many people truly begin to finally make friends and actually go out and do things with friends for the first time in their life in their late 20s and in their 30s not very many people most people have already had a gazillion friends and friend groups and have already gone out clubbing partying traveling and just overall living and having a social life by that point also by this point most people are starting to settle down so it s just not the same i ve already given up hope i m really gonna be be 30 fucking years old and never having had a single friend group and never having actually lived and gone out and done things with friends like clubbing traveling or just anything it doesn t even even have to be that it s really too fucking late for me isn t it when i see literally everyone else in their 20s having so many friends and friend groups always going out and doing something together or even just having chill hangouts at someone s place i just cannot relate at all at all i m extremely depressed and that s not exaggerating i feel completely doomed and hopeless i ll never have friends i ll never have a social life and i sure as hell won t even begin to try now at this point in my life it really is too late for me and there s no sugarcoating it it would be so fucking weird and embarrassing of me to finally begin making friends and finally going out more and having a social life at almost 27 when this is the around the age most people begin to settle down there s no point in trying i m just gonna live my entife fucking life not ever having had any friends and a social life and never making memories i m just doomed to bed rot in isolation and loneliness until i die there s no sugarcoating any of this for me it s too fucking late and at my age i wouldn t even be considered young anymore i can t even begin to try to have a youth now because it s fucking over my youth is fucking over so i don t have any other choice but to just fucking accept it and let myself continue to rot away in loneliness and isolation in my house in my room until i fucking die i ve already missed out on that stage of of my life and there s no fucking getting it back it s not like i can just lie and say i m 21 again just so i can give myself the illusion of having more time to finally make friends and go out and live nope i m almost 27 this is really it for me i had my chance at making friends i had my chance at making memories i had my chance of experiencing parties and clubs i had my chance of actually having a social life and leaving my house to be with friends but i fucking blew it i fucking blew it my time is up i m not even gonna fucking try because it s way too fucking late and i m way too fucking old now i hate this i fucking hate this why did i have to end up like this why me why me why me,social_anxiety

1p6s5an,23m stuck: no social anxiety but still can t connect 23 you male hello people from reddit it s my first time posting here and using reddit altogether i d like to post here for asking for help to understand myself and overcome a struggle we all have in common here: social interactions actually my post might get overlooked because what isn t lacking over here definitely is not people asking for help with social interactions but my case is a little different: i don t feel any bit of anxiety firstly here s some context: in my childhood i was contrary to what i stated above a really shy kid the kind one that would be quiet all the time talk to nobody and be overly nervous with social interactions with any person i was also very school smart and that alone made me even more socially anxious and feel out of touch with other people feel like i don t belong anywhere the fact that i was school smart made other kids bully me and exclude me that strengthened my isolation this fear of social interactions accompanied me until high school when i finished school and started to have my adult life my shyness vanished however nothing changed regarding my social interactions loneliness is something i have been struggling with since approximately 14 years old when somehow my mind shifted into a depression that extended until high school even though i don t feel any glimpse of anxiety among other people it s like my brain got used to thinking i m different i don t belong with people i don t have any common conversation subjects with them i lack social skills etc and despite not causing me anxiety: i also tend to think that i m boring they will reject me for being boring despite the fact i understand that all these thoughts are false and residual from my childhood i don t seem internalize the opposite of these thoughts i somehow know that one of the ways to overcome maladaptive thinking patterns is to challenge yourself with other thoughts and force behaving i plan a long time ago to start conversations with people but my inner voice comes saying what are you going to start a conversation about the worst part is i don t feel any anxiety as i stated i m in this company for one year now i did excellent in the interview showing a lot of social skills contrary to my inner voice but i still feel stuck it s like i prove to myself i can do it however that doesn t sink in has anyone experienced something similar,social_anxiety

1p6o1gy,nervous laughter i deal with this 1 2 times per month where when my social anxiety is bad i ll give a bit of a nervous laugh to someone instead of answering them back if i m just passing by them rather than being in a full blown conversation it happens on occasion when i don t hear what they said and i know they re expecting a response it s like some sort of reflex and then i feel embarrassed and also then worry about potentially offending them once it happens it also happened recently while walking a dog i was pet sitting the person opened up their arms when they saw the dog i was walking so i started to anticipate social interaction i expected the person to greet the dog because i figured they must know her or at the least would probably say she s cute or something well they said good afternoon and instead of saying anything back i gave a little nervous laugh and kept walking now i am embarrassed and i am also worried they will either think i m weird or rude for laughing at them for no reason or else they ll think i think they re weird for no reason i was tired i was also anticipating something different to happen during the social interaction them greeting the dog i thought they must either know the dog or must think she s cute i think that is why i got nervous because i expected something else and was also real tired social anxiety makes no sense and now the person must think i m either weird or rude there was no reason for me to nervously laugh the person didn t do anything weird it was all because i was tired and was expecting a different social interaction this has happened a couple times when i ve passed someone and didn t hear what they said the pressure of having to respond but having no response feeling awkward for missing what they said equals me giving a bit of a nervous laugh and continuing my walk this happens only a couple of times a month but i hate the idea of people being possibly offended by it it s only a bit of a nervous laugh maybe the thing with the dog had something to do with the pressure of having to respond quickly as i was passing the person too since i expected the attention to be on the dog and not me i didn t have a response at the ready,social_anxiety

1p6lm9m,that time of the year company s christmas party in december i will attend my company s christmas party and i ve been anxious on and off about it since they first announced it 1 month ago i ve been at this job for around one year but i work remotely so i ve never met anyone of my colleagues i don t know if they have all met but they have certainly been working together for a long long time and some of them seem to be very close i especially dread the idea of showing up there at the venue not knowing if my teammates are already there not knowing anybody else and being completely incapable of starting a conversation i know it s just a party and if i have a good time great and if i don t it s not the end of the world but it s so exhausting being constantly anxious about these things i don t usually find myself having to go out of my comfort zone that much so when i do i try to take the chance to challenge myself a little bit also i must say that while working remotely is amazing it definitely doesn t help my social skills also this thing will last from 7pm to 1am who even wants to stay that long do you think it would be acceptable to just stay a few hours and then go i know i need to just see things from a different perspective but it s so difficult at times i m still thinking about a last minute excuse i already feel overwhelmed i wouldn t go but it appears to me you are quite encouraged to participate to these sort of things so i feel like i should show up at least this time and maybe skip the nexts,social_anxiety

1p6k6fg,rehearsed responses screwing you over anyone else deal with this i had to say good morning like every five minutes to customers while i worked in retail in the early morning so my automatic response to being greeted was good morning i just got out of the habit a year ago of doing that and i haven t worked there for years but for the longest time at 9 at night i d accidentally greet someone back with a good morning just because it was a rehearsed response i would do the same thing when i worked nights in retail say good evening or have a good night till i had the good morning rehearsed i quit that job while working mornings so that s what has stuck with me since till about a year ago but i still do it on occasion i ve noticed i m not the only one who has done this while having a job where the automatic response is good morning or have a good night i think most people understand but i still feel awkward i ve done this with a multitude of rehearsed responses now i m trying to slowly wean myself off of using rehearsed responses as my social anxiety decreases since i need them a little less i ended up moving to the state i would visit for years and an automatic response to where i was visiting would always be this state i am living in now when i lived elsewhere well i was tired the one day and told them i was visiting the state i live in now because this is the state i d always be visiting in the past i laughed and explained it was just my automatic response since i haven t lived here all that long in my defense i was real tired that day,social_anxiety
1p6ito6,i don t understand why i m constantly being excluded is it my fault at this point hi i need some advice sorry if this comes across like a sob story i just need another perspective i recently joined a new school along with a classmate that i was friends with at the beginning of the term most people from the school were decent and friendly to me and were clearly interested in talking to me too and i managed to make a small amount of friends fast forward to now people who were friendly generally treat me like hot air for example with the classmate i talked about we ll have one on one conversations sometimes but if we re in a big group she often pretend i don t exist generally now i get ignored and often excluded and i think people who i don t know me make me the butt of their jokes also i think that it s too late for me to try and make new friends i know that my social anxiety and personality is probably off putting and that i probably have many problems about myself that i don t even realise but i ve been in this exact situation so many times that there must be something wrong with me the worst part is that when i feel like my friends actually care about me and invite me to stuff i temporarily get happy and feel like i m not alone and that i don t have to worry anymore about it but the moment they drop me again i sink and spiral again and feel low i ve tried to convince myself that i m ok with being alone but i don t think i ll make it through 2 years of school like this tldr: joined a new school where most people were friendly at first but suddenly starting getting awkward and cold around me this situation has happened more than once so this has to be my fault at this point,social_anxiety

1p6bwjo,small talk is just soul crushing i ve never understood the culture of small talk tbh when you greet a stranger in a public place for some reason it s almost an obligation to ask them how they day is going and they always have to say that their day is going great both of you know that you don t really listen to each other in that moment both of you don t really care like you re not supposed to say that your day is not going well or ask clarifying questions it s just a mindless ritual that for some reason we keep doing again and again it feels like a bunch of corpo talk where you re supposed to say the right things to get a job offer after an interview if you meet a person with an intention to find new friends or a romantic relationship you start asking them questions about themselves what they do for living what their interests are etc what i noticed is that even at this stage when you re supposed to get to know them better even at this stage people keep talking in the small talk mode they say things but they don t expect you to listen to them it s like they are just talking out loud about themselves they don t expect any reaction they want to keep things at a surface level when everything is going well without going into details i value depth in conversations i find small talk boring i ask people clarifying questions if something doesn t make sense to me or i disagree with them they are almost shocked about it they say that i m different all i do is simply actually take my time to listen to them and take interest in what they have to say it s a simple act of showing some respect to another person isn t this how conversations are actually supposed to go,social_anxiety

1p5vzdy,it wouldn t be so bad if it wasn t for people themselves show any hint of social anxiety and it has a way of bringing out the bully in people this all would be bearable if people were more decent and compassionate but instead they almost subconsciously despise our vulnerability our very real condition whatever vulnerability they fight to mask is more reason for them to hate our unmasked anxiety it s all projection primitive power dynamics that most either don t realize they do or have no shame that they do it ultimately that s the irony of it all the severity of my social anxiety is very much caused by how much society despises it the same can be said about autistic people unmasking i m also an nd person we fear unmasking only because we ve been target when we did despite all the awareness about mental health actually showing symptoms still gets you target in school the workplace everywhere really we haven t come that far,social_anxiety
1p5v2u0,phobia of public speaking and social performance anxiety hi guys i am really desperate here and just need some advice from a community that might have some knowledge on the topic i am in my 4th year of med school and this issue is starting to really effect my mental health mood relationships and career i apologise in advance as this might be a slight rant to set the scene i always had social anxiety growing up for as long as i can remember judging myself and being scared of other peoples judgements however i seem to have developed a phobia of public speaking this started in high school after having a panic attack while giving a presentation up in front of the class this was pretty traumatising for me my voice trembled i sounded like i was going to cry and felt like it too and dissociated fully during and after the event i felt like i was exposed now every time i have to present or get called on to speak i relive the same experience full dissociation where it feels like my head is going to explode and an extreme sense of dread sometimes i feel like i m going to die genuinely it s traumatising every single time and its happening multiple times a week as we constantly have to give presentations in med school and in the hospitals i am able to suppress some of the physical symptoms via beta blockers propranolol but mentally it still tortures me i also now get panic attacks in some every day conversations and around my girlfriend so i can never relax now whenever i know i have a presentation coming up or an interaction where i will have to engage socially and i will be judged i can t stop thinking about it i obsess over it trying to find a way to avoid the anxiety hoping it won t come trying to find a cure for my condition and what i m going through i spend hours every day researching this it s like a full time job my primary fear is that i will be visibly nervous and others will see ie voice shaking blanking out crying throwing up or passing out or even just having to say sorry guys i can t continue then having to explain myself nobody knows i deal with this and i m terrified of being exposed i worry that the beta blockers aren t going to work because sometimes in the past the symptoms have appeared despite being on beta blockers and i want to stop taking beta blockers i m taking heavy doses 100mg propranolol every single day and its affecting my ability to exercise which is also affecting my mood i would just like to be able to speak and interact and live normally without having to numb my nervous system 24 7 i have done 100s of presentations and clinical exams and oral exams in med school where i am being evaluated yet i still haven t got over the fear in fact it s worse than ever after 7 years of dealing with this straight up exposure is not working i m just completely sick to death of it and want rid of it i am looking into treatment options but i m overthinking the therapy because i really want to get it right i have had a few initial consultations with therapists but their approach doesn t seem right they don t seem to understand me fully and i don t follow up with another session i also don t want to waste money i m a student on the wrong therapist if they re a bad fit or just a poor quality therapist i also wonder if online therapy might be better than in person due to finding better therapist i have heard about the limitations of cbt so i m cautious about engaging in cbt alone i feel like some deeper work may be necessary schema therapy ifs to address childhood trauma emdr to address acute traumatic events from specific public speaking events and somatic therapy to try and regain a sense of safety in my body again these are just some of my thoughts but it s just that all the options are overwhelming and i don t know how to find a therapist that can do all of this i have also just begun antidepressant medication sertraline in an attempt to try and combat some of the excessive rumination and worry which will hopefully make my phobia a bit better if anyone has any advice for me in my situation i would be really thankful it s just very hard figuring all of this out alone by myself and some support would be nice anything in terms of what kinds of therapy might be useful to help my specific performance anxiety situation around public speaking also any personal experiences or people you know of that have treated this and any resources which may be helpful,social_anxiety

1p5spv9,social anxiety mindsets hey guys over time i ve gathered some mindsets that really helped me deal with social anxiety here: 1 everyone likes me unless proven otherwise people generally only dislike you if they have a real reason 2 your anxiety signs aren t as visible to others as you think the ones sensitive enough to see are often sensitive enough to care 3 acknowledge your anxiety and don t try to deny it i am nervous and it is ok 4 most people aren t judging you in reality they re distracted tired stressed or thinking about themselves 5 exposure act despite fear and discomfort if you feel uncomfortable do it anyways because growth happens outside your comfort zone 6 mistakes are allowed and they are ok they make you appear more human and relatable to others 7 there will always be haters no matter what anyone does even the people you admire have their own haters hope this helps someone,social_anxiety

1p5ptcd,note to self: be prepared for conversation when wearing conversation starting accessories i m attracted to fun designs and accessories and i had one favorite thing with me at work a coworker surprised me with her enthusiasm for it and i went blank in my defense it was the end of a long work day the only thought in my head was getting home not on still being on and visible to other people couldn t remember where i got it or anything to say about it thought maybe i should compliment her on something but i drew a blank there too i said thanks punched out and ran out the door hopefully she doesn t think i m a stuck up bitch but i definitely earned an awkward label,social_anxiety
1p5p8qn,socially anxiety sucks this is me venting i don t expect anyone to give me advice but you are all very welcome to share your experiences on this topic i apologize if this post is confusing or hard to read i m writing this in my second language after a night where i couldn t sleep and my thoughts spiraled into deep self discovery i 18m only realized a month ago that i ve been struggling with social anxiety for as long as i can remember when i was young er everyone thought i was shy or said he doesn t like talking a lot and i guess it reinforced that idea in my mind from the age of 4 5 until 18 i ve grown up thinking i was just a shy person however about a month ago i tried mdma with three of my closest and almost only friends it let me experience what it s like to communicate without my own body and mind working against me for no reason i could speak my mind freely without my brain immediately dismissing all thoughts and leaving my mind blank i didn t have any nervousness or tightness in my chest i felt like a new person a person i ve always wanted to be but never thought i d be able to be i m not sure if the drug changed me into someone i actually am not or maybe all it did was lift my social barriers but i really hope it s the latter and it is possible for me to become that kind of person after that whole experience i discovered that i m not just shy looking back there are moments where i can be one of the most confident people in the room while sober i thought i was shy but shyness doesn t take over your whole body the way social anxiety does since then i ve been acknowledging my anxiety and trying to work towards overcoming it although it truly feels impossible now about the reason i am writing this post recently the four of us did mdma again this time however i told them about me realizing that i don t talk a lot because i have social anxiety they told me how much they like talking to me and how they wish i d speak more along some other nice things you have no idea how hard i try it feels iike my head becomes an empty void as soon as i interact with someone no matter how long i ve known them it makes me cry when i think about all the missed opportunities for emotional connection they feel close to me but i struggle to feel the same level of connection back no matter how much i want to and i don t know how to explain it i feel like i ve been isolating myself without meaning to and i don t know how to put that feeling into words i don t want to glamorize drugs so i have to add that mdma didn t fix me but it revealed something that i didn t even know i was searching for i also started thinking about what could have caused my anxiety then i remembered something from when i was around 4 my dad was cheating on my mom and for whatever reason kissed his lover outside of the car while me and my sister 1 were in the backseat at that age i had no idea what was going on but later i casually said to my mom something along the lines of daddy s got a new lady it lead to a very difficult divorce i blame both of them for cheating and fighting right in front of me and my sister i think i punished myself for making my parents break up and subconsciously decided that talking too much is dangerous and this might be the reason i developed social anxiety at a young age i know it s not my fault but what if hadn t been a dumbass and just kept that one sentence to myself how much better could my life have turned out something positive to end this depressing post: i m grateful for my friends and i will try my absolute hardest to keep them and not distance from them i m also glad i finally discovered all this about myself while there s still so much life ahead of me,social_anxiety

1p5ei0q,i get really uncomfortable around guys and i want to fix it any advice i m a senior girl and i realized i have a strange problem i went to an all girls middle school so i literally didn t talk to any guys my age for over three years when i moved to a co ed high school i suddenly found myself seeing every guy only as a potential romantic interest instead of just another person i don t know why but it just happens automatically i m totally fine in group conversations but the moment it becomes an one on one interaction with boys i get really uncomfortable and want to leave what s weird is that i m completely normal around my gay guy friends whether it s a group chatting or not there were actually a lot of guys i genuinely liked as people and wanted to be friends with but because of this weird avoidance i couldn t get close to them some of them even approached me first and i wanted to talk too but i always ended up pulling away maybe this happened because i grew up in an all girls environment my idea of boys was basically shaped by rom coms dramas and novels so when i actually met real teenage boys i didn t know how to handle it i thought time would fix it but it s already passed almost 3 hears in high school and things barely changed i don t even care about dating right now i just want to get along with everyone regardless of gender but i can t seem to get past this discomfort it s frustrating and i feel like i m socially limiting myself has anyone experienced something similar or any advice on how to get over this,social_anxiety
1p5dd6w,when to apologize i feel like because i have social anxiety i never know when i actually need to apologize and when i am overdoing it i have a fairly new friend who twice now post hangout i have texted them and apologized for something that felt to me like a huge misstep but then got a long paragraph back essentially saying nope that didn t bother me you are all good i want to take accountability and make things right when i feel like i ve hurt someone s feelings but because of my social anxiety i m not a good judge of when that is necessary and i don t want to get into a pattern of consistently putting them into a position where they have to reassure me i ve been thinking of telling them something like i ve realized i have now reached out to you post hangout twice and apologized for something i ve said both times you responded with reassurance and that is super sweet and helpful but not my intention when i apologize i want to make sure that i m not unintentionally hurting you when we spend time together because i really value our relationship i also want to make sure that you know if you are comfortable you are absolutely free to tell me if something i do or say makes you upset i understand that me texting you after we hangout may get annoying and i was wondering if it would be better if i just waited for you to let me know if i ve done something wrong rather than constantly trying to apologize proactively and putting you in a position where you have to reassure me i know that this also reeks of social anxiety but i am really struggling with balancing taking accountability and not apologizing every time i spend time with someone does anyone else feel this does anyone have any tips that help them discern when they actually did something wrong and when they are just overthinking any advice would be greatly appreciated,social_anxiety

1p5ab49,thoughts: if i were to invent smartglasses that give live reassurance during conversations would that actually help my last post about what helped most with your social anxiety had a lot of the top comments mentioning about exposure therapy micro wins and giving yourselves permission to take time when talking it made me wonder if i were to invent smartglasses that quietly give live reminders during conversations things like: it s okay to pause you re not being judged nobody is watching you as closely as you think take a breath you don t have to perform a simple answer is enough you can take your time and maybe even tiny optional prompts like: ask a follow up question you can end the convo politely now look at their eyebrows instead of their eyes if eye contact feels too much or even directly remind us what to say if we provide it with some context beforehand so we don t freeze and potentially other features such as post conversation encouragement tracking the progress exposure therapy analyze the body language of others heartrate tracking do you think that would actually help or would it make you more anxious knowing you re relying on something,social_anxiety
1p5a9j7,scared to engage in the mainstream i dont have social media i know vaguely of the trends right now i dont really know that much other than roughly what people of my age are interested in like basically everyone else here ive felt deeply outcast because of that and factoring in just how long its been im scared to engage in the mainstream media whats popular all it does is remind me how disconnected i feel from everyone else around me young or old the sense of alienation after seeing such things makes my chest hurt which is hard to call a sense because at a point i think you do just become alien i purposely avoid it now i dont want to be reminded of how much ive failed if i even catch wind of one specific new thing or the plot of a new movie ill feel awfully ashamed anyway i hope theres someone out there who reads this and understands this feeling and feels less weird about it and last thing in ten years time deep in your soul will the alienation ever leave is it really threaded into the fabric of your soul the way it feels like it is one day i hope we will all be freed,social_anxiety

1p56wr1,learning to overcome social anxiety feeling behind and losing my personality i know people commonly talk about this on this sub but i m pretty sure my social anxiety is contributing to me feeling behind in life i just got off a call with my high school friends we were catching up and talking about their time at college a lot of them frequently go out have close friends to hang out with get into relationships and overall have no problems forming connections with new people i on the other hand am an introvert who usually spends weekends inside and struggles to form solid relationships with the people around me i don t necessarily have a huge problem with being introverted but it would be nice to have people to do fun things with on the weekends however it s very hard for me to get close to people because i m an overthinker and maybe a little too self aware whenever i try to connect with others like by talking about my interests or hobbies i feel like i m met with blank stares or far less enthusiasm than i show them it makes me feel like they re not truly interested in getting to know me it doesn t help that in college people tend to see me only as a career driven academic and nothing beyond that i also don t really fit into any of the groups i m part of this has caused me to change myself so much to appease whoever i m talking to that i ve started to lose my personality and sense of who i am i feel like i have to act like a character to avoid being perceived as weird or boring because of this i ve stopped reaching out to people platonically or romantically out of fear and i ve continued to isolate myself i ve started to peel away from these feelings a bit this semester but after that call some of them resurfaced and i ve been feeling a little lost again it s been really hard working through these emotions and even though comparison has set me back a little i still feel like i can continue moving forward i recently attended a session through one of my campus organizations that talked about feeling lost or losing your personality as being an opportunity to redefine who you want to be it was one of the most inspirational things i ve heard and it motivated me to keep moving forward instead of getting stuck in anxiety i ve made a promise to myself for the rest of this year and next year to be bold about my interests to stop overthinking every little interaction and to reach out to the people i genuinely want to connect with i m reminding myself that i m my own person and my life doesn t need to compare to anyone else s even though it s easier said than done i m going to keep striving toward that goal i just wanted to share my journey with all of you : tl dr : i ve been struggling with social anxiety and feeling behind compared to my friends who easily form connections i often feel misunderstood isolated and pressured to change myself to fit in which has made me lose touch with who i am but after attending an inspirational campus session i m working on being more authentic reaching out to others and redefining myself without comparing my life to anyone else s i m still learning but i m committed to moving forward,social_anxiety

1p54xrg,stuttering is slowly turning me into someone i don t recognize i ve been dealing with stuttering for years and i can feel it slowly reshaping parts of me i never wanted to lose there are moments when i m completely fluent when i m alone talking to younger people or late at night and in those moments it feels like nothing is wrong with me at all but the second i m around people my age or anyone i want to sound normal with everything inside me freezes my chest tightens my heart starts racing my breath gets stuck and even simple words feel impossible to push out what hurts is that this doesn t reflect who i am i m not quiet withdrawn or afraid of people i actually enjoy talking and connecting but the stuttering keeps dragging me into a version of myself that feels smaller and more distant every day it s exhausting trying to act okay on the outside while fighting my own body just to say basic things i just needed to put this somewhere people might understand what this feels like,social_anxiety

1p51vvu,i feel myself slipping i dont want to be an island i am an intelligent person i am succeding in college and i know i am introspective and caring and also a complete derp sometimes i am often in the clouds and my anxiety makes me freeze up and not be able to respond convey what i wish i could what i feel in my heart how i want to affect people around me positively i have a moment where i feel overwhelmed or simply drifting for a moment and i see people notice and their eyes narrow or a look of knowing flashes in their eyes and i know that the hole inside of me is visible i am not interacting the way i am socially expected to in that moment then that moment of not being present turns into complete withdrawal my body is ridden with fear and frozen and i cannot think or speak my fear makes me come off as apathetic but i do care deeply peering through the windows of my mind i have a couple friends see who i am beyond my anxiety but i feel like i fail them because they want to connect with me and im so scared of letting everyone down that i come off as disingenuous and for the rest what i am capable of becomes lost as the moment for connection passes by me and some assume i am inept i dont want to be treated as if im different but i am i wish i could respond quickly or catch that social cue i wish i could hold my head high and know who i am despite judgement i sense people s pity for me for missing out on the opportunities to connect ive been slipping and im so scared ill always feel this way my condition is not a burden i can expect others to understand or give energy to i feel so alone and defeated i am not slow i am just terrified i have drifted away from my own compass i dont know if i should keep trying even though its traumatizing or isolate from everyone,social_anxiety
1p51mb9,i m really going to try i m scarred but i m going to try because i feel like it s the only way to get over this anxiety not that long ago i posted about being scared to walk in my old job because of how i left it so i was worried on how i d be perceived coming back but i just feel ready like i got off the phone with one of the managers there and again apologized and totally understood when she brought up reliability but i do feel better about speaking up for my mental health needs if i need less hours time to myself but i do have a confirmed job at least for the season but it does sound like they need the help at the store at the end too but i m not going to let that be the end all if for any reason they can t keep me on board and like i was just chit chatting away with her so it felt so natural and not like myself but i mean that in the best way possible i have ideas on what i can say to them i can show them the horse i bonded with over the summer tell them my stories of going to california and i m going to try to be myself even if it makes me feel weird sometimes because people do like me and i have a good personality that i can make friends and be around plus we re looking at adopting a dog of which i will be the main caretaker for and that gives me just a hurst burst of motivation to want to move my life forward to make sure i can continue to keep taking care of a lil baby i just wanted to share since i don t have a lot of people to share to and this community is one that understands each other so a win is good and i hope you guys find this energy too i believe it can happen it all of us i wouldn t have thought this too long ago now so yeah :3,social_anxiety

1p4nf2c,from social anxiety to extrovert in record time hi everyone i m21 found a way to use exposure in the most efficient way for myself i m not a therapist nor do i know exactly how exposure therapy is supposed to work but for comparison: i know someone who does exposure therapy with a therapist while i m doing it on my own the difference in our progress is so huge that it almost feels inhuman while he is still struggling to talk to people i m already able to do the opposite and talk freely to people i know and don t know my method might be a solution though of course it might not be for everyone background: just so you can imagine how far i ve come: i grew up with social anxiety since kindergarten or even before later i was diagnosed with dependency issues depression and social anxiety i went from being scared that someone might stare at me while i was outside to talking to people in groups with confidence this also helped my depression a lot because the social anxiety or rather the low self worth was one of the triggers i feel way better now as if i don t have depression anymore i m still grinding but the progress is real and i ve received a lot of positive feedback it might seem inhuman but it is possible i m not trying to brag i want to spread hope that it is possible this isn t small progress it s huge i know how it feels to live in fear and that s why i want to help others feel more free and less trapped disclaimer: this process requires discipline bravery consistency and the ability to look into yourself honestly that s all you need you don t have to start with high self esteem you can start from very low the more you push through the more progress you will feel day by day or week by week note: it s a process write down every success at the end of the day or share it with someone you trust it really helps in the beginning it doesn t matter how small the success is recording it gives you the power of feeling one step closer to independence the high art of self regulation exposure alone is not enough you must constantly regulate yourself while feeling the fear i repeat: you have to regulate yourself constantly while feeling the fear otherwise exposure won t reach its full potential how to do it whenever you enter any social situation going outside shopping talking to someone you know or don t know you should regulate yourself using certain sentences you can adjust them they aren t golden rules i created them to stabilize myself when i feel fear important: whenever you feel avoidance do the opposite and use the sentences avoiding only makes it worse no matter how small or big the avoidance is do the opposite that s the best way to build self esteem you don t just read them you must feel them writing them down helps a lot when i think of them they relax me the fear the sweating the worries you can say them out loud or read them in your mind if it doesn t work take out your phone and read them slowly and carefully to strengthen your self worth motivational sentences describing your characteristics for me for example: i radiate positivity with my natural way my smile and my presence nothing can stop me so i stay exactly as i am general sentences when i realize it s okay to be who i am all the sadness disappears no fear of talking actively talk self worth is built actively not passively don t wait for reactions take action yourself less analyzing because the need for control is the root of insecurity in large groups i need to switch it off or reduce it stay myself without pretending that way i don t lose energy i gain it when i stay myself i feel no fear don t overinterpret things like silence or blank stares they can have other reasons and are not about me and definitely not tied to my self worth if someone is truly unfriendly it says more about them than about me it does not define my self worth if someone seems harsh but doesn t mean it i should question whether it s actually directed at me focus more on my body sensations and less on the environment that reduces fear and increases confidence don t wait or hope for attention even when i m alone don t think about how it comes across that s just overanalysis redirect thoughts and remind myself that i don t depend on attention my self worth comes from within redirect thoughts when i wonder how something might have come across so overthinking doesn t take over neither from me nor toward me my self worth is independent of other people s reactions don t imagine or simulate future social situations stay in the here and now to avoid triggering fears if the other person doesn t laugh or smile it doesn t reduce my self worth there could be many reasons it says more about them than about me the insecurity about whether something came across weird or whether it s quiet because of me or insecurity when alone or around people all of that is only a projection of my own fear it s not real it s an illusion even when i feel watched or judged it s just a projection of how insecure i feel about how i m being seen i can act or speak naturally i m allowed to be myself these feelings of judgment are only projections every kind of social fear happens only in the mind it s all a projection when i say this to myself and apply these tips the fear goes away when the body tenses up relax it and do a projection check when i feel avoidance consciously do the opposite don t question what i said or wrote afterward leave it as it is keep my self worth anchored within me short version for quick boosts 1 every form of social anxiety and worry is only a projection and therefore not real when i expose it the fear disappears 2 stay in the here and now no ruminating or anticipating 3 be myself self worth comes from within not from outside 4 no reaction from others whether active or passive affects my self worth it says something about them not about me most used sentences i tell myself: this is just a projection or i m projecting again then the fear becomes so small i barely feel it or it disappears completely this should reduce physical symptoms if you feel the meaning behind it every social fear you feel is only a projection everything you fear is what you think not what is real take a short deep breath focus visually on one point and say: this is just a projection the fear in my body is only an illusion created by the brain if someone is unfriendly if someone is truly unfriendly it says more about them than about me and it definitely does not define my self worth when feeling low use motivational sentences about your characteristics: individual characteristics as being positive and so on just like above and when i realize it s okay to be who i am all the sadness disappears the purpose is to strengthen your inner core and not rely on external validation start with the long version and gradually switch to the short version as it gets easier if you have a relapse just use the instructions it will get better eventually you can feel self esteem without needing the sentences at all i m slowly moving toward that step but i still need to consolidate this new safer state i just realized that making myself small or feeling a need for attention for example downplaying myself is also an indicator of a projection of low self worth so when you feel needy or want to be noticed redirect your thoughts to your own self worth and tell yourself that it s just a projection that you don t actually need to be seen because self worth comes from within it s better to use the sentences with your individual characteristics and remind yourself that you re not dependent on attention from others it s possible to feel drained after a full exposure session that s why i still recommend taking time for yourself for example i watch funny videos that lift my mood after exposure and i feel better than ever this serves as a kind of cooldown or reward note: before posting this someone gave me a downvote here in anxiety i felt bad at first then i told myself this is just a projection it says more about the person who downvoted me and doesn t affect my self worth it would be easier to explain this in person but i ll gladly answer as much as i can i wrote this quickly so it s long but hopefully helpful if you re interested i can improve it even further just let me know in the comments i am from germany btw,social_anxiety

1p4isky,making friends is so hard i ve been at college for almost 4 months now and it s feels impossible to make an actual friend i have a bunch of people i m acquaintances with but it only really extends to small talk whenever we happen to run into each other i do appreciate them but it s hard to not feel lonely when all ur connections are just surface level i m fine with being alone occasionally but i crave friendship ali want is just a friend who i can text and hang out with it s really demotivating cuz i feel like i ve been putting in so much effort in trying to get closer to ppl but none of them seem to want to reciprocate whats even worse is that i feel like it s my fault that they don t because whenever i did end up hanging out or eating with someone i would just be so awkward and quiet that i feel like i m just boring them and wasting their time which ends up pushing them away they end up gravitating away from me and towards people they actually do want to be around i never get invited to plans i get left on delivered seen all the time and all my friends just seem to have closer friends they consider to be their actual friends idk what to do because i feel like i ve been doing all the right things to make friends joining clubs talking to ppl in my classes reaching out to ppl and js taking any opportunity i can to meet ppl but all i can get are just a bunch of acquaintances who don t seem to want to put in the effort into building a stronger relationship with me after they get to know me it s hard cuz sa completely erases my personality so people think i m boring but i need to be closer to people in order for me to be more comfortable being myself it s getting to a point where i feel like i m genuinely just not a likeable person has anyone else been in this type of situation,social_anxiety

1p49htb,realising i was actually an extrovert with social anxiety helped me a lot interestingly enough i figured it out through a song: from your room by mia stegner she mentions using an introvert identity but feeling miserable when she s alone a lot i was like wow that s me and i thought more and i realised that the only times i don t like being around people is when my anxiety and overthinking kicks in once i addressed this i ve learned to approach social situations better i ask someone close to me to come i pay attention to my feelings and needs i advocate for myself more in social settings i also suffer from panic disorder which could be triggered by nothing or by anxiety i ve found my mental health seriously improving by doing all this sometimes i can only stick around for half an hour because of anxiety but even that s enough to make me feel happy i got to spend time with friends i also realised my anxiety when talking to new people is a lot less than when i m in that in between of acquaintance and friendship that damn friendship imposter syndrome lmao funny how it works,social_anxiety
1p48rp7,does it actually help to face uncomfortable situations or your fears when you have social anxiety hey just a quick note before i start: my english isn t great so i m using a bit of google translate i hope everything still makes sense i wanted to share something that happened to me recently i ve had diagnosed social anxiety for about five years it s been better at times and worse at times but lately it s been really bad i ve been unemployed for a while i feel extremely uncomfortable in my own body and i ve honestly developed a kind of hatred toward people i spend most of my time in my room one of my more functioning friends thought it would be good for us to go out and do something somehow we ended up buying tickets to a datenight party mostly as a joke i wasn t planning on meeting anyone she was more motivated and i had never been to a club before i m in my early 20s and she s 20 i thought what s the worst that could happen we also agreed that if one of us found someone they liked the other one could stay or leave and no one would be upset just so nobody ends up feeling like the third wheel when we arrived we immediately realized the age range was completely different from what was advertised it was supposed to be 18 30 but there were lots of people in their 30s 40s and older we were definitely the youngest ones there that already made me really tense once we were inside i hated everything the music the people the atmosphere it was like a completely different world to me and then within the first five minutes my friend left me alone to go after the first guy she saw so i sat in a corner for like 20 minutes feeling like an alien in a movie the noise the lights the people i felt disgusting and totally out of place i knew she wasn t going to come back so i searched the whole club until i found her in some hidden room cuddling with a guy she had just met i told her i was leaving she didn t understand at first but eventually she followed me outside i explained how awful the whole situation felt and how she basically abandoned me she said she told me she might take longer but what does that even mean was she coming back was she not she didn t think about it at all we went home after that i m in therapy and i keep being told that it s important to face your fears and put yourself into uncomfortable situations but for me it feels like the opposite it doesn t help it just makes things worse it s a huge stress factor i avoid people as much as possible but forcing myself into situations like this doesn t make anything better either i ve been trying this approach for years and it honestly feels counterproductive,social_anxiety
1p47upf,it feels like it s too late for me i m going to be 28 in february have pretty much wasted the last ten fucking years of my life even when i was in therapy and even an inpatient program i made very little progress with anything and now it feels like i ve completely given up on ever getting better i feel paralyzed and can t do anything to get rid of my social anxiety and the trauma that caused it i really don t see any way out other than suicide how am i supposed to get better when i don t have he willpower to do anything how am i supposed to do exposure therapy when i m too scared to even do the smallest bit of exposure i hit a wall every time and am too scared to continue i just feel fundamentally broken and a lost cause,social_anxiety
1p47s0e,the main theme of my anxiety is the feeling that everyone hates me now obviously that s not literal but growing up i have been teased scoffed at disregarded harshly critized roasted for my appearance and features i cannot feasibly change shamed for my quiet personality but also shamed for trying to be social no matter where i am i always have felt this feeling my entire life even me being unattractive and super little affecting my anxiety takes second place to this feeling i understand that in society people all go through their own crap and it may make them miserable but it doesn t help that it seems like lots of people in public are unempathetic and careless and spite filled i m just not made out to be around other people i feel as though i m just this one big burden even when i try to stay out of the way and keep calm kind and respectful,social_anxiety

1p3yeo8,the fear of personal personality related questions is what gets me most i ve had social anxiety for a long time and recently it s been better overall but there s one main thing that makes it so that i can never advance past a certain point the fear that if i get even slightly closer to someone they will ask something more personal and just can t deal with that i just have this fear of being judged so i hate sharing anything personal about myself favorite movie genres favorite good favorite games hobbies etc and this is one reason why i avoid conversations as i really don t want to be asked any of this this is why i feel slightly more comfortable when i talk to someone that i know won t ask me anything like that i m mostly more comfortable on reddit but this fear is so deep that i d barely feel comfortable sharing any of that even here,social_anxiety
1p3xhm3,i went on another date and it surprisingly went so well today i tried going on another date at first i was so skeptical nervous and really scared because the date location was a bit unfamiliar to me it was like really unfamiliar which scared me more i had to apologize to the driver so many times fortunately i reached the destination he was there waiting already i thought to myself screw it i m just going to be myself this time who cares if i nervous laugh and stuff that thought helped me soooo much we talked so many things giggle and surprisingly he was a talker and as a listener that was such a good thing for me the location was really cozy not much people around which probably helped me feel at ease we talked a lot about experiences preferences and stuff unlike the first guy i went on a date with his questions were so subtle i didn t even notice them not so invasive but you could still get to know the person after we ate we went for a walk which was really nice spent a bit of a time at a lobby and talked more i giggled so much not because of being nervous but i was genuinely enjoying the time then we went to his place surprisingly he was so repsectful and nothing more happened than talked giggle a bit of cuddles per se he s huggable and i really liked that a lot we talked more we both enjoy the same interest which has helped me a lot he booked a cab for me and i got home safely we both then agreed that we can freely explore more dates i am really glad for tonight for a good company and also for being brave to actually put myself out there overcoming my fear of meeting people,social_anxiety
1p3x0lb,i ve realized that my lack of confidence is what s holding me back in my life how do i improve it so yesterday i was feeling kinda crappy and i was just trying to sleep i was thinking about a lot of the problems i have with myself and i realized that they almost all stem from my lack of confidence i was going to write two different posts one about how most people don t treat me as an equal them or as if i m a kid and another post about how it hurts that i ve never dated anyone or have been asked out by anyone i tried to think of reasons of why this could be an example being because i m a very short male 5 1 despite being 18 but then how come my friend who s just barely taller has a girlfriend i thought about it and he seems to be much more confident i thought maybe it s because i don t look attractive but then how come other people who aren t very attractive are in relationships because they are confident my confidence used to be much much worse years ago but it s gotten a little better as i accepted the fact that i m super short and i ve also started going to the gym for about two months now these do help but i m still not a very confident person i ve been described as a passive person who doesn t stand up for himself so that should give you an idea of my personality a bit anyways now that i ve made this realization what should i do to improve my confidence,social_anxiety

1p3lxzi,can you be an extrovert with social anxiety hello i am a 23 year old female and i am wondering if it s possible to be an extrovert and have social anxiety for some context i love being social i have no problem talking to strangers in public while waiting in lines and i am very quick to make friends with strangers i follow a logic that i will probably never run into these people again and i have no connection to them thus their opinions on me do not matter it makes it easy to just be me and i typically always leave those types of conversations feeling very positive what i struggle with is the people closest to me i often have a fear that i ve done something to upset others when i am in a group setting with my close friends i often replay conversations and think back on my interactions to dissect what i said how i acted how the other person reacted etc dud to these fears that i have done something wrong i often bring up to someone how i m feeling and if they think i should apologize or if i am reading too far into things i am starting to realize that this tends to backfire a lot what to me seems as me just asking a friend for advice on if i have done something to upset a friend in which case i will always take accountability and apologize or if i am being delusional as i know i can overthink things or not understand tone jokes i m wondering if anyone else feels this way and what strategies they use when these fears arise is there a strategy i can use to help me decipher if someone is truly upset or doesn t like me i struggle to tell in situations where it s like my friends friend who is in the group but i m not close with likes me or is just kinda in a position where we have to be around each other any advice would be greatly appreciated i really wanna work on not letting these feelings of fear and the crushing of no one likes me i said something stupid now their whole opinion on me is changed and i can t go back because a part of me knows it s not rational i just don t know how to stop it thank you,social_anxiety
1p3jij1,accepting myself to help ease sa i ve been thinking lately the more i know what i value the more i will feel convicted in what role i will play then i can accept myself and what really matters to me instead of always feeling like i have to brace and hyper adapt to the expectations of people i m around i ve been thinking i want to learn to be a better friend to people to go about my daily life feeling invested in those around me not overly so not controlling but just enough to set myself up for the rejections that occur when i am true to my values but i won t just be setting myself up for rejection i will be setting myself up for genuine bonding too tonight i read the carl jung quote loneliness does not come from having no people about one but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible maybe if i give more attention towards figuring out what really matters to me then my loneliness will decrease i won t be as afraid around people because i will know who i am and am not and i will have areas of common ground to bond with people through i d love to hear your story if you ve found accepting yourself has helped with social anxiety and the accompanying feelings of loneliness or alienation,social_anxiety
1p3ivp9,going into my old job for the first time in a few months most likely going to get my job back i ve been avoiding going into my last job since i left dealing with mental health issues and kinda ghosted without saying anything but my mom has been trying to get me to go into the mall so we could see if anything has changed if a new store we ve been waiting to open has updated more and i ve been pushing back every time but something today deep down told me it would be okay i ended up getting some coupons in the mail for it and decided that would be my excuse for going in i walk in and see two of my old coworkers and i m kinda scared but i joke around and say hey stranger to them and they re both excited to see me then as i m shopping around the store manager was there and she was on the phone but very excited to see me and as i was checking out i made a comment saying if they needed holiday help i d be down to put in an application since i haven t had a job in months and she said so sincerely that she understands and would love to have me back on so i m excited really and i hope my new confidence i got through my residential stay will actually shine through this time over maybe i can make things be normal a little more again,social_anxiety
1p3itxf,i find people boring and feel guilty for that hi guys i wasn t sure where to post this to get an opinion so i figured social anxiety would be a good place since i struggle with it too i used to think i was just a shy person and throughout my life i ve been working on improving my social skills i always believed that the reason i had trouble making friends was simply because i was shy but now that i m getting better at socializing and even making friends more easily i ve realized that shyness wasn t the only issue i find it really hard to be genuinely interested in other people and i feel bad about that sometimes i keep friendships and hang out with people because i don t want to feel like a bad friend especially when the other person clearly likes me even though the whole time i m secretly wanting to go home it s much easier for me to enjoy spending time with people in work or college settings where there are tasks or activities to focus on my interactions there feel fun maybe because they re quick and structured but when it comes to going out just for fun i usually don t have fun at all unless i drink but i m not really a drinking person deep inside i wish i cared i crave for having a genuine friendship caved on interest not guilt but don t know how just venting to see if anyone relates or has any thoughts and sorry for the english it s not my first language,social_anxiety

1p3flg1,how the heck do so many people with sa end up traveling solo i ve seen so many cases here and elsewhere of people traveling solo and it s one of the only things regarding social anxiety that actually breaks my brain i ve been planning a trip for months prepared a lot for it read endless anecdotes from sa sufferers and already booked but i am so close to cancelling it i just can t internalize how people successfully do that and even end up saying they loved it i understand there s levels to social anxiety and maybe those with a lesser not trying to diminish anxiety just can t think of a better word form of sa are able to push through perhaps medication helps with that i currently take no medication for my anxiety for what it s worth for me stepping out of the house is a challenge being in public spaces with people would raise my self consciousness to an insane degree and the thought of talking to anyone or adulting alone in a foreign country sounds like an absolutely herculean obstacle it s just demoralizing to me that i am hyper ventilating so much i am feeling nauseous so much i am sleepless and i am just straight up terrified to commit to something i want to do and i know might make me grow and face my fears but the fear is too high i ve had sa since i was bullied as a kid around age 6 i am now 34 and i think this is the most anxious i have ever felt anyone in a similar boat can you travel alone or have you,social_anxiety

1p39oxe,is anyone else obsessed with internet stalking im new to this sub so im not sure if this is the right place for this but i was just wondering do other social anxious people do this to feel better about interactions or to determine whether they should talk to someone or not i primarily do this for random guys i like in my class or guys who come into my work i look up their first last name on any social media and most of the time something always comes up and look through friends lists etc to see if they are someone id want to potentially talk to i know it s weird but its not like im looking up addresses its kind of just to access whether or not they have gfs or not and if we might have anything in common to bring up if i were to ever talk to them no matter what i find though i can never bring myself to say anything irl and it s becoming a problem to where id rather just obsessively look at their social media instead of interaction in person i often think about messaging them online but that would be absolutely weird as we have never interacted i know you cant form any kind of meaningful connection romantic platonic etc through being a weirdo on the internet but i genuinely don t know how to be normal and socialize,social_anxiety
1p38cbn,trying to understand why i sometimes anger people so i ve been making some people angry for no apparent reason and i m actually clueless i ll provide some context i m a 36 year old guy i live in the netherlands and have been diagnosed with add last year i ve got a pending result for asd with a high probability most people describe me as a silent but chill guy who is not that outgoing i live by live and let live since i ve been diagnosed with add and have been taking prescribed medications ssris and amphetamines i feel a whole bunch better it does not fix everything but it makes it more bearable i m finally able to sort things out and get an understanding about who i am what i do and why i do but there s one thing that keeps slipping my mind and it s driving me nuts i ve had some people get mad at me seemingly for no apparent reason it happens to be mostly men between the age of 20 to 60 about 95 the other 5 is women between the age of 45 60 the frequency is about 5 to 6 times a year as an example i m just sitting somewhere and they snap all of sudden there s a whole bunch of variety in what action reactions i get sometimes they do a little extra effort and come to me if they aren t in range the simplest are dirty looks i can t really describe and mean regards about my physical appearance in the worst case they get physical it happens at social gatherings work and basically everywhere people are involved i ve had complete strangers be hostile from the moment they lay eyes on me not a single word spoken or looks exchanged one thing that occurs a whole bunch more is that people from above mentioned sex and age range try to prevent eye contact like at the register in some store a little grab out of the box of things these people have told me: i m vain i m provocative as in i m actively challenging them i m not that good looking i m a showoff in context of the things i ve been called i can say i m not actively trying to be any of those things basic hygiene is important but i don t really care about how i look i really do not care about dick measuring i never said i m good looking i m just having fun i m not racing you i m racing myself i ve been looking over everything and analyzing things but i m actually stumped tried talking to a therapist but no answer i ve tried talking to people about it but no one seems to believe me tried talking to someone that had been mean to me on work hr got involved afterwards we got to know each other better and are chill now and i thought i could ask the man why he got so angry then he just said i looked mean i could sense he was not being sincere with me so i m kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place any ideas many thanks in advance edit: talked to some more people and apparently i give of vibes that i m not a typical guy guy and can be perceived as misandristic when there s actual contact it s mainly because i don t participate in the degrading insulting humor who knew that not fitting in and not actively trying to be an asshole is considered rude,social_anxiety

1p31fuf,the day my grandmother passed away hello my grandmother passed away the day before yesterday and the news was a shock and completely unexpected for me so i prepared myself and took two inderal pills because i knew the day would be hard and long at the beginning i didn t know how to act what to say how to express my sadness how to console others how to talk i felt like a child who has no idea what to do i felt like everyone was looking at me and judging me so i got extremely anxious and that anxiety completely overshadowed my sadness about her death that was shocking to me of course most of my relatives came along with their friends that s when i realized i don t really have any friends to comfort me no one i know was there for me the first day passed and it was heavy on the second and third day i was expected to sit and receive people like i m the man of the family representing everyone but i don t know anyone some people talked to me with annoyance: you don t remember me i tell you who i am every time and you forget i never know what to say someone responded on my behalf telling them he s not into social stuff that s just how he is and i felt embarrassed and guilty like i m being accused of not knowing anyone or anything a lot of people ignored me on purpose as if i m a little kid who doesn t know anything even though i m 22 honestly when i compare myself to my colleagues i feel like if the same thing happened to them they would ve handled it better than i did i m genuinely exhausted drained very anxious and sadly the last thing i m feeling right now unfortunately is grief for my grandmother,social_anxiety

1p305ii,how to reduce the impact of anxiety on the body i m in my 20s graduated from college this year unemployed staying home and having no friends which is fine with me the problem is i have trouble interacting with other people for long periods of time as soon as i feel unsure of my words or actions i blush 99 of the time my hands start shaking i automatically look away i can blush if i make eye contact with someone even my family my head goes blank and so on i can force myself to ask a passerby something buy groceries or make a phone call it s great that they can t see my shaking hands these are all short interactions and i don t have time to get too scared but things like interviews presentations and long conversations all of that is difficult my mind knows that none of this is fatal but my body just doesn t listen and takes on a life of its own the main thing that bothers me is that i periodically get chest pains from anxiety probably due to my increased heart rate and adrenaline this doesn t happen during stress but after the situation is over the pain comes in bursts with a burning and stabbing sensation and this can last for several days the longest i ve ever experienced was four days at these moments i feel like i ll die of cardiac arrest faster than my social phobia goes away this is probably the main reason why i avoid leaving my comfort zone but unfortunately it doesn t make the problem go away has anyone else experienced this and can offer advice p s sorry for mistakes i wrote the text with a translator,social_anxiety

1p2z4rg,i overthink when talking to people my sister and boyfriend have noticed that sometimes when i am discussing with them about something i tend to say it in a straight forward approach or even an insensitive approach that i can come off as aggressive or even rude however with them this issue has been dealt with as i try to be more careful with how i speak and when something comes off the wrong way we just discuss it and i explain to them with what i meant however i have noticed that i have an issue of making friends or maybe not making friends but having long lasting friendships i don t have any best friends nor even close friends the close friends i have made unfortunately are either online friends that i have met while gaming and that s it i recently had made a good friend who i would have called a best friend but certain values of hers didn t align with me and i decided to cut ties with her anyway due to this issue with me speaking aggressively or too straight forward i have slowly developed some bad social anxiety where i worry a lot when i speak or after i am done talking to someone i end up worrying a lot if i had said the wrong thing i believe that i am friendly outgoing and think before i speak most of the time but i am unable to make good long lasting friendships and now not only am i bad at having good long lasting friendships but i have some pretty bad anxiety when i speak to people such as colleagues strangers etc any advice that someone can give or can anyone relate thanks,social_anxiety

1p2u34z,how to not look at people when you know they are staring at you i cannot find it anymore but there was a good post on here saying that people who have social anxiety and get anxious from staring are looking for confirmation in each person that that person is staring something like your anxious mind is hyperaware of the probability so you look for the look in order to release anxiety bc you know for sure they are looking and you confirmed it but it s a loop bc you are still anxious about all the staring they said you have to be comfortable with the uncertainty this really resonated with me in just don t know how to implement what are things you think in your head or methods you use to keep yourself from looking for the stare in others i live in a country where everyone looks different from me so yes they are actually staring at me and in the culture they already stare so it s even heavier they stare and often don t break eye contact then they are caught sometimes they even bend their neck to keep staring in general living here and being in this interracial relationship even prior to the move has triggered a lot of social anxiety in me over the years to the point where i don t want to go out sometimes bc i am always under surveillance by others,social_anxiety
1p2tj7k,the cure to your all your worrying is to stop thinking that is not advice but rather more a fact its truths do not lessen the burden of walking the path to see that for yourself all socially anxious agree on this one principle that all our attempts to master the world by means of overthinking about all the minutiae and trifles of life end in failure we do not achieve the world of certainty we demand and we pay at every moment a price far too great for one to bear rendered out of us in constant fear and self loathing though the way is dim there is light as i have found out for myself what prevents our capacity to regulate our minds in just proportion so that it works for us rather than against us why are we seemingly under constant threat of attack from all fronts what pulls so tightly at our hearts and renders us so unworthy of standing equal amongst one another all answers to these questions will bear themselves in the form of a thought by means of a process of reflective self awareness in which we attempt to use the tool of thinking to come to a sound resolution what are to be the fruits of such labor what is gained in thinking except more thoughts it stands to reason that the only outcome worth valuing is that which eventually moves beyond thoughts and into action or nonaction depending on how you do or do not think about it what we desire is peace of mind and resignation from our perpetual battle with being human amongst humans if we contend that our suffering is lessened by cessation of continuous reflective thinking then what binds us to it so strongly herein lies the truth of the matter the struggle by which we persist in folly is rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of our self if we analyze closely our socially anxious self identity we find that it is in large part defined by the judgments of others that is to say we allow ourselves to be in part defined by the myriad of opinions in which others might posses of us opinions which we constantly seek to control or influence so as to reaffirm our own internal sense of self image the result is a self image that is like a castle alone and vulnerable in a hostile world whose large walls are needed to keep others out anyone who can pierce the defenses has a clear line of sight to all the vulnerabilities that lay at our hearts we are destroyed in an instant if the others judgments are met without equal ground to make a stand on thus the judgments of others or even just our beliefs of their judgments comes to form the basis of our new self image in practice we give to others the keys to our self identity and we suffer in its defense being so open to attack and with so much at stake it suffices to say that the socially anxious life is exhausting if this is the great error that we have no firm ground by which to self suffice then what is our solution to give the solution is to do injustice to the path which one must walk in order to see the virtue of such a solution but i have already given it in the cessation of reflective thinking this is harder to do in practice for our minds are built out of beliefs forming complex worldviews stuffed with emotional baggage and misguided by the non values of society we have inherited and not reflected upon not thinking calls into question our entire understanding of morality self others and being itself aristotle tells us that all virtues become vices in excess or deficit reflective thinking is a tool that becomes a crutch when overused it can distort reality just as much as it can make it clear self awareness reveals an infinite hall of mirrors to one who takes it to its limits it reveals a self that the more you try to understand it by thinking about it the more complex it becomes there is no stable ground in self reflection what is left when you stop thinking stable ground lies under your feet,generalized_anxiety

1p2ifwx,public speaking and panic attacks m24 i ve been suffering from panic attacks for about 12 years it might sound absurd but until a year ago i wasn t even able to give them a name i didn t know what was happening to me i only knew they started from inside me and felt like electric shocks at first they were rare and limited to certain situations so i pretended they didn t exist then 5 years ago during my high school finals i had the most terrible attack of my life out of nowhere and for no apparent reason it s a moment i will never forget and that caused me immense embarrassment since then i developed a constant fear of oral exams at university and a significant glossophobia however my desire to continue my university studies which i really enjoy along with being fairly ambitious and driven meant that every time for each exam i just gritted my teeth and suffered for weeks hoping i wouldn t experience that awful moment again i can t deny that the anxiety trembling and heart palpitations often made me perform worse than i deserved sometimes i came very very close to having another attack but i always managed to avoid it now as i write this there are 8 days left until my thesis defense probably the day i fear most since i started university even 9 months ago i would spend my evenings thinking about it before falling asleep so i decided to start psychotherapy it definitely helped in some ways but my fear has only softened a little it s still huge i imagine that terrible scene on repeat at least 100 times a day: me feeling sick in front of all my friends and family the nightmare returning with fifty times the intensity honestly i ve even thought about taking an anxiety medication on the day but i really don t want to since i ve never done it wouldn t know how and it would feel like a point of no return for me but maybe i need it i don t know my therapist says i don t i really don t know what to do or think anymore apart from this burden i carry all in all i ve had a happy and fulfilling life but in 8 days if things go badly i might fall into a black hole that i don t know if i can climb out of just being honest,panic_disorder

1p2hbex,our social anxiety steams from our egoistical self that s making us believe we re constantly being watched and judged but nope the truth is that everyone has that ego within themselves that from childhood made you feel like it s only you having this human experience while everyone around was literally around you and you are the center of the universe frankly enough everyone thinks more of themselves than they do of you even they if they judge you it s to take attention from themselves bottom line i don t know i am still figuring this problem out but one thing for sure is that each one of us is having their own being or call it whatever your like and btw everyone is busy with themselves more than caring about you even if they show so yet it s only in how you relate to how they care about themselves ps: we are creatures that are social so keep this in mind we still need each other and keep in mind that it is what if it went uncheck is what leads to such social anxiety or whatever,social_anxiety
1p2h635,is it an anxious attachment style i have this thing where when i m in a social setting i need to be with someone i know i struggle to socialize in social settings and sometimes it gets really awkward if i m by myself like i really need a friend to latch onto and introduce me to others and even then i m still pretty awkward for example i was at a party recently and i knew some of the people but not enough to have more steady conversation i have one friend who knows everybody and we re friends but not like close friends i was following her around and she usually doesn t say anything or seem to mind it but it s when she starts moving around between social groups that i tend to get lost the other groups are way more difficult to navigate and some of them tend to be very stand offish so part of it is me and part of it is them to be honest it kind of looks like i m a puppy following around their owner and some friends don t mind it but i ve actually lost friends because of it they don t like it or comes off really weird or needy what is this is it an attachment style issue,social_anxiety
1p2gicc,do you make others with your presence uneasy i was just wondering if this happens to you too when i m among people i notice after some time that they get uneasy around me they ll not feel relaxed and they ll even look anxious act awkward they start to miss their words they start to miss their movements meaning they become like very clumsy and stressed around me it s like being in front of your great love for the first time you become uneasy clumsy say dumb things etc but it s like stress or something from them they act like this around me lol boys girls everyone idk why probably because of my sa they take my mood or something but the thing is i m not that anxious around them they just do this without any reason they start to sigh move around a lot fidgeting when sitting at one place you can feel the tension in the air and you know it s because of your aura and the thing is that i m not a rude person i m kind and everything but somehow i just make them act and feel uneasy it may has to do something with my facial expressions bc i always show the people fear on my face and it makes people really uneasy then they start to rub their eyes when they look at me and it s yeah probably my aura bc when i m not around and i look at the group from far away they don t look anxious but when i go among them and greet them they act weird say hi but they doesn t really say anything like they just keep quiet around me,social_anxiety

1p1vpu9,how do you make friends as an adult i m in my mid 20s and work from home so i barely meet people outside of work calls over the years i ve lost many friends because life moved us in different directions i m happy in my relationship we re getting married in two years but i still want a small circle of genuine friends my problem is that i seem to attract two types of people: 1 those who trauma dump on me because they sense i m sensitive empathetic and kind 2 those who think i m an easy person to take advantage of what they don t realize is that i m actually a strong person who knows my boundaries i ve stayed kind without losing my self respect that self respect also builded over the years after several bad experiences i even faced lot of problems when it comes to something simple like splitting bills if someone pays i send my share immediately but when i pay first some people just don t return their part i used to think i was too shy to ask but even when i did they didn t pay back that s become a huge red flag for me i confront it softly and if nothing changes i cut them off because of these experiences making friends as an adult has become really hard even online it s worse i live in bangalore and when i posted on a subreddit looking for friends clearly stating no nsfw i m happily committed and just want to socialize i still received inappropriate messages or assumptions that i m looking for something else i don t care about gender when it comes to friendship but that doesn t mean i m looking for anything beyond friendship i just want genuine people even convincing my partner about how important socialising it is was easier than actually finding the right kind of people right now i honestly don t know how to find my type of friends when something happens repeatedly it means something going wrong it s either i have to change something or i am looking at wrong place after all of these i am just confused any advice is appreciated,social_anxiety

1p1hwc3,my experience with propranolol hello i just want to share my personal experience with propranolol because i feel like it could help someone out i have social anxiety so so bad it has gotten better as i ve gotten older but it s still pretty bad especially when presenting or just talking in a group bigger than like 6 the last presentation i gave was as a group powerpoint i talked for maybe less than one minute i was swaying the whole time my voice was shaky like i was going to cry the presentation i just recently had to give was 15 minutes long and by myself i couldn t sleep the night before and when i would fall asleep i d wake up with a high heart rate well morning of my presentation i woke up and my heart rate was running 130 145 i almost emailed my teacher to tell her i just couldn t do it i decided to go ahead and take 20mg of propranolol and trusted that it would work i took it around 6:45 knowing my presentation was around 8:30 8:45 i calmed down some by around 7:20 it was around 80 or so which is great i got to class at 7:30 and took another 10mg by the time i walked into class i was feeling so calm i know it s not supposed to calm your thoughts but for me it does i think with a calm body my mind is calm as well while other presenters went before me i was still fairly calm with no negative thoughts i was actually sweating profusely though my water bottle could ve slipped out my hand when i went up to present my heart wasn t beating out of chest i wasn t shaking i could stand still and my voice was smooth and steady it was insane and i kept thinking wow this is crazy i still talked a little too fast my mouth was a little dry and my thoughts still weren t all the way there but i had basically my whole presentation and what i wanted to say memorized so i didn t go blank or anything like that which was one of my biggest fears i probably could ve taken another 10mg but since my doc only prescribed 20 i didn t wanna chance anything by adding 20 more so if you needed a sign to try propranolol this is it just do it it can be life changing tldr propranolol gave me the ability to actually get up and present without having a panic attack,social_anxiety

1p13w40,feeling left out in a discord group i m close to because they love voice calls and i don t i don t know if this is a vent or question i suppose the former ever since i was a kid i ve had big issues with feeling left out with friends family coworkers whatever it has always hurt so much and makes me a little irrationally angry if i m being really honest i ve tried finding meaningful ways to get over this but it still happens to me as an adult i enjoy this group a lot and it s a server i made myself for a fandom we re all in there s about 6 8 of us but besides me and one other guy they love doing group calls i truly don t understand the appeal they re not usually even playing games together which is what i thought the purpose of those voice channels was they re just joking and talking i would rather die honestly lol texting is wonderful because there s no pressure to reply right away you can edit anything embarrassing you say you can confront conflict without as much of the awkwardness as you can when you speak etc so almost every day during the night when we used to always chat and joke around they all vanish into the voice channel leaving me to either wait for someone to come back to talk or leave discord when i was hoping we could all hang out there i realize they re not trying to leave me out one who i m closest to once made the others wait to see if i would join another said it was fun and asked if i d like to come they re all really nice truly i just wish they d stop with the calls and go back to instant messaging which is kind of the whole reason i made this server but i also realize obviously it s unfair to expect them to quit their fun just so i can talk to people in the regular channels in the sub we all met on it s gotten considerably smaller in recent months so inviting more people i m comfortable with will be very difficult i m sorry if this sounds like a childish problem it s just bothering me a lot i ve been a little isolated since i moved to another country haven t seen my family in 2 years and while my husband is my best friend in the world and we spend a lot of quality time together as a very shy introvert the internet has always felt like a world where i can finally open up without as much of my social anxiety hindering me so this world gets even smaller for me,social_anxiety
1p13w07,i finally went to therapy and i don t know how to feel going to therapy when you have sa is extremely difficult my worst fear is talking to strangers and figures of authority and therapy is basically that the entire session felt like exposure therapy tbh i was so nervous that i couldn t even answer the questions with full honesty i felt like my brain was just coming up with random answers to get through the interrogation as soon as possible i felt extremely bad for not being able to be myself i couldn t really open up and didn t even want to during the entire session i felt like i shouldn t have come and that i should have solved my problems on my own instead of turning them into something to go to therapy for i don t even know what to expect i can t even believe in a cure and it felt so bad being vulnerable to a stranger anyway i also suspect that i have bpd but i can t open up about it for the life of me i feel extremely embarrassed about that one i don t even know how to bring it up because of how complicated it has become i kinda regret doing therapy sa is a problem but at the end of the day i don t really want to become social i m an introvert and even if my anxiety went away i wouldn t want to socialise that much and the main problem i have with therapy is that i am supposed to talk and talking for me in social settings is a nightmare so how am i hoping to benefit from therapy i practically forget what i want to say when i m nervous my voice starts shaking and i lose track of my chain of thoughts and start talking gibberish it s really bad and deep down i know therapy is not gonna do it for me,social_anxiety

1p1176j,as a teenager socializing is my biggest fear i m a junior in high school and i don t really have many friends i talk to people here and there but most times it s cause i don t want to ignore them as they speak to me i ve been ignored so many times whenever i try to bring up a point that i can t bring myself to do it to someone else it feels terrible anyways i have two friends i sit with during lunch and they re the only people i can talk to even though it s just awkward sometimes i ll try and start a conversation and say how s your day and they ll say it s good what about you and i ll respond and it ll end i mean pure silence for an hour i m scared of speaking to people but this year i ve gotten a little better cause phones were sometimes people start conversations with me and ask me about things i don t want to talk about like my grades sure my grades are all a s but usually people who ask me about my grades tend to have higher grades than me in ap courses which i do not take so for the most part it feels like i m being judged sometimes i care so much that a comment made on something that it replays in my head the entire day sometimes ever longer and the worst part of it all: speaking in front of people i don t know why but anytime my name is called to answer a question everything i know just disappears and i say the wrong answer then proceed to beat myself up over it calling myself stupid this is definitely overreaction cause nobody cares i don t really care that much but i don t get it why is it that i still fear i have no romantic relationships whatsoever and in one of my classes it s all i hear about i keep getting asked about how it s going with that one girl that they one of my classmates happened to see me sitting with but she s a friend with some common interests and i don t talk to her much i just don t like it when people turn their whole life into their relationship and make it so that everyone knows how it s going it s probably just a me thing this year has been way better than it was sophomore year i had no friends at all and i d go home without uttering a single sound this year is kind of different but i can t help but just feel frightened when i have to start a conversation with someone that i don t know if you ve read this much thank you for reading this feel free to leave a comment,social_anxiety
1p113ge,fear of rejection my whole life i ve wanted to be part of something to be accepted to be wanted to be someone yet i am a coward always been it was the first day of sixth grade i had just moved to a new neighborhood and on top of that i was starting middle school in an unfamiliar place where i didn t know anyone i was also feeling this peculiar new emotion of intense self consciousness that paralyzed me in fear and kept my lips shut tight preventing me from making any new friends i had always been a shy kid who took time to warm up to people but this was a new level of social aversion perhaps brought about by my entry into preteenagehood i minded my business all day not saying a word to anyone and at last i found myself sitting alone on the bus ride home looking out the window with a forlorn expression on my face hi sweetie are you sad an eighth grade girl had taken pity on me and was attempting to cheer me up i said nothing i know i look scary i promise i won t bite i m not scary right she looked toward her friend for support i continued to give her nothing until she eventually shrugged her shoulders and went back to her seat this is a pattern that would continue for the rest of my life i desperately wish to be accepted to have friends to be seen i spend every waking moment agonizing in pain that this is not the reality yet every chance i get every opportunity that is presented to me to be seen to make a friend to be part of the group i reject it i reject it ignoring everyone around me and actively holding myself down denying any and all attempts from other persons to get to know me i squirm in place head down waiting for their attention to fall off me all the while i m dying inside i m screaming at myself not to do this again my thoughts are racing with the persistent idea that everyone hates me everyone is disgusted by me why am i like this i reject people before they can reject me i deny myself the opportunity before i can make a fool of myself before i can say something stupid before they have the chance to see me for the loser i really am so i reject them first i don t let them in i d rather wallow in my self pity than take the risk of rendering myself vulnerable to their rejection,social_anxiety
1p106d7,should i work towards popularity or being okay not being popular my social anxiety occurs more than what i think is healthy and i 17f believe it comes from my insecurities i ve grown over the years being that having no best friend no huge group of friends i only go out with my family and then appearance focused ones later on what s worse is that i find few but more than i d think people in my position and they just wouldn t care as much as i would they can still have good real interactions with people and don t feel embarrassed to reveal things like they re not doing anything for their birthday i just envy that to speak my mind and not miss so many opportunities to make connections though i tell myself i don t really care about stuff like birthday parties and best friends that i want it because today s society social media or whatever i get so sad at the thought of my older sister with her many best friends that she goes out with often my younger sister who s evolving from negative loner to also being busy and hanging with her group of friends i don t think it s just society i feel like my life would genuinely be more fulfilled with more people around me who really knew me and appreciated me my concerns would be satisfied if i just became more social and popular but i would also become confident fully content if i learn to be okay being alone and go through the day having good and fun small interactions but surely that s more difficult to do especially with all the people i m surrounded with being so loved which one should i be working towards any advice for either of the two options tl dr: there are people who are more lonely and still content which i wish to be but it mentally destroys me when i compare myself and realize i don t have a bunch of people who know me or appreciate me because i m so inauthentic around everyone should i want to be more popular or want to be okay not being popular,social_anxiety
1p0zgb6,scrolling tiktok in public as of late i ve become so much more self conscious about what i do in public the way i speak walk and even scrolling tiktok i m fine when i m around my friends but when i m not i can sometimes feel my face immediately tighten and i become stoic when that happens i try to keep to myself as much as possible usually escaping to my phone things take a turn when i happen to open tiktok in all honesty i think some of my fyp is pretty funny but most of it is dumb and i just laugh out of shock so when i see something funny and i start to laugh i start to become hyper aware of the people around me i think its so funny but i feel this sense of dread that people are looking at me weirdly for just laughing randomly like a maniac i almost feel scared and i wish i could just laugh in my head and not laugh out loud like some weirdo am i just paranoid or do people actually notice and care,social_anxiety
1p0yve4,dissociating when talking to people i think i m dissociating sometimes when i m talking to people and i wondered if others here experience this too i think it s mostly happening when i m in a situation where i m sharing my thoughts about something and feel vulnerable or if i m talking to someone that i really want to like me and i m afraid of messing things up somehow the best way i can think to describe it is it s like i m talking but i m kind of on autopilot like there are words coming out of my mouth but i feel like i lose the ability to really think things through like words are coming out relatively unfiltered i feel kind of numb and it s like i m speaking and experiencing the conversation from somewhere recessed toward the back of my body i feel like that probably sounds really weird but i m hoping that will somewhat make sense and someone can relate again just wondered if that s something others experience sometimes in social situations and if you have any advice i d gladly take that too i m aware of grounding techniques and those have worked well for me for flashbacks but so far i have not had enough awareness in the moment to realize i m dissociating in order to use a grounding technique if that makes sense i m aware that i feel weird but i never make the connection in the moment that i m dissociating and need to do something to pull myself out of it,social_anxiety

1p0s4ux,i am so lost to tell you the truth i feel really embarrassed to write on here about myself and i dont even know what to write i just need to release my social anxiety has held me back from situations as long as i can remember im a 16 year old boy and find it extremely difficult to hold a conversation let alone start one i feel restrained from certain situations and it is so frustrating that i know what im doing wrong additionally im very insecure about myself especially being a late bloomer constantly worried what others say about my appearance leading me to avoid being seen infront of some people at school i have a few friends but none are true friendships to me i dont know i just feel like i cant connect with anyone and im afraid of what people think of me all the time im constantly stressed looking if others are staring at me for doing something wrong but the thing is i know the world doesnt revolve around me it is just really difficult for me to help myself ive searched up countless questions in order to help me improve as a person but i just cant i cant its been like this for years i want to change i cant even bring myself to buy stuff at shops with or without people i just fear i will do something wrong but i need to escape the barrier i put on myself also when im with my parents i dont know what it is but i just cant talk to other people like a normal 16 year old honestly my mind is jumbled right now i dont know what to do im also feeling pressured to get a job but i cant bring myself to face the challenges i cant bear to think of the wretched thought of interacting with people for many hours a day but i want to prove to people that i am normal and arent inferior im also quite skinny and underweight dont have a hairstyle dont have a fashion sense dont have a sheer purpose dont know what i want to do when im 18 i find myself overthinking every single thing of my damn life even now im questioning why im even writing all of this on the occasion im doing something well i will always think negatively even though i know i shouldnt which leads me to not doing it well as a result whatever i do to many this many seem like an overreaction and to be honest it may be im just sick and tired being afraid to make that move in situations i play some sports cricket especially and more times than i can remember i dont take the risky play or put myself out there in any sport its like im in the backseat of my own self knowing what to do but cant control it know matter how hard i try to break that barrier furthermore i lack so much common sense it is unreal i am even afraid to refill my water bottle i know it is ridiculous as i dont know what to do my attention span is deep fried and i cant focus on anything i barely find anything enjoyable when i watch a show or play a game the fun is ruined by me thinking this isnt real whats the point of it which to be fair i never used to think recently my mental health has gotten far worse and i dont know if it is hormonal problems but it seems to me it is larger than that honestly the amount of thoughts flooding my brain is mindblowing right now i could write tons more but i dont want to yap on too much even though i have for ages anyway to conclude i hope whoever reads this can help me in my situation and could possibly relate to me it would really help me to try and improve myself in life and i hope whoever reads this is also doing well currently but thank you for reading this,social_anxiety

1p0qcje,its not just the social anxiety it is also the side effects of stress that make life difficult hey guys just wanted to share my thoughts i feel like because social anxiety sets us into a constant spiral of stress and worry for me especially at school afterwards overthinking and being insecure about what you ve said sets in and all this creates constant stress and for me this stress makes me tired i can only hardly concentrate mood swings irritability and occasionally depressive moods ruin the days all because the constant stress tires the system and it makes you more stressed over time yeah just wanted to ask am i the only one :,social_anxiety

1p0fo16,social anxiety hyper sexuality and womens hi i m dealing with a really troubling problem i m 20 years old haven t really been in a relationship yet and haven t made love my romantic situation has been: from first grade onwards having one crush per year until sophomore year of high school romantic failures meaning heartbreak rejection from women too harassment from women too no stable family model which led to me being very uncomfortable showing what i feel from the beginning it was complicated and i had a very strange way of saying i love you i would kick my crush in the butt and run away i never dared tell her i loved her actually it was a classmate who told on me then i developed social anxiety during my adolescence when i was in sophomore year i smoked a big joint with my best friend and i felt like i was having feelings for him it broke me at the time i almost became schizophrenic and had suicidal thoughts afterwards after that suddenly women seemed very attractive to me whereas before i only had one crush per year so i started being very receptive to female beauty and it became even more exacerbated since i took ayahuasca a powerful psychedelic medicine changa same and ashwagandha sold as an adaptogen it s a psychotropic that increases sexual attraction for me the more time passes the more powerful this attraction becomes just seeing a woman talking to a woman triggers a chemical cocktail that makes me high the problem i have is social anxiety it s complicated with people in general with women i m attracted to it s mission impossible i don t know how create intimate connections anymore i tremble i paralyze i freeze i fall apart impossible to have a rational thought with all this stress yet i meditate a lot but despite that this tendency is stronger than me and it s also very painful this strong desire to create emotional and sexual connections and the gap with the fact that i feel unable to do it because i m completely parasitized by my mental health issues and approaching a woman is the door to reopening my wounds and feeling even worse afterwards because it s the repetition of a situation that s experienced as a personal failure i also have a lot of intrusive thoughts that are gradually losing their hold on me little by little thanks to the things i do to feel better but if i were in a relationship situation for example with the fear of losing my partner or experiencing rejection i think i would be dragged into a whirlwind of intrusive thoughts does anyone here share my situation how can i get out of this without using psychotropics in my case because that s impossible for me now i could ask how to cure social anxiety with anybody then but girls are most disabling as you see i ve already put things in place that already help realise that it s not me the problem but my conditions inner child therapy metta meditation intensive meditation intention meditation study of buddhism breathwork no fap addressing physical health issues to remove pain from the situation and consider psychotropic therapy i m trying therapies little by little tai chi qi cong who knows if this can help i thought also about playing theater but i don t feel ready right now it seems a good cure for shyness but first i would like to feel more secure and quiet i have an increasingly healthy lifestyle,social_anxiety

1p0deqq,can t walk outside without anxiety i would say i have pretty bad social anxiety it stems from traumas such as bullying and abuse i remember being an outgoing kid when i was younger but then i got bullied and abused which caused me to develop social anxiety i ve been this way since the eighth grade i think overtime though it s gotten worse as i don t talk to as many people or go outside as much as i did when i was younger i only go outside when needed such as for work or school my job has little to no socialization as we work by ourselves and at college i don t talk to anyone and just attend class and go home my social skills have kind of faded away as time has gone on due to this they ve gotten so bad though it s to a point where even saying hi or hello to someone gives me anxiety i can t even walk outside without me thinking people are going to make fun of me it feels so awkward walking when there s people driving by in their cars it feels like their eyes are on me and judging i know logically people driving by in their cars do not care about me enough to stare at me for more than five seconds but i always get this feeling in the back of my head it s honestly one of pure fear i think people are judging me and making fun of the way that i walk the way the that i look maybe they re making assumptions about me or they re annoyed that i m on the road because i m slowing the traffic down by crossing the street it s really gotten in my way of being able to go outside i don t have a car yet so i tend to order things online even though i live right next to a shopping center i hardly ever go to stores or social events i feel so anxious all the time over things so small i wish i was normal,social_anxiety
1p0coud,having social anxiety makes everything feels so awkward and embarrassing how can i get over that i feel embarrassed by literally everything i sometimes want to disappear in those moments even if it meant being dead because the embarrassment feels unbearable i know it s probably more in my head than how people actually see it but it still feels so real and overwhelming i don t know what to do in those situations i just wish i had a superpower to disappear whenever something embarrassing happens,social_anxiety

1p070gc,social anxiety and being unlikable im in my early 20 s i already have bad social anxiety but recently i ve realized that i m an extremely unlikable person i don t think this realization is a warped perception of myself due to the anxiety literally every person i ve ever befriended has ended up eventually avoiding me ignoring me or completely ghosting me never with an explanation i never understood why i ve always tried my best to be open minded kind show interest in them and in general treat them the way i would want to be treated i force myself out of my comfort zone and try my best to suppress my anxiety to be more extroverted and appealing no matter how much i try to change no one ever wants to be my friend for long some people don t even like me right off the bat and they make it very obvious i feel sad stupid and pathetic i m embarrassed of who i am i was born to be alone forever i can t even make friends online whenever i try to make a friend online i m always the one who ends up trying to keep the convo alive the other person eventually ends up taking days to reply or ghosting me i don t spam or try to be annoying i always try to keep the same energy they give i try my best to put myself out there and expose myself to situations but rejection after rejection makes it more difficult to beat social anxiety it also breaks my heart because i put so much love and energy into these friendships and no one ever gives the energy back i give up,social_anxiety
